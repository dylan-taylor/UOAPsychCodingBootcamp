1
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:29,083
<i>Wish: To want something
that cannot or probably will not happen.</i>

2
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,583
<i>But what if it does?</i>

3
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,125
<i> I got a smile taking over my face </i>

4
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,458
<i> Feeling the sunshine
All over the place </i>

5
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,833
<i> If it's for real
You're gonna feel it in your soul </i>

6
00:00:56,916 --> 00:01:00,125
<i> If it's for real
You're gonna feel it in your bones </i>

7
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:03,666
{\an8}<i> Clapping my hands
When I walk down the street </i>

8
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,000
{\an8}Oh yeah.

9
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,750
{\an8}<i> If it's for real
You're gonna feel it in your soul </i>

10
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:13,541
{\an8}<i> If it's for real
You're gonna feel it in your bones </i>

11
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,541
<i> Can you feel it, feel it? </i>

12
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,750
<i> Can you feel it, feel it?
Can you feel it, feel it? </i>

13
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,125
<i> Can you feel it, feel it? </i>

14
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,958
<i> Can you feel it, feel it?
Can you feel it, feel it? </i>

15
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,625
<i> Can you feel it, feel it?
Can you feel it now? </i>

16
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,625
<i> Ooh </i>

17
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,791
<i> It's all just something you feel </i>

18
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,458
<i> Ooh </i>

19
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,333
<i> That's when you know it's for real </i>

20
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,875
<i> This is for real </i>

21
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,583
<i> This is it </i>

22
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,333
<i> This is for real, this is it </i>

23
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,125
Paul! Paul!

24
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,083
A few words, Paul, Paul...

25
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:54,041
<i> This is for real, this is it </i>

26
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,291
<i> Boom, boom, boom </i>

27
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,250
<i> Bang, bang, bang... </i>

28
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,375
Oh! Ah!

29
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:04,458
Wait! Hey, wait, that's my scarf! Stop!

30
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:14,000
<i> This is for real, this is it </i>

31
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,416
<i> This is for real </i>

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Hi, beautiful.

33
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,375
Mwah.

34
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,500
Hi, you. You look great.

35
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,583
Oh, thanks, thanks.

36
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,958
- Paul!
- Paul! Right over here.

37
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,791
- Two seconds.
- Okay.

38
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:31,166
Hi, how you doing? Good to see you again.
How are you? Thank you so much for coming.

39
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,041
- A few questions.
- Hang on a second. Hang on.

40
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:38,583
I'd be nowhere without this amazing woman
and brilliant writer in her own right,

41
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,458
my book editor, Madeline Kelly.

42
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,416
- Maddie, come here. Come here.
- Oh.

43
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,708
This is our night, Maddie.
You and me, we did this together.

44
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,166
You wrote a great story, Paul.
I just helped you polish it up.

45
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,583
Save me a moment inside, will you?
I have something I want to talk about.

46
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,041
- What is it?
- You'll see.

47
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,708
- Okay.
- Okay.

48
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,125
- Quick question.
- Hi, Jay.

49
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:04,083
So, was there a particular lady
in your life that inspired the love story?

50
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,166
Well, come on, you know,
I can't give away all of my secrets.

51
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,750
- Always good to be back.
- Yeah? Another bestseller?

52
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:13,666
Hello?

53
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,875
{\an8}- Oh, Maddie.
<i>- Hi, Mom.</i>

54
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,250
{\an8}Glad I caught you.

55
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,875
{\an8}<i>What's that clicking noise?</i>

56
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,583
I'm trying to order toilet paper online.

57
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,541
The students keep stealing it,

58
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,666
and the button on my keyboard

59
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,791
<i>keeps getting stuck.</i>

60
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,041
Too much detail, Mom.

61
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,333
Well, you asked.

62
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,750
It's a little hectic here.

63
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,541
I got stuck in traffic, and I just

64
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,166
<i>literally got to the venue.</i>

65
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,958
You're gonna be late for your big night.
It's bad time management.

66
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,875
<i>I wish I could've been there to help you.</i>

67
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,583
- Okay, Mom, can you hang on a second?
<i>- Of course.</i>

68
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah, just one second.

69
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,541
Okay, go ahead.

70
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,500
<i>I was calling</i>

71
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,166
to see if you've had that talk with Paul.

72
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,458
Not yet. I hope you haven't told anyone
about my feelings for him.

73
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,083
Trust me.

74
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,541
No one in Des Moines cares.

75
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,708
Well, Heather and Emma don't even know.

76
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,083
<i>You didn't tell them?</i>

77
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,875
<i>I'm just... I'm not ready.</i>

78
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,500
If your friends don't know,

79
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,958
it's entirely possible
that Paul doesn't either.

80
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,958
No, I've given him plenty of signs.

81
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,666
<i>You should see the way he looks at me
when we work together.</i>

82
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,500
<i>- Mom, he gets me.</i>
- Well, you're in love with him.

83
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,041
<i>- Why don't you just tell him?</i>
- I may not have to.

84
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,625
<i>Oh. What's happened?</i>

85
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,833
<i>He says he has to talk to me
about something.</i>

86
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,041
<i>- Really?</i>
- So tonight may be the night.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,625
Ah! It works.

88
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,958
Okay, Mom, I have to go.

89
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,916
<i>All right. If he doesn't tell you
how he feels about you tonight,</i>

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,958
you gotta speak up. That's all I'll say.

91
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,666
- Okay, love you. Bye.
<i>- Love you too.</i>

92
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,250
- Hey, girls!
- Hi!

93
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,083
This is so exciting.

94
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,208
We are so proud of you.

95
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,791
- Thank you for coming.
- Oh, where's the scarf I gave you to wear?

96
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,458
- Somewhere in Brooklyn by now.
- How'd that happen?

97
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,833
Freak accident. I totally get if you
never wanna loan me anything again.

98
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:56,375
Don't worry about it, Mads.
That scarf was a sample from work.

99
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,583
Heather, great job on the cover art.

100
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,666
You like it?

101
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,125
It's stunning. What do you think, Emma?

102
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,916
- I think you've been holding out on us.
- On what? Paul?

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,583
Yeah, you've been working
with him for over a year.

104
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,416
Don't tell me you haven't noticed.

105
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,000
I think he's an amazing writer.
That's all.

106
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,333
You should have
your name on the cover with him.

107
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,166
- You practically wrote the book.
- No, I didn't.

108
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,958
I mean, not exactly.

109
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,708
Besides, it's good for my career.

110
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,833
Paul's talking me up to the publisher.

111
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,166
- He's Irish.
- Yes.

112
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,208
- Does he have a sexy accent?
- Haven't noticed.

113
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,958
- Is he single?
- Give me that.

114
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,583
- Okay.
- Where are you going?

115
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,791
To find Paul.

116
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,166
<i> And in your eyes </i>

117
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,875
<i> True love resides </i>

118
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,250
<i> Forever is a word that tries... </i>

119
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,583
Come on, Maddie. Don't wimp out now.

120
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,708
Here you are.

121
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:58,333
Thought I'd use a little liquid courage
before going in to face the masses.

122
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,625
They're gonna love it.
It's a beautiful story.

123
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,166
Well, I have you to thank for that.

124
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,750
If I had my way,

125
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,511
the lovers would have tossed themselves
into the lake by chapter ten.

126
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,166
You're amazing. You know that?

127
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,541
You balance me out, Madeline.

128
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,500
We do make a great team.

129
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,916
We do, which is why
I wanted to talk to you

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,625
about something really important to me.

131
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,375
- You know you can tell me anything.
- Well...

132
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,916
I feel like it's time

133
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,708
we take our relationship
to the next level.

134
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,875
Oh, Paul, I don't know what to say.

135
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,958
I feel exactly the same way.

136
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,208
Really?

137
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,000
That's wonderful.

138
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,166
So,

139
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,791
will you work with me on my next book?

140
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,666
I want to bring you in
from the conception of the story.

141
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,041
I know you wanted to write your own novel.
I can help you with that.

142
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,166
But do you think it could wait
just... a little longer?

143
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,291
Oh, I, uh...

144
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,083
- Sure.
- Great!

145
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,625
- Sounds great.
- Wonderful!

146
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,041
- Yeah.
- Well...

147
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,750
Right, time to feed me to the wolves.

148
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,333
See you in there.

149
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,000
Well, if you stop moving, I can grab it.

150
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,083
Just get me to the bathroom.

151
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,500
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

152
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,666
We're just having
a minor eyelash malfunction.

153
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,458
May I offer my assistance?

154
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,500
Oh, uh, yeah. Maybe.
They're the new NanoGrip lashes.

155
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,250
I'm a stylist at Bergdorf's.

156
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,291
I get the latest samples
of all their luxury cosmetics.

157
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,375
This one gets a thumbs-down.

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,208
- Do you mind if I give it a go?
- Sure.

159
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,250
I'll be very, very careful.

160
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,083
There.

161
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,833
How's that?

162
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:44,916
Much better.

163
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,625
Um, hey.

164
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,388
Hate to break this up, but you have
a lot of people waiting for you.

165
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,083
- Okay, well, after you.
- Oh no, after you.

166
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,208
Ugh.

167
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,875
"She peers up from the watery depths."

168
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,916
"If only he would reach out for her,

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,541
it could break the spell."

170
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,208
"But instead, he turns his back."

171
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,416
"She calls out with drowned words

172
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,458
as he disappears
into the shadows of the mossy glen."

173
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:25,916
"Chapter eight."

174
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,875
"The first night
she spent alone was the worst."

175
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,291
TWO IRISH HEARTS
PAUL KENNEDY

176
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,041
There you go, Gertrude.
That's a beautiful name, by the way.

177
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,416
Thank you, Paul.

178
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,208
- So, how did you three meet?
- Oh, we're friends from school.

179
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,208
I was always a big reader.

180
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,458
What?

181
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,541
That was me.

182
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,666
- Would you like me to sign your book?
- Oh, uh, yes, I would.

183
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,625
Of course.

184
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,083
- Here we go.
- Is that a real lake?

185
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,291
{\an8}Yes. It's in Ireland.
It's not far from my family's home.

186
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,291
Hmm, well, I'd love to see it sometime.

187
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,458
And I would love
for you to see it sometime.

188
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:09,166
You write such amazing stories.
I could listen to them all night.

189
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,750
Wow.

190
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,166
Wouldn't that be great?

191
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,416
Unfortunately,
Paul has press in the morning, so...

192
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,583
Check, please.

193
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,583
- It's an open bar.
- No, it's not.

194
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,333
It was amazing.

195
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,583
Yes.

196
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,708
This might have been
the most incredible night of my life.

197
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,500
You and Paul seemed to hit it off.

198
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,333
I know, it's like we had
this immediate connection.

199
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,583
Well, you can't take it too seriously.
Paul's a famous person.

200
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,041
- He's used to making people feel special.
- Well, he signed my book.

201
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,625
He signs a lot of books.

202
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,166
With his phone number?

203
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,166
It's just a phone number.

204
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,541
It's not like it's a proposal.

205
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,708
I can't believe Paul and Emma
are getting married.

206
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,000
It all happened so fast.

207
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,583
Like whiplash.

208
00:09:58,958 --> 00:09:59,958
Welcome to Ireland.

209
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,166
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,083
Nearly there. You've got one more bag.

211
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,958
Oh Paul, that one's mine too.

212
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,458
- There you go.
- Did you bring enough luggage, Em?

213
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,875
I'm getting married.

214
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,166
You won't believe the number
of wardrobe changes I'm gonna need.

215
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,291
Oh.

216
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,583
Excuse me. Ma'am.

217
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,916
- Mads.
- Excuse me.

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,541
- Are you okay?
- Sure.

219
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,458
Maddie, have you got your bag?

220
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,583
Almost.

221
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,083
- We'll meet you out front, okay?
- Okay.

222
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:32,708
If you need me on that job,
I'm available at a moment's notice. Okay?

223
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,041
Good. All right. Yeah, of course. Mm-hmm.

224
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,166
Yeah.

225
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,250
- Oh.
- Oh, sorry. This is mine.

226
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,041
Uh, no, I'm afraid it's mine.

227
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,666
- No, actually it's mine.
- Hang on a minute.

228
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,000
There's an American woman
trying to steal my bag.

229
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,291
I'm not. I'm trying to take my bag.

230
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,833
If you just look at the tag, you'll see.

231
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,041
I don't need to. I know my own bag.

232
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:53,958
So let go.

233
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,583
I'm not letting go of my bag.

234
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,291
Oh!

235
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,708
See? Look, my favorite plaid skirt.

236
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,416
Are you sure those are your size?

237
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,083
I'm so sorry.

238
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,000
It's quite all right.
It could have happened to anyone.

239
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,083
Although I suspect
it happens to you more often than most.

240
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,791
- Enjoy your visit.
- Hmm.

241
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,583
LOST LUGGAGE

242
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,625
Ah, Maddie. There you are.

243
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,666
We finally managed to get
all of Emma's bags into the car.

244
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,416
I may have to ride on the roof.

245
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,541
- Can't believe this is actually happening.
- I know. How are you feeling?

246
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,875
No cold feet, right?

247
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,500
Me? Never.

248
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,750
I can't thank you enough
for introducing me to Emma.

249
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,625
You've changed my life,
and I'll never forget it.

250
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,583
Can you please fill this out?

251
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,083
Looks like this is gonna take a while.

252
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,416
- Why don't you guys head to the house?
- No. I can't leave you here.

253
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,083
- Don't worry about me. I'll take a taxi.
- Okay.

254
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,625
Call me, let me know everything's okay.

255
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,708
Good.

256
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,500
"No Ubers in the area." Great.

257
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,750
Can you go to this address?

258
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,833
Oh, yeah. I can take you there, love.

259
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,125
- Okay.
- Yeah.

260
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,541
{\an8}Whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait!

261
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,541
Billy. Oh, good to see you again.

262
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,625
Ah.

263
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,458
Couldn't convince anyone else
to give you their bag?

264
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,416
As a matter of fact, my bag is missing,
but they'll call me when they find it.

265
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Well, if you're in need of boxer shorts,
you know who to ask.

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So, you're a photographer?

267
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,125
I am.

268
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,583
A nature photographer.

269
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,208
Well, at least I'm trying to be.

270
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:26,500
It's a little trickier now the whole world
carries a camera in their pocket.

271
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,208
Never thought about that.

272
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,875
- What brings you to Ireland?
- A wedding.

273
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,583
- Oh, congratulations.
- Oh, no. It's... it's not mine.

274
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,166
It's my friend's.

275
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,500
Maybe you'll be lucky
to catch the bouquet.

276
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,666
What makes you think
I wanna get married?

277
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,750
Nothing. It was a joke.

278
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,166
Apparently, a bad one.

279
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,875
Oh!

280
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,041
{\an8}TWO IRISH HEARTS

281
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,125
Oh.

282
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:56,833
Huh.

283
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,708
- Thanks.
- All right.

284
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,916
You enjoying that?

285
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,458
Yes. Have you read it?

286
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,708
Nope. Don't need to.

287
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,333
I barely made it through his last one.

288
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,500
Paul Kennedy's one
of the best-selling authors in the UK.

289
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,583
They sell a lot of fish and chips too.
Doesn't mean they're any good.

290
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:19,041
Well, he seems to be doing
very well without your approval.

291
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,958
Not a friend of yours, is he?

292
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,791
Your stop coming up, Miss.
Kennedy House.

293
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Ah.

294
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,041
As in Paul?

295
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,916
Well, that answers that question.

296
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,250
- Thank you.
- No bother, love.

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,416
Oh, and, FYI, I edited this book.

298
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,458
{\an8}So, what do you have to say to that?

299
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,750
My deepest sympathies.

300
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,041
You know what? You can just go...

301
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,833
Hey, you.

302
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,333
- You're trespassing, you know.
- Uh, I'm sorry.

303
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,083
I'm-I'm looking for Paul Kennedy.

304
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,375
I know who you are.
Just having a bit of fun.

305
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,875
I'm Kory, the brother.

306
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,250
- Hi.
- Come on, everyone's inside.

307
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh, Maddie! You made it!

308
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,583
Yeah, I took the bus, which was fine,

309
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,541
except for the cheeky English guy
I had to ride with.

310
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,833
Olivia, this china is divine.

311
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,541
You have an excellent eye. It's Belleek.

312
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,791
- Oh.
- It's been in the family for generations.

313
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,583
Just this way.

314
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,166
Oh wow.

315
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,625
This place looks like a fairy tale.

316
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,166
Except around here,
if you lose your shoe at midnight,

317
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,250
you're just drunk.

318
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,208
He's so cute.

319
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,250
- Wow, really?
- I've got Maddie here. Fresh off the bus.

320
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,392
- Hey, Maddie.
- Good.

321
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,125
- Sean. Paul's dad.
- Hi.

322
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,625
Oh, no!

323
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,708
Um, I'm so sorry.

324
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,208
Quite all right.

325
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,791
- No damage done.
- Yes, sir.

326
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,166
Have they found your luggage?

327
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,000
- No, not yet.
- Come join us.

328
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,541
Oh, Mads, I'm sorry.

329
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,250
It's okay.

330
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,416
It was insured.

331
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,791
It's not the bag we're worried about.
It's the bridesmaid's dress.

332
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,708
Without it, you'll imbalance
the look of the wedding party.

333
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,833
Maybe she could stand-off to one side.
You know, like a cheering section.

334
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,208
Right! The car is loaded up.

335
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,166
Ah.

336
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,500
Madeline. Everybody about ready to go?

337
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,541
- Oh yeah.
- Where are we going?

338
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:57,541
Paul's planned a surprise trip for us all.
Isn't he sweet?

339
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,791
Mwah.

340
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,642
- Just give me a sec to get changed.
- Mm-hmm.

341
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,541
Such a lovely young woman.

342
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,166
She's adorable.

343
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,291
Madeline, you must be
so thrilled for them both.

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,750
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

345
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,125
SCRUFFY MURPHY'S PUB & INN

346
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,166
You all right? Good.

347
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,708
Afternoon. How are we, chaps?

348
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,416
That looks good.

349
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,625
Ah.

350
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,958
There's the world traveler.

351
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,375
Good to see you, Murphy.

352
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,250
Doing well? How's it going?

353
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:37,000
Oh, fine, fine. So, are you around
for a week this time?

354
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,041
I am. Yeah, I'm covering
the sheep-shearing festival.

355
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,916
Oh, there's great excitement
around here for that one.

356
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,541
I'm sure.

357
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,708
Now Fionnuala is getting your room ready,

358
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,916
and you can use
my old Triumph while you're here.

359
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,166
No, no, no, no. I can't take your car.

360
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,416
Look, you can trade me
with one of your fancy photographs.

361
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,125
And I'll hang it up in the pub.

362
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,041
All right, deal.

363
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,583
You're still liking it?

364
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,166
All this gallivanting around the world?

365
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,208
Snapping pictures
of lizards and birds, huh?

366
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,125
I am.

367
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,875
If you don't stay put,

368
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:12,416
how are you going to find
a nice woman to settle down with you?

369
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,208
I'm not sure I'm cut out
for settling down with anyone.

370
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,916
What am I telling you for?
You've never listened to me anyway.

371
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,750
- Good to see you, man.
- All right.

372
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:35,958
Beautiful.

373
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,000
Hey! You need anything?
I can lend you some clothes.

374
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,541
- No, I'm good. I had a sweater in my bag.
- Okay.

375
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,875
- Gorgeous view.
- Yep.

376
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,500
Is everything okay with you?
You seem a little off.

377
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,791
Yeah. No, uh, I'm good. I'm great.

378
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,083
Why don't we have a girls' night?
We can go out, get a couple drinks,

379
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,625
meet some guys.

380
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:08,208
You haven't dated in almost a year
since you started writing that book.

381
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,791
- Just say yes. Come on, come on!
- Yes.

382
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,666
Thank you. I'll see you downstairs in 15.

383
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,416
- Happy couple taking us on a picnic.
- Ugh.

384
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,083
Thank you.

385
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,541
- I'll take the basket.
- Lovely. I'll take the heavy thing.

386
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,916
Right, follow me. Let's have a picnic.

387
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,458
It's so pretty here.

388
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,916
This bridge was used by the Vikings.

389
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,166
This must be where
you get all your creative inspiration.

390
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,166
Look, it's Lough Tay.

391
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,083
- It's the lake from Paul's book.
- Ah.

392
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,333
Oh, it's beautiful.

393
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,916
Is this where your mystical fairy lives,

394
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,958
in a sunken city
at the bottom of the lake?

395
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,500
- Yeah, exactly. You're so perceptive.
- Except she's not mystical.

396
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:05,041
She's wicked and selfish,
and she lures men to their watery deaths.

397
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,791
- Maddie!
- No, that's right.

398
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,250
Evil fairy.

399
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,958
Anyone fancy a boat trip?

400
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,208
- Oh!
- I do.

401
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,791
Nevin put some boats aside for us.

402
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,791
- Maddie, come on, we can squeeze you in.
- Oh, it's okay.

403
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,083
There's plenty of room. It'll be fun.

404
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,958
- I'm just gonna go for a walk.
- Really? Okay.

405
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,541
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

406
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,666
- Could we get a picture?
- Oh, okay.

407
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,517
- Cheese!
- Woo-hoo!

408
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,458
How about one of Paul and I?

409
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:38,625
Here, use my phone.
That way, I can post on my stories later.

410
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,208
Okay. Uh, one, two, three.

411
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,184
- Think the water's warm?
- Here you go.

412
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,291
Thank you, Mads.

413
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,250
- I am so excited by this.
- All right, have fun.

414
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,166
- See you later.
- Enjoy your walk.

415
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,833
- And we're off.
- Oh, it's lovely.

416
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,125
I'm counting on you.

417
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,291
Bye, guys.

418
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,083
- See you, Maddie!
- Bye!

419
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,250
We're off.

420
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,333
- Hi, Mom.
<i>- You promised you'd call when you landed.</i>

421
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,416
Sorry. I am safe and sound.

422
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,916
Actually, Paul took us to Lough Tay.
It's really magical in person.

423
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,791
Is there something in your voice?
Are you all right?

424
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,958
<i>Yeah, I'm okay, but...</i>

425
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,250
I can't help but think
that things would be different

426
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,166
if I'd just taken your advice
and told Paul how I felt.

427
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,083
<i>Sweetheart,
think of this as a lesson learned.</i>

428
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,250
You're gonna have
to start speaking up for yourself.

429
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,500
Stop that.

430
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,583
<i>Yeah, well,</i>

431
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,250
it's too late now.

432
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,666
It's not like I can tell Paul
I wish he was marrying me instead of Emma.

433
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,958
<i>Maddie?</i>

434
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,208
- Mom?
- Maddie? Maddie?

435
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,000
Mom, it's... it's reconnecting.

436
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,083
Mom?

437
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,041
Oh! Whoa!

438
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,291
Was that a wish you were making?

439
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,833
Oh, no, I was just, um...

440
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,250
I mean, I guess,
but I didn't think anyone was listening.

441
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:34,916
Well, I was.

442
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,416
Look down.

443
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Okay.

444
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:42,416
They call that a wishing chair,
but you have to do it right.

445
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:47,416
So, sit down,
close your eyes and make your wish.

446
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,791
Oh, no, I'm good.

447
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,916
What are you afraid of?

448
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,333
I'm not afraid. I just...
I don't believe in that kind of thing.

449
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,583
Well, then you have nothing to lose.

450
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,833
Oh, come on. Why not give it a go?

451
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,291
Okay, I wish...

452
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,500
No, you have to do it right. Sit down.

453
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,583
Close your eyes and mean it.

454
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,041
Okay, I wish...

455
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,875
I wish I was marrying Paul Kennedy.

456
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,208
Oh.

457
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,291
Well, that didn't work.

458
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,625
Didn't it? And how can you tell?

459
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:32,541
Isn't there supposed to be an earthquake
or a lightning bolt or something?

460
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,791
So you want something more theatrical?

461
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:39,375
Let me see if I can muster up
a stiff breeze. Would that help?

462
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,083
That would be nice.

463
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:49,833
Whoa!

464
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:50,916
Oh!

465
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,416
Oh!

466
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,291
That was a weird dream.

467
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,833
Hello?

468
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,041
Hello?

469
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,333
Heather?

470
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:34,875
Emma?

471
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:36,791
Are you in there?

472
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,416
Paul!

473
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,333
Ah, Maddie, you're up.
Can you hand me a towel?

474
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,375
Uh, sure.

475
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:46,958
Yeah. Okay. Um...

476
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,833
Um, Paul, what are you doing in here?

477
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:53,636
Taking a shower. What does it look like?
Have you seen my beard balm?

478
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:54,625
No!

479
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,375
Ow! Oh!

480
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:57,666
What's wrong with you?

481
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,833
Nothing, I just, um...
I didn't know you were in here.

482
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,916
- Where else would I be?
- Right. Okay.

483
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,708
Oh! Uh, I'm-I'm gonna go. Right. So sorry.

484
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:10,791
Whoa! Oh!

485
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,333
Maddie! Are you all right?

486
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:16,041
- They found my suitcase.
- Come here.

487
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,708
Huh!

488
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,875
You know what? I'm gonna go outside.
I'll just... Yeah, I'm gonna get some air.

489
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,750
- Oh, morning, Mads.
- Hi, Emma.

490
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:34,291
Emma! You're up early.

491
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:37,166
I'll get a run in before breakfast.
Have you seen Paul?

492
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,916
- Paul?
- I've been looking for him everywhere.

493
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,083
You know, you can get lost in this house.

494
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:46,000
Yeah, well, uh,
he is definitely not in there. At all.

495
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,541
- Right.
- You know what?

496
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:50,833
As a matter of fact, I haven't seen
an inch of him anywhere.

497
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,583
What? How did he get in there?

498
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:54,976
- Morning, Emma.
- Morning.

499
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,083
- Your mother's looking for you downstairs.
- Oh. Great, thanks.

500
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:01,125
- I'll see you at breakfast?
- Whoa. Paul.

501
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:04,083
What? It's not like
she's never seen us kiss before.

502
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,500
Nevin, my jacket.

503
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,750
So, uh, getting ready
for the big day, huh?

504
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,250
You must be getting excited.

505
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,541
I'm looking forward to the reception.

506
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:17,416
There are some seriously hot men
in this town.

507
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:18,916
See?

508
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,000
Oh.

509
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,166
- Oh. Hey, are you...
- I need to talk to you.

510
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,958
What in the world, Mads? What is wrong?

511
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,250
I'm gonna tell you something,

512
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:33,375
but you cannot breathe
a word of this to Emma.

513
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,000
Oh. All right.

514
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:38,000
Last night, I had the craziest dream.

515
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:41,375
We were by the lake,
and this odd lady told me to make a wish.

516
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:44,791
And I wished
that I was marrying Paul Kennedy.

517
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:48,750
- I know that probably shocks you.
- Should it?

518
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:49,833
Well, anyway,

519
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:54,541
when I woke up from the dream,
my suitcase magically appeared,

520
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:58,750
and Paul was taking a shower. In there!

521
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,416
Okay.

522
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,291
Isn't that a bit weird to you?

523
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:03,833
Uh...

524
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,708
And there's a wedding dress
in my suitcase!

525
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:08,791
Uh, yeah.

526
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:12,250
- Why is it in there?
- Because it's yours, silly.

527
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,041
You and your mom
picked it out in New York.

528
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,041
What?

529
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:16,875
Yeah, and in a couple of days,

530
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:20,041
you're gonna put it on,
walk down the aisle, and get married!

531
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,416
No, I'm not!

532
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,750
Yes, you are.

533
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:25,333
I think you're having
a little pre-wedding anxiety.

534
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:27,583
- Perfectly normal.
- I mean, what are these?

535
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:28,666
These aren't mine.

536
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:31,041
Girl, sexy heels for your honeymoon.

537
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:35,625
No. I am not the one
who's getting married.

538
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:36,750
She is!

539
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:39,125
Exactly.

540
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:43,583
You, my friend, are marrying Paul Kennedy.

541
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:45,166
Now, just breathe. Relax.

542
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,375
This is gonna be
the best weekend of your life.

543
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,458
Get dressed.

544
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm marrying Paul Kennedy.

545
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Yes!

546
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,083
I'm marrying Paul Kennedy!

547
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,166
Ah!

548
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,666
Whoo! Yes!

549
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:18,625
- Okay, so...
- Well, I just don't understand it.

550
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:21,625
Why can I not find
a photographer for this wedding?

551
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,958
Because you're horrible, Mum.

552
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:27,583
The last two photographers
you hired for our parties left in tears.

553
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,875
- Did they really?
- Yes.

554
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,000
They did. They were crying and everything.

555
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:35,750
Oh, there she is.

556
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:39,291
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

557
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,750
I'm digging this groove.

558
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:45,958
Uh, darling?

559
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:47,833
Oh.

560
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:48,916
Allow me.

561
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:50,708
Thank you.

562
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:54,375
- Are you feeling all right, Madeline?
- Yes. Just a little jet-lagged.

563
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,875
Have some champagne. It's working for me.

564
00:28:59,041 --> 00:28:59,875
Thank you.

565
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,958
Try these local woodland strawberries.
They're delicious.

566
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,958
Let me give you one. Very good.

567
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:11,500
- None for me, thank you.
- Madeline might want one.

568
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,250
Madeline, would you like a boxty?

569
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,500
A what?

570
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:17,500
Oh, she's so adorable.
Um, it's an Irish pancake.

571
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:18,625
Oh, okay, thank you.

572
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:20,958
Sean, I meant to tell you.
The bakery called.

573
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:23,958
The wedding cake we ordered
is too tall for the delivery truck.

574
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,208
- Oh, no.
- Could you get a smaller cake?

575
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:27,166
Very good.

576
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,875
- I like your thinking.
- Well done, dear.

577
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Finally, someone with some sense.

578
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:37,583
Well, the weather seems to be holding up.
You fancy a bike ride this morning?

579
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,458
- Oh, with me?
- Mm-hmm.

580
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:43,291
Of course with me.

581
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:46,750
Emma and I are going down
to the orchard to pick some apples.

582
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:50,416
- Kory, do you want to come with us?
- I can't. I've got rugby practice.

583
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,750
Paul, can we go pick apples?

584
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,833
I'm not really
that coordinated on a bicycle.

585
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:56,041
Don't be silly.
Everyone knows how to ride a bike.

586
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,708
Sweetheart, can you
pick up the pace a little?

587
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:06,000
Paul, I'm trying.

588
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,083
These are so luscious.

589
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:17,166
- Maddie, you still back there?
- I'm coming.

590
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,583
- Oh, hey.
- Hi, ladies.

591
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,041
Hey, Maddie.

592
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:25,250
Whoa! Whoa!

593
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,416
Ah!

594
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,041
Oh!

595
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,666
- Maddie, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

596
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,541
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'll just hop back on.

597
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,708
I don't know, you kind of look like
a liability on that thing.

598
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:40,541
Oh, no, I'll just push it
and trot along next to you.

599
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,333
Well, I was kind of hoping
to get some cardio in, babe.

600
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:46,375
- It's okay. I'll take it from you, Maddie.
- No.

601
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,166
Could use a bike ride.
I'm low on my steps.

602
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,791
- All right then!
- Alright.

603
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:53,000
- Quick little trip around the village?
- Only if you can keep up with me.

604
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:55,750
- Whoo!
- Them fighting words.

605
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah, left you in my dust!

606
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,666
I'm gonna get you.

607
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,291
So, want to pick some apples?

608
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,000
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

609
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:10,333
I literally cannot believe
we got so many apples.

610
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:14,250
How about we make an apple pie for Kory?
Maybe he likes a girl that can bake.

611
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:19,250
There you are.
I've been looking for you everywhere.

612
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,833
Madeline, do you realize what time it is?

613
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:25,583
We have an appointment at the tailor's
for the fitting of your wedding dress.

614
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:29,750
Oh, but don't I already have a dress?
My mom and I picked it out together.

615
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:31,250
Oh, speaking of your mother.

616
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:34,133
Nevin will collect her from the airport
and bring her to the rehearsal.

617
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,416
- My mother's coming?
- Better late than never.

618
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,416
Yeah, I agree with you.

619
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,166
I don't see a problem
with guys using Botox.

620
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,375
Right? I mean, I don't need it now,
but maybe in the future.

621
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:45,458
Oh hey, Em.

622
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,791
- Hey.
- Hi.

623
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,958
Paul, darling, I thought you told Madeline
about the wedding dress.

624
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,041
I did.

625
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:52,708
- Right, honey?
- No.

626
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,291
Well, anyway, come on.

627
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,916
- Well, she's no fun.
- My mom can handle her.

628
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,041
It fits her like a dream.

629
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:09,750
Spectacular.

630
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:10,916
Magnificent.

631
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:13,000
- Wow.
- Wow.

632
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,333
My grandmother
wore that gown on her wedding day.

633
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,375
So did my mother. So did I.

634
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,291
It's a tradition in our family, Madeline.

635
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,250
It's really... fun.

636
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,583
"Fun"?

637
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:27,250
It's vintage Lanvin.

638
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:32,333
It is a fashion artifact.
It is the sphinx of wedding gowns.

639
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:35,041
Maybe you could add a slit?

640
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:37,708
Hmm.

641
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,083
Brilliant. They have it.

642
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,750
REWILDING

643
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,473
- Fantastic.
- It is lovely.

{\an8}- That's okay. It's fine, thanks.
- But it's free.

654
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,958
Even so.

655

Oh.

657
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:16,333
- Little gift.
- Of course.

658
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:18,625
- One of this.
- Lovely.

659
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,541
Oh, and the payment. There you go.

660
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,958
Perfect.

WEST COAST RARE BOOKS

667
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:44,166
Oh, come on. You've got to be joking.

668
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,375
I was looking forward to that gig.

669
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:51,625
- It's really not that bad.
- Yes, it is. What are you talking about?

670
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:55,958
- What are you gonna do about this, Maddie?
- Well, I'm just gonna wear the dress.

671
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:59,166
Because it's only a dress
and because Paul wants me to.

672
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,958
<i>And because you wished it.</i>

673
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,333
Did you just hear that?

674
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:03,750
There she is.

675
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,553
That's her!
She's right there. There she is!

676
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:06,875
Oh...

677
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,166
Who? Maddie!

678
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,750
Hey, wait, come back!

679
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,000
What does that mean?
I'm happy with my wish.

680
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:24,750
<i>Are you really happy with your wish?</i>

681
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,375
Where are you going?

682
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:30,916
I love my wish.
Come back! Please don't take it away!

683
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:33,666
Whoa!

684
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:36,708
Hello.

685
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,791
- It's you.
- You all right?

686
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:44,000
- You didn't see me crossing the street?
- Well, yes, but you ran into me, so...

687
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,666
- Well...
- There you go.

688
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,500
It's okay. I got it.

689
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:55,750
- Here.
- Oh. Well done.

690
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,375
Hey.

691
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,958
You told me you didn't like Paul's books.

692
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:03,583
- Sorry, what?
- When we were on the bus.

693
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:06,750
I don't mean to be rude,
but do I know you?

694
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:07,875
You don't remember?

695
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:12,666
- Oh, that's because it didn't happen.
- What didn't happen?

696
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,375
- Nothing.
- Maddie!

697
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:18,041
- What was that about? You just ran off.
- I, um, I saw...

698
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:22,625
You found one. A photographer.
Wonderful. Well done, Madeline.

699
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:23,833
No, I...

700
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,750
Olivia Kennedy. And you are?

701
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,000
James. James Thomas. Lovely to meet you.

702
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,708
I don't suppose you're any relation
to Paul Kennedy, the author?

703
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:33,708
That's my son.

704
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:36,333
- Ah.
- This is his bride-to-be.

705
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:39,250
- Of course you already knew that.
- I didn't, actually.

706
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:42,166
The thing is,
James is not that kind of photographer.

707
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,375
How do you know that?

708
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,517
- You're a photographer?
- I am.

709
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:46,750
What would you charge?

710
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:50,208
I appreciate the offer,
but I don't think I'm the man for the job.

711
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,000
What do you mean?

712
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,125
I don't really photograph people.

713
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:58,000
Whatever your fee is, I will triple it.

714
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,625
When did you say the wedding was?

715
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,250
You see how there's this beautiful glow
around the bride and groom.

716
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,017
- It's lovely.
- That's what I'm looking for.

717
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,125
Something ethereal.

718
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,791
And then any photographs of me
should be taken from the right.

719
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:14,125
That is my better side.

720
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:16,125
All right.

721
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,583
Whose car is in the middle of the drive?

722
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:34,875
Hey.

723
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,916
Oh, good, darling. You're just in time.

724
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,833
Madeline found
a wedding photographer for us.

725
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:40,750
Oh!

726
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:43,541
James Thomas, this is Paul, my fiancé.

727
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,458
- I've read some of your work.
- Oh.

728
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:48,666
- It's always nice to meet a fan.
- Yes, I'm sure it is.

729
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,791
You know, my publicist said

730
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,041
that we should get
some PR pictures after the wedding

731
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:57,083
of Madeline and I
in some idyllic Irish backdrops.

732
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:59,625
He thinks it'll help
boost my sales figures.

733
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:02,166
So not just a wedding
but a good PR event too.

734
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,125
Yeah, exactly.

735
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:05,351
Especially since
Maddie is Paul's book editor.

736
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:08,375
Why don't the three of you spend tomorrow
driving around the area?

737
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:11,208
- You might find some great spots.
- That sounds wonderful.

738
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:13,250
- What do you think, Paul?
- It's a great idea.

739
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,750
- 10:00 a.m., James?
- Sure.

740
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,958
Madeline, would you mind
showing James out?

741
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,041
Sure.

742
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:25,291
So you're not just his fiancée
but his editor too.

743
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,000
How convenient.

744
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:30,333
If you're gonna spend the day with us,
can you leave your snark at home?

745
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:34,000
Since I don't technically have a home,
I don't know where that would be.

746
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:37,208
I'll do my best.

747
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,333
I suppose I should
be thanking you for the job.

748
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,833
I don't mind saying
it's gonna come in very handy.

749
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:48,583
Now that the world
has a camera in their pocket?

750
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,083
It's what I always say.

751
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:52,166
Really?

752
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,708
Yeah.

753
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,041
- See you in the morning.
- Yep.

754
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:28,708
Hmm.

755
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:31,166
Guess what?

756
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,083
<i>You</i> are marrying Paul Kennedy.

757
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:36,708
Oh! Yes!

758
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,041
What the...

759
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,416
Ow!

760
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,791
Oh!

761
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,416
- Paul?
- Maddie! What the hell?

762
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,750
I'm sorry! I was asleep!

763
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:09,875
God, that hurts.

764
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:13,291
I didn't... It was a knee-jerk reaction.
Did I get you in the eye?

765
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:15,875
You got a bit more than the eye.

766
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:18,000
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

767
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,708
Don't... Don't touch me.

768
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,166
- Okay.
- Okay?

769
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,750
- Yeah.
- Oh.

770
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:28,416
I'm so sorry.

771
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:34,125
Are you sure you're okay?

772
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:37,041
- Oh, I'm tickety-boo.
- . Okay.

773
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:48,583
- You're doing a grand job, mate.
- Thank you.

774
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,208
Ah. Morning.

775
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,208
Where's Paul?

776
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,791
Uh, he's not coming.

777
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:55,791
Well, why not?

778
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,583
He had a little late-night injury.

779
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:59,250
He said we should scout locations.

780
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:02,416
- Nothing serious, I hope?
- Oh, no, he just needs the ice.

781
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:06,458
- What about your friends?
- Uh, they're getting mani-pedis.

782
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:10,458
Ready?

783
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:30,500
So how did you become an editor?

784
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:34,916
Oh, well, I was a freelance writer,
but that wasn't really paying the bills.

785
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,083
- Then I got a job at the publishing house.
- Ah, so that's how you met Paul.

786
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:41,791
Yeah. He wasn't really clicking
with any of the other editors,

787
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:44,416
and we were a good fit right off the bat.

788
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:46,375
That's interesting.

789
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:48,833
What does that mean?

790
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:51,416
I guess opposites attract.

791
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,625
Excuse me, Paul and I are not opposites.
We have many things in common.

792
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,541
I stand corrected.
I'm sure it's a long list of mutualities.

793
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:05,000
Why don't we stay silent for a second?
That way I can enjoy the view.

794
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:06,916
As you wish.

795
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:27,541
{\an8}DES MOINES,
IOWA

796
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,875
- How about you?
- We don't need to talk about me.

797
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,000
- Nice view though.
- Where are we going?

798
00:41:57,083 --> 00:42:00,125
- This is so pretty.
- Oh, it gets better. Come on.

799
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:06,958
So... I've got to ask.

800
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,583
Do you have to?

801
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:10,375
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

802
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:13,375
Why don't you write your own book?

803
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:16,583
I've been trying,

804
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:19,250
but it's been a bit difficult lately.

805
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:22,083
Because you're too busy
working on Paul's book.

806
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:24,041
No, I just...

807
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:28,833
- I'm not sure I have anything to say now.
- Everyone has something to say.

808
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,708
They just have to be
brave enough to say it.

809
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:34,750
- Are you calling me a coward?
- Absolutely not.

810
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:38,541
- You came up with that all by yourself.
- Okay.

811
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:46,333
Right. Well, Paul said
he wanted some authentic Ireland.

812
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:49,875
So, this is about as authentic as it gets.

813
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:54,125
Wow.

814
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,375
It's the Cliffs of Moher.

815
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,791
- You know it?
- I've heard about it.

816
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,916
What do you think?

817
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,541
I think I just stepped
into a James Joyce novel.

818
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:11,166
That's not the reference I was expecting.

819
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,625
Joyce is my favorite author.

820
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,291
Is he?

821
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:16,791
Hmm.

822
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:20,541
Hey, you're pretty good.

823
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,041
Thank you.

824
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,666
Unfortunately, I don't think
a rugged cliff is Paul's style.

825
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,750
No. No, probably not.

826
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,708
But is it yours?

827
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:34,333
- Yeah, I think it's beautiful here.
- Yeah, me too.

828
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:37,458
I'd love to get married up here.

829
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:39,583
Why don't you?

830
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:44,000
Because the wedding is this weekend,
and I don't want to be difficult.

831
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:47,125
I'd hardly call having a voice
at your own wedding being difficult.

832
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:54,291
Sorry, I just like to know
a little bit about my subjects

833
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,250
before I photograph them, that's all.

834
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:59,083
I thought you didn't photograph people.

835
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:01,875
I'm willing to make an exception.

836
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,958
I just don't understand it.

837
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,208
Oh.

838
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,625
- Wow.
- That was awful.

839
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:30,166
This looks like fun.

840
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,291
Heather, Emma. Come meet my mate, Finn.

841
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:35,375
Hi, I'm also Paul's groomsman.
Nice to meet you.

842
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:37,416
Paul, what happened to you?

843
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,458
Well, it's a long story.

844
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:41,625
I'm trying to minimize the damage.

845
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:42,916
Look.

846
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,916
Do you think it'll show in the photos?

847
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,916
I have an amazing concealer
you can borrow.

848
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,083
That'd be great. Thanks.

849
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:53,583
Heather, I was talking to Kory
about the big wedding aisle walk.

850
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,125
Should we all practice,
so we can make a splashy entrance?

851
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:58,000
I've got my eye on you, Finn.

852
00:44:58,083 --> 00:45:01,625
- He's trying to steal my spotlight.
- I got moves, Paul. I ain't gonna lie.

853
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:06,666
Oh, no one could steal your spotlight.
Can I get you some more ice?

854
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:11,791
No, no, no. Stay here and entertain me.
Stop me feeling sorry for myself.

855
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,875
Are you always so thoughtful?

856
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,625
Not with everybody.

857
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,208
Lucky me.

858
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,583
There's a storm's coming.

859
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:30,416
We should probably get you back.
I'm sure you got lots to do.

860
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,000
Not really. Paul's mom
has already done everything.

861
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:36,833
Where's your mum in this whole equation?

862
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:40,333
In Des Moines, but she's flying in
for the rehearsal dinner tomorrow.

863
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:43,291
- I'm sure you'll be happy to see her.
- It'll be great to get her here.

864
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:46,833
She knows how to handle these situations.
It'll make everything easier.

865
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:49,541
- Should...
- Give me a hand with that. Yeah.

866
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:51,458
Just pull.

867
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:08,958
Holy mother of God!

868
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:13,333
- This is intense.
- You know what they say about Ireland?

869
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:16,625
If you don't like the weather,
just wait five minutes.

870
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:18,166
Mark Twain said that.

871
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:25,750
That is a really big tree.

872
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,250
Yeah, it is.

873
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:29,666
And this is the only road out.

874
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,583
- There has to be another way around it.
- If we had a Hummer.

875
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:36,375
I'll have to turn around. It's okay.
I know a lovely little pub we can go to.

876
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:37,500
Wait, really?

877
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:02,666
- Come on. Come on.
- Ah!

878
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,083
- Get under.
- Thank you.

879
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,000
Let's go.

880
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:08,583
It's a good pub, this. It'll be worth it.

881
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,458
Wow. This is a fun place.

882
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,916
They do the best
fish and chips in Ireland here.

883
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,726
- I thought you didn't like fish and chips.
- What makes you think that?

884
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,750
Well, you said...

885
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:26,125
Never mind.

886
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:29,791
James Thomas, you bastard.

887
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:31,833
O'Callaghan, you swine.

888
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,166
How are you, buddy?

889
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,666
Yeah. What brings you here?

890
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,666
Well, there's a tree down on the road,
so we're stuck.

891
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,416
Oh, right, I heard, yeah.

892
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,125
Seamus is gonna see to it
first thing in the morning.

893
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:45,708
But he's a little cabbaged now.

894
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:48,791
In that case,
we'll need two rooms for the night.

895
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:51,625
Whoa, wait, we can't spend the night here.

896
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:53,791
Well, do you fancy sleeping in the car?

897
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:58,166
Just give me a second.

898
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:02,423
<i>This is Paul Kennedy.
I can't get to the phone right now.</i>

899
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:04,625
- Who's that lovely creature?
- Calm down.

900
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:08,083
Don't tell me you finally convinced
some young lady you're worth a shake.

901
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:09,375
Hey, Paul, it's Maddie.

902
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:13,083
Uh, a tree fell down in the middle
of the road, and so we are stuck here.

903
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:16,083
Her name is Madeline Kelly,
and I'm photographing her wedding.

904
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:17,041
Ah.

905
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:19,000
- Her wedding, huh?
- Now, now.

906
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:22,541
Looks like I'll have to spend the night.
Call me when you get this.

907
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:26,208
Okay, I left a message.

908
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,791
Good. Let's eat.

909
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:30,000
- Ah, take a seat.
- Okay.

910
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:33,708
How about a couple of stouts?

911
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:38,125
Oh, can I have a white wine, please?
I don't really drink beer.

912
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:41,666
Ooh, I wouldn't say that too loud
around these parts.

913
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,166
You'd get locked up for treason.

914
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,041
- He seems great.
- Yeah, he's great.

915
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:50,625
Tom and I go a long way back.

916
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:53,958
I've been coming to Ireland
since I was a kid, so it holds a very...

917
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:56,166
special place in my heart.

918
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,375
Here's our latest. Hope you like it.

919
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:01,125
Is it true that you don't have a home?

920
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:06,000
This week it's a rented room
above Scruffy Murphy's.

921
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:08,125
After, I'll be on the road
traveling the world

922
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:10,375
with nothing but a camera and a passport.

923
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:12,541
<i> Different situations </i>

924
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:15,041
<i> Running through my mind </i>

925
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:17,500
Doesn't that get lonely after a while?

926
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:18,666
I mean, it's...

927
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,166
There's a freedom, having no ties.

928
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,916
<i> And I don't know if I'm crazy </i>

929
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:30,333
Well, maybe you haven't found that person
to spend the rest of your life with.

930
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:33,083
Like you did?

931
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:35,041
<i> I see a house upon a hill </i>

932
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:38,500
<i> With our names written on the deck </i>

933
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,166
Do you play darts?

934
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,166
Not recently.

935
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,625
Let's play now.

936
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:47,458
Here we go.

937
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:52,000
It's all about grip,
stance, and confidence.

938
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:56,833
- You don't like to talk about yourself.
- What makes you say that?

939
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:58,500
You keep changing the subject.

940
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,333
You're supposed
to keep your feet on the floor.

941
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:06,166
You see what I mean?

942
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:11,083
This time, just try your stance like this.

943
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,541
Only your arm moves.

944
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,750
You're a man of mystery.

945
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:19,791
If you keep talking,
you won't visualize hitting the target.

946
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,208
- That was sneaky.
- I'm not sneaky.

947
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:27,083
Maybe it's the luck of the Irish then.

948
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:28,583
Or maybe it's just you.

949
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:33,625
- I mean, you're a good coach.
- Well, you're a good student.

950
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:39,000
I'm getting married in two days.

951
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:40,958
Right.

952
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,208
- Your drinks.
- Oh.

953
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:51,583
And your rooms.

954
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:53,875
- Lovely. Thanks, Tom.
- Enjoy.

955
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:56,625
Thank you.

956
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:59,375
- You want to try it?
- Uh, sure.

957
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,750
Not bad.

958
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:12,916
- One dance before we call it a night.
- Okay.

959
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:18,250
I'm sorry. I need to get by here.

960
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:21,166
It's a family emergency.
I got to go. Please. Please.

961
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,875
Yeah, you're done. You're done.

962
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,666
Thank you. Bye.

963
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:28,583
Hi, I've been standing in line
all this time at the wrong counter,

964
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:29,916
and I've missed my flight.

965
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,041
So I need you to get me
another one immediately.

966
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:35,333
Principal Kelly. It's me, Allegra.

967
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,583
- Oh. Yes, hello, Allegra.
- Hi.

968
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:41,500
Well, I need to get to Ireland.
My daughter's getting married.

969
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:44,375
- Maddie's getting married?
- Yes. I'm pressed for time.

970
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:48,041
I missed my flight to Dublin.
So see if you can you find me another one.

971
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:51,708
Then I need a connection to Knock airport.
That's in West Ireland.

972
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:54,458
Sure. How did you miss your plane?

973
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:57,750
A clock malfunction.

974
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:00,375
You overslept. That's crazy.

975
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:04,958
There was a power outage,
and my backup phone alarm just...

976
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:09,333
- What are you doing?
- I'm texting Kimmy.

977
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:11,708
Remember her from detention?
She's gonna freak out.

978
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:13,000
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

979
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:15,625
Somebody help me.

980
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:16,916
Please, help me!

981
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:38,958
Let's go.

982
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:03,583
Hey!

983
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,208
WILD HEN INN

984
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,750
Come on, please start. Please.

985
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:27,666
Mm-hmm.

986
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,458
Nope, nothing.

987
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:32,458
I can't believe this. I'm gonna be late
for my own wedding rehearsal.

988
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:34,458
Could be water in the carburetor.

989
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:37,083
- We could try a rolling jump.
- What's that?

990
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:39,583
You two push. I spring the clutch.

991
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:41,916
- Sure. Okay.
- Yeah, great.

992
00:53:46,791 --> 00:53:48,375
All right, ready?

993
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,875
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay!

994
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,333
Push!

995
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:58,750
Whoa!

996
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,500
Success!

997
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,041
Ah, crap.

998
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:08,625
I'll get a rag.

999
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:10,791
That'll do. A rag.

1000
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,208
Well, no sign of Madeline.

1001
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:19,125
First, her mother misses the flight,

1002
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:21,416
and now here we are
waiting for the daughter.

1003
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,916
- I hope this isn't a family trait.
- You couldn't make it up.

1004
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,960
I'm sure Maddie will be here any minute.

1005
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,166
I mean, those trees
can be a huge challenge,

1006
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:32,333
and we don't even know
if they had a chain saw, right, Em?

1007
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:33,750
Yeah, right.

1008
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,458
I can't believe
you didn't bring a phone charger.

1009
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:43,333
Neither did you.

1010
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:45,083
Does this car go any faster?

1011
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,458
- No.
- Great.

1012
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:54,708
- It's not funny.
- It's pretty funny. It'll be fine. Look.

1013
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,791
Look at that.

1014
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:04,791
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today

1015
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:10,000
to celebrate the love
of these two fine, young people who...

1016
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:13,041
Hold on, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

1017
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:16,416
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.

1018
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,666
Close call, Maddie.
You almost lost your place.

1019
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:19,916
Come here. Come here.

1020
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:22,125
Oh. Sorry.

1021
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:25,041
- What happened to you?
- Well...

1022
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:27,208
Uh, I'm afraid I'm to blame.

1023
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:29,833
We were coming back
from the Cliffs of Moher.

1024
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:32,166
What were you doing in that tourist trap?

1025
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:34,041
How did you get all muddy?

1026
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:37,666
Well, we're all together now,
and that's what matters.

1027
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,250
Mind if we cut to the chase?

1028
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,813
We have guests are arriving
at the rehearsal dinner in an hour.

1029
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:44,958
All right then,
let's skip to the good part.

1030
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,875
You may now kiss the bride.

1031
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:48,375
- Aw!
- Aw!

1032
00:55:58,875 --> 00:55:59,875
James?

1033
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:01,583
What?

1034
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:03,250
Who's James?

1035
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:07,375
That'd be me.

1036
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:10,125
What happened?

1037
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:12,125
Well, you fainted.

1038
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:16,625
It's her.

1039
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:18,958
It's who?

1040
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,375
Saint Brigid?

1041
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,416
She's the one who made all this happen.

1042
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,083
- Do you think she's been at the whiskey?
- Sean, please.

1043
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:28,101
- Must be the stress of the wedding.
- Need water?

1044
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:31,875
No, I'm just, uh...
I just feel a little dizzy, that's all.

1045
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:35,625
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, of course I'm okay.

1046
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:37,833
I'm marrying Paul Kennedy.

1047
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:39,291
That's right.

1048
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:41,916
Shall we continue?

1049
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,583
Of course, Father. Sorry.

1050
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:45,583
Where were we?

1051
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:54,541
Quieten down, everyone.

1052
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:57,541
My darling husband, Sean, has the floor.

1053
00:56:58,875 --> 00:56:59,916
Thank you, darling.

1054
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:03,458
May your hearts be light and happy.

1055
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:06,208
May your smiles be big and wide.

1056
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:10,541
And may your pockets
always have a coin or two inside.

1057
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:13,833
No worries there, Maddie.
You're marrying a Kennedy.

1058
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:17,583
- Sláinte!
- Sláinte!

1059
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:23,291
- You're drinking Guinness now, Maddie?
- I'm acquiring a taste for it.

1060
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:26,208
All right, now in honor
of the happy couple,

1061
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:29,666
we're gonna play a game
of "How Well Do You Know Your Fiancé?"

1062
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,250
Oh!

1063
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:35,625
Three questions. If you get them right,
you both take a shot.

1064
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:36,541
Mm-hmm.

1065
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:39,458
If you get them wrong,
we all have to drink a shot.

1066
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:44,500
We have to drink no matter what?
Can we play a different game?

1067
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:48,166
Oh, no, you're not getting out of this.
Kory's making the rules.

1068
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:53,208
All right, first question.
Who is Maddie's favorite author?

1069
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:55,208
Oh, that's an easy one.

1070
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:57,333
Paul Kennedy.

1071
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,291
No. Very good. Very good, no.

1072
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:05,291
No, my fiancée likes the classics.
Her favorite author is...

1073
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:06,958
James Joyce.

1074
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:08,208
...Charles Dickens.

1075
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,791
That's right.

1076
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:11,916
Hey!

1077
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:17,041
One point for the happy couple.

1078
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:21,583
Question two. What is the song
you first danced to together?

1079
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,125
Ooh.

1080
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:26,250
- Well, there wasn't one.
- Mm!

1081
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:29,916
Maddie doesn't know how to dance, do you?

1082
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,708
Nope.

1083
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:36,791
We've heard enough from you, brother.
Last question is for you, Maddie.

1084
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:40,416
Where did Paul propose to you?

1085
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,000
- She knows that answer.
- Tell us anyway.

1086
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:44,500
- Propose?
- Yeah.

1087
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:46,708
You know, how'd you get
the ring on your finger?

1088
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:48,541
Well, go on, Maddie. Tell them.

1089
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:57,666
Well, it was in this really special place.

1090
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,791
Really special.

1091
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:02,333
It was so, so special and...

1092
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:07,708
Right, wasn't it?
It was really beautiful and special.

1093
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:11,125
It was at O'Toole's in Brooklyn
on my birthday.

1094
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:12,208
Exactly.

1095
00:59:12,291 --> 00:59:13,500
Ah.

1096
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:17,125
- It was. It was at O'Toole's in Brooklyn.
- Mm-hmm.

1097
00:59:17,208 --> 00:59:18,916
- On your birthday.
- On my birthday.

1098
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And then...

1099
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:22,750
Well, and then Maddie looked at me,

1100
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:27,250
and she said, "What would it take
for you to bring me to Ireland?"

1101
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:29,125
And I said,

1102
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,625
"We'd have to be getting married."

1103
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,041
And then...

1104
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:37,708
Then...

1105
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:46,541
Oh, she's only messing.

1106
00:59:49,416 --> 00:59:52,625
Then you got down on your knee,
and you proposed to me.

1107
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:54,208
I proposed?

1108
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:57,416
I mean, yes, of course.
Yes, I proposed. Me.

1109
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,750
- I. Yes, I proposed.
- You.

1110
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:02,916
And the rest, as they say, is history.

1111
01:00:10,916 --> 01:00:12,708
<i> Hey, hey, hey </i>

1112
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:16,375
<i> Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember </i>

1113
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:20,333
<i> Ba-dee-ya, dancing in September? </i>

1114
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,708
- You all right? What's the matter?
- Foot's hurting.

1115
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:23,791
Come on.

1116
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:31,875
Excuse me.

1117
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:34,916
James, I thought
I might take a look at those.

1118
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:38,916
I think it might be better
if you stay tonight.

1119
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,666
I've asked Nevin
to make up the tower suite for you.

1120
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:42,833
Nevin. Lovely.

1121
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:44,596
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Fantastic.

1122
01:00:44,666 --> 01:00:48,166
- Thank you for today.
- Of course. Thank you for having me.

1123
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,416
It's been lovely.

1124
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:52,083
<i> Remember </i>

1125
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:55,875
<i> How we knew love was here to stay </i>

1126
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:59,083
<i> Now December </i>

1127
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:03,333
<i> Found the love we shared in September </i>

1128
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:06,041
<i> Only blue talk and love, remember </i>

1129
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,083
Are you leaving already?

1130
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:15,541
No, no, no. Just packing up
my stuff for the night.

1131
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:19,208
Olivia has me staying
in their guest tower.

1132
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:20,458
Sounds very posh.

1133
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:25,333
I don't think she trusts me to make it
on time tomorrow after the tree incident.

1134
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:26,416
- Mm.
- Yeah.

1135
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:30,791
Thank you for taking me
to see the Cliffs, and for the dance.

1136
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:33,833
I'd like to think of myself
as a full-service photographer.

1137
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,583
Is it everything you imagined?

1138
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:48,708
- What?
- This.

1139
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:51,625
All of this.

1140
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:56,416
You seemed confused in there,
like you and Paul didn't know each other.

1141
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,583
That's ridiculous.
Of course we know each other.

1142
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:01,875
- Charles Dickens?
- Anybody can make a mistake.

1143
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:02,958
Yeah.

1144
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:06,833
I hope you're not making one too.

1145
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:09,458
You don't get to say that to me.

1146
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:13,125
We barely know each other.
We spent a day together.

1147
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:16,083
I admit it was a beautiful day

1148
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:18,875
filled with dramatic vistas
and romantic rain,

1149
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:22,375
but that doesn't give you the right
to question my life choices.

1150
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:25,916
Tomorrow, I'm marrying Paul Kennedy.

1151
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:29,208
Because you asked him.

1152
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,875
Wait, so... so what? You don't think
a woman can ask a man to marry her?

1153
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:34,958
Of course not.

1154
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:37,833
But if you were my girlfriend,
I wouldn't have waited.

1155
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:41,000
I'd have asked you first.

1156
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:45,250
You know what?
Maybe you shouldn't come to the wedding.

1157
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:46,458
I'll tell Olivia then.

1158
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:49,541
- Fine. Take the photos.
- Fine. It'll be the last you see of me.

1159
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:52,708
After this job, I'm off to Bolivia
to photograph an endangered tree lizard.

1160
01:02:52,791 --> 01:02:55,458
- What? When do you leave?
- Sunday.

1161
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:58,583
Great. Right on time
to keep running from your own life.

1162
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:02,416
I shouldn't have said that.

1163
01:03:03,625 --> 01:03:04,791
A bit late.

1164
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:15,958
Mom?

1165
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:18,666
- I got a flight. We're about to board.
<i>- You did?</i>

1166
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:21,208
- That is great news.
- I'll be there in time for the wedding.

1167
01:03:21,291 --> 01:03:23,125
But don't pick me up. I'll take a taxi.

1168
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:25,125
Okay. Mom, I'm so happy you're coming.

1169
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:28,083
- I really need to see you.
<i>- I'll be there soon.</i>

1170
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:31,041
<i>I'll make sure your wedding to Paul
is absolutely perfect.</i>

1171
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:32,208
<i>Thank you, Mom.</i>

1172
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:36,291
<i>Gate change announcement.
Flight 47 to Dublin will now...</i>

1173
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:39,208
What did they just say?
Hold on one sec, honey.

1174
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:41,708
Where's everyone going? What's happening?

1175
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:44,458
<i>- I gotta go. Bye.</i>
- Mom? Mom?

1176
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:49,791
Coming through. Coming through.

1177
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:52,708
Oh.

1178
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:53,708
Ah!

1179
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:03,833
<i> Goody two, goody two
Goody goody two shoes </i>

1180
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:06,416
<i> Goody two, goody two
Goody goody two shoes </i>

1181
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,666
<i> Don't drink, don't smoke
What do you do? </i>

1182
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,166
<i> Don't drink, don't smoke </i>

1183
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,250
<i> What do you do? </i>

1184
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:15,375
<i> There must be something inside </i>

1185
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:16,833
Phew! Hi.

1186
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:19,833
Hi. Uh, looks like you're having fun.

1187
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:21,625
Emma's a good dancer, huh?

1188
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:25,000
Yeah. Hey, maybe she can give you
a few pointers for tomorrow.

1189
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:29,875
Oh, I almost forgot. I wrote our vows.
I emailed them to you.

1190
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:32,875
Wait, uh, you wrote my wedding vows?

1191
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:34,916
Maddie, I am a writer.

1192
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,291
But maybe you can
spruce them up a bit, huh?

1193
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,750
Paul, can you come here for a sec?

1194
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:43,791
Oh. I'm being summoned. You coming?

1195
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:46,750
You know, I think
I'm gonna head to bed if that's okay.

1196
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:47,833
I'm pretty beat.

1197
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:50,458
Okay, well, I'm staying
in the guest room tonight.

1198
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:52,583
Wouldn't want any bad luck
before the wedding.

1199
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:54,750
No. Wouldn't want that.

1200
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:56,250
- Good night.
- Good night.

HERE YOU GO BABE!
WEDDING VOWS BY PAUL KENNEDY

1205
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:05,333
- This was an amazing night.
- It was.

1206
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,625
Yes. I wish it could have gone on forever.

1207
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:10,375
Yeah, me too.

1208
01:06:13,125 --> 01:06:14,833
- Good night.
- Good night.

1209
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:48,000
Those flowers go in the chapel.

1210
01:06:49,166 --> 01:06:50,916
A perfect morning for a wedding.

1211
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,250
Did you get a good shot?

1212
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:13,541
I think so. Yeah.

1213
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:18,333
Um, haven't you got
a wedding to get ready for?

1214
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:21,791
Yeah, I'm just taking a moment.

1215
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:25,541
I'll leave you to it.

1216
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:30,083
James. I'm really sorry about last night.

1217
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,416
No apologies necessary.

1218
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:38,125
You've had a lot going on.

1219
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:44,166
- I read your book.
- You mean Paul's book.

1220
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:45,666
I know what I said.

1221
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,416
It's better than his other books.

1222
01:07:48,541 --> 01:07:49,666
A lot better.

1223
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,250
Wonder how that happened.

1224
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:54,000
I didn't change all that much.

1225
01:07:55,083 --> 01:07:57,166
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

1226
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,750
It's one thing to edit a book,

1227
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:01,083
but you shouldn't
go on editing your own life.

1228
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:06,375
I'm not editing my own life, I just...

1229
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,291
I know this might sound strange,

1230
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,333
but I'm not sure
this is supposed to be my life.

1231
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:14,041
If that's the case,
then now is the time to speak up.

1232
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:18,375
Is this what you really want, Maddie?

1233
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:24,125
Is Paul really the person you want
to share the rest of your life with?

1234
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:28,583
Marrying Paul is my wish come true.

1235
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:32,541
Okay.

1236
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:35,875
Then why are you so sad?

1237
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:32,625
Right this way.

1238
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:50,875
Your veil is spectacular.
You look amazing.

1239
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:53,875
Well, this is it.
I can't believe it's all happening.

1240
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:57,791
Me neither. Can you do me a favor
and see if my mom's arrived?

1241
01:09:57,875 --> 01:10:00,355
- She's not answering her phone.
- Yeah, absolutely. I'm on it.

1242
01:10:00,416 --> 01:10:02,000
Okay, thank you.

1243
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:04,625
Hi, Father.

1244
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:06,875
Are you ready, Madeline?

1245
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:09,041
Uh, I guess so.

1246
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:11,541
- You guess?
- I'm just...

1247
01:10:12,916 --> 01:10:15,416
Father, I think I've done something wrong.

1248
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,666
What is it, my dear?

1249
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:21,000
I made a wish to Saint Brigid.

1250
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:21,958
Oh!

1251
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,041
Is that all?

1252
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:25,458
You have to be careful with that one.

1253
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:27,791
She's known to have
a bit of a sense of humor.

1254
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:30,166
Oh. What does that mean?

1255
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:34,375
Well, when you ask her for something,
she may not give you what you want,

1256
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:38,500
but she'll always give you what you need.

1257
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,958
Oh, that's my cue.

1258
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:45,041
It's all going to work out just fine.
I'll see you out there.

1259
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:47,125
Oh!

1260
01:10:47,916 --> 01:10:49,750
Oh! It's starting.

1261
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:52,125
Ah! Are my eyebrows even?

1262
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:55,208
That makeup artist Olivia hired
has serious 'tude.

1263
01:10:55,291 --> 01:10:57,375
- And I think I pissed her off.
- You look great.

1264
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:58,500
Mm...

1265
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:02,666
- I'm sorry, Em.
- Hmm?

1266
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:04,208
About what?

1267
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:05,458
You and Paul.

1268
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:10,291
What are you talking about?

1269
01:11:12,791 --> 01:11:15,125
I know you two
have feelings for each other.

1270
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:17,958
I saw you on the patio last night.

1271
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,708
Nothing happened.

1272
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:22,708
I've known you since we were kids, Em.

1273
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:25,416
It's all right. You can tell me.

1274
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:27,750
Maddie.

1275
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,291
Do you believe in fate?

1276
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:33,500
Sometimes.

1277
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:35,500
See, I don't know why,

1278
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,208
but from the moment I met Paul,

1279
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:42,083
it just... it just felt like
we were supposed to be together.

1280
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:46,375
In another life, maybe we would have been.

1281
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:49,083
Just not this one.

1282
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,416
I can't believe
you're taking this so well.

1283
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,291
This is your big day, and I'm ruining it.

1284
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:02,875
It's not your fault. Really.

1285
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:07,083
I'm gonna try to make things right.

1286
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:24,333
Ah.

1287
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:19,500
Excuse me.

1288
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:21,458
- Hi.
- Stop, stop, stop.

1289
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:24,333
- Hello.
- Is that the dress?

1290
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:28,000
- What's going on?
- Oh, dear.

1291
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:31,416
What's she wearing?
Where's the family wedding dress?

1292
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,500
Hi, there.

1293
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,416
Um, for those of you who don't know me,
I'm Maddie.

1294
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,250
The bride.

1295
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:49,875
Or at least I was supposed to be.

1296
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,875
Of course, uh, you know Paul.

1297
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:57,125
He's a really great guy,
and a good writer too.

1298
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:58,958
Um...

1299
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:02,625
People often tell me
that I need to speak up for myself.

1300
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:05,500
So, here it goes.

1301
01:14:07,916 --> 01:14:09,541
I really care about Paul...

1302
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:12,625
...but I'm not in love with him.

1303
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:16,500
And I'm pretty sure
he feels the same way about me.

1304
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:17,666
Maddie.

1305
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:19,750
I just think

1306
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,333
that if you're gonna go through
with something like this,

1307
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:27,166
like a wedding,
and a marriage, and a life,

1308
01:14:27,916 --> 01:14:32,000
that it should be with someone you love,
not just someone you wish for.

1309
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:35,750
It should be with someone you find,

1310
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:39,083
or even someone who finds you.

1311
01:14:44,166 --> 01:14:46,958
I'm sorry. This is unacceptable!

1312
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:49,708
Paul, how did you let this happen?

1313
01:14:50,208 --> 01:14:51,208
Me?

1314
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:53,625
It's all his fault.

1315
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:57,125
- The photographer?
- I saw you with Maddie this morning.

1316
01:14:57,208 --> 01:14:58,458
At the lily pond.

1317
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:01,958
Wait, what about you and Emma
last night on the patio?

1318
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:05,500
Oh, that's irrelevant.
This joker is trying to steal my bride.

1319
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:08,750
At least I'm not stealing Maddie's ideas
and calling them my own.

1320
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:12,045
- What are you talking about?
- Your latest book.

1321
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:13,458
Well.

1322
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:16,041
Wha...?

1323
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:17,208
I wrote that book.

1324
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:18,333
Hmm.

1325
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:20,583
No, you didn't. I wrote that book.

1326
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:24,708
And there you have it.

1327
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:26,208
Paul, stop.

1328
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:30,041
No. You're right. You're right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.

1329
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,125
Come here!

1330
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:34,541
No! Stop. Let go of him.

1331
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:36,333
Maddie, this is not helping.

1332
01:15:37,958 --> 01:15:39,291
Paul, stop it!

1333
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,375
- My leg.
- Oh!

1334
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,041
Oh!

1335
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:56,083
Sean, don't just stand there!
Do something!

1336
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:58,541
Come on, son. You got this.

1337
01:15:58,625 --> 01:16:00,208
- Steady does you.
- Who's that?

1338
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:05,208
- Leave my brother alone!
- Mom? Where are you?

1339
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:08,625
Don't panic,
but I am in the hospital in Des Moines.

1340
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:10,750
- What? Are you all right?
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

1341
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,041
I've just got a fracture of the metatarsal

1342
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:16,166
and a little bump on the head,
but I remember everything now.

1343
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,291
Honey, tell me. The wedding.
Was it everything you ever dreamt of?

1344
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:22,583
Kory!

1345
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:24,083
Not in a million years.

1346
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:27,416
Why are you not getting him? Help me!
Help me get him.

1347
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:29,958
Get off my foot! Get off!

1348
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,916
What's wrong with you? What?

1349
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,875
Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back.

1350
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:36,958
James!

1351
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:38,875
Who are you helping?

1352
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:41,541
Paul. Are you hurt?

1353
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:44,708
No, I don't think so.

1354
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,416
I can't believe you called me irrelevant.

1355
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,791
What?

1356
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:54,458
I didn't mean it like that.
I'm sorry! Come back!

1357
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:56,166
Oh my God.

1358
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,916
Let's keep him out of this.

1359
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
James.

1360
01:17:02,791 --> 01:17:04,416
Wait, James.

1361
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,000
I made a mistake.

1362
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:12,500
I shouldn't have stayed on this job.
I've become too emotionally involved.

1363
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:14,875
- You have?
- You heard Paul in there.

1364
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:19,708
He thinks I'm responsible for all this,
and if I'm being honest, I probably am.

1365
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:21,000
You're not.

1366
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:27,041
If I ever made you doubt yourself,
then I am truly sorry.

1367
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:29,250
- But...
- The best thing I can do is just...

1368
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:31,583
walk away from you.

1369
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:34,250
But none of this is your fault.

1370
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:37,958
I really wish you
all the happiness in the world.

1371
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:40,916
I can't be happy without you.

1372
01:17:41,916 --> 01:17:44,250
I know this doesn't make sense right now,

1373
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:46,708
but I believe in my heart
that we're meant to be together.

1374
01:17:49,416 --> 01:17:50,416
Not like this.

1375
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:54,541
James, stop!

1376
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:20,416
Goodbye, Maddie.

1377
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:12,291
Okay, I'm here!

1378
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,250
Oh.

1379
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:18,250
I know you're here, Saint Brigid.
You can come out now!

1380
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:21,083
Please! This was all a mistake.

1381
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:24,125
Paul, the wedding, James.

1382
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:25,916
Just take it back!

1383
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:29,791
Saint Brigid!

1384
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:31,791
There's no need to shout, dear.

1385
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:33,000
I'm right here.

1386
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:36,208
I need to unwish my wish.

1387
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:37,333
Oh.

1388
01:19:37,958 --> 01:19:42,000
I'm afraid that's impossible.
That wish has already been granted.

1389
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:44,000
But everything has gone horribly wrong.

1390
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:47,750
Has it? Or has it gone exactly
as it was supposed to?

1391
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:50,416
No, you're right,
and I've learned my lesson.

1392
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,333
I have to live my own destiny.

1393
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:55,208
Well, then, that's different.

1394
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,416
Wait, come back. Where are you going?

1395
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:05,791
Please, Saint Brigid,
let me unwish my wish!

1396
01:20:06,708 --> 01:20:07,750
Oh!

1397
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:08,875
Okay.

1398
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:11,708
Okay. I can do this.

1399
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:16,041
I just need a little wind.

1400
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:18,958
Where's the wind? Okay.

1401
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:23,708
Okay, just a little breeze.
Give me something.

1402
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:26,583
I'll take anything you got. Okay.

1403
01:20:28,041 --> 01:20:30,708
Just take back my wish!

1404
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:00,875
Is anybody in here?

1405
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:16,666
- Oh!
- Ah!

1406
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,833
What are you doing?

1407
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:21,583
- Why aren't you dressed?
- That's a bridesmaid's dress.

1408
01:21:21,666 --> 01:21:24,458
Uh, yes, and it's supposed to be
on the bridesmaid.

1409
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:26,958
- The ring is gone.
- What ring?

1410
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:28,416
That's Paul and Emma.

1411
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:29,500
Oh.

1412
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:30,708
Is everything okay?

1413
01:21:30,791 --> 01:21:33,083
This is amazing! Ah!

1414
01:21:33,166 --> 01:21:35,083
I'm glad you think so.

1415
01:21:35,166 --> 01:21:36,250
Let's get moving.

1416
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:38,500
Oh.

1417
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,401
- Hi, Mom.
<i>- Sweetheart.</i>

1418
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:42,458
Oh, how's your foot?

1419
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:45,583
My foot? Oh, you mean my arthritis.

1420
01:21:45,666 --> 01:21:48,833
Oh, that hasn't acted up
since I've been using that glucosamine.

1421
01:21:49,666 --> 01:21:51,708
- That is such good news!
<i>- Aw.</i>

1422
01:21:52,291 --> 01:21:53,375
Thank you, honey.

1423
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:58,291
Yay!

1424
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:16,541
James?

1425
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:19,000
Oh, sorry.

1426
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:28,416
Right.

1427
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,250
Right. Here we go.

1428
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:35,041
Hey!

1429
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:40,625
<i> Put on your red shoes </i>

1430
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:41,708
Thank you.

1431
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:43,833
Whiskey, please.

1432
01:22:43,916 --> 01:22:45,791
- Great reception.
- Yeah.

1433
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:47,541
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1434
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:48,791
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1435
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:50,875
<i>...playing on the radio </i>

1436
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:54,601
Okay, fine. He's not into me.

1437
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,500
I'm moving on.

1438
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:57,875
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

1439
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,208
Champagne, please.

1440
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:03,833
- Well, hello, handsome.
- Hi.

1441
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:05,500
- Fancy a dance?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

1442
01:23:05,583 --> 01:23:07,000
All right. Say less.

1443
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:08,958
Yeah.

1444
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:13,583
<i> If you say run </i>

1445
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:15,791
- Hey.
- Hey, having fun?

1446
01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:19,416
Yeah, it was a beautiful ceremony.
And you got to wear your own dress.

1447
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,166
Wouldn't have happened without you.

1448
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:24,500
Look, Maddie, I spent my whole life
looking for someone like Paul.

1449
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:25,875
I couldn't be happier for you.

1450
01:23:25,958 --> 01:23:28,625
Oh, there's the photographer.
Is my lipstick still on?

1451
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:29,875
It's perfect.

1452
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,333
<i>...break my heart in two </i>

1453
01:23:33,416 --> 01:23:35,125
<i> Ah </i>

1454
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:39,333
<i> If you should fall into my arms </i>

1455
01:23:39,416 --> 01:23:42,833
<i> And tremble like a flower </i>

1456
01:23:42,916 --> 01:23:44,291
There's my girl.

1457
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:48,000
Congratulations, Paul.
Emma is an incredible person.

1458
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:50,000
- You're lucky to have her.
- We're all lucky.

1459
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:52,125
I just got off the phone
with the publisher.

1460
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:54,125
The US numbers are huge.

1461
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:56,291
They want a sequel right away.

1462
01:23:56,375 --> 01:23:59,125
Now obviously, I'm going
on my honeymoon for a month,

1463
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:01,125
so do you mind
starting the story without me?

1464
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:03,250
That depends.

1465
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:04,750
On what?

1466
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:06,916
Am I gonna get co-writing credit?

1467
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:12,958
Madeline, that's not how it works.

1468
01:24:13,041 --> 01:24:14,375
I get the sole credit.

1469
01:24:14,458 --> 01:24:16,541
You edit the story,

1470
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:18,708
and my name sells the books.

1471
01:24:18,791 --> 01:24:21,083
That's why we're a perfect team.

1472
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:22,000
Yeah.

1473
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:24,875
You know what, Paul?
That's not how a team works.

1474
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:27,333
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to fly solo on this one.

1475
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:32,291
Where are you going?

1476
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:35,875
To write my own story.

1477
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:43,750
Enjoy that.

1478
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:46,708
- Thank you, Murphy.
- Sláinte.

1479
01:24:49,916 --> 01:24:53,583
<i> So let me give you every... </i>

1480
01:24:54,291 --> 01:24:55,625
What can I get for you?

1481
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:58,875
Hi, I'm looking for James Thomas.
He's renting a room upstairs.

1482
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:01,916
James? He's left. You just missed him.

1483
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,375
Oh. I did?

1484
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:06,166
- Maybe you'll catch him.
- Okay, uh, thank you.

1485
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:08,041
- You're welcome.
- Thank you so much.

1486
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:12,250
<i> You don't know why I'd waste my time </i>

1487
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:15,166
<i> But I'm falling and I mean it </i>

1488
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,166
<i> I want you like I need it </i>

1489
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:21,333
<i> There's nothing you could try
To change my mind </i>

1490
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,708
Is this seat taken?

1491
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:25,416
<i> 'Cause I'm in love with you </i>

1492
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,291
Um, depends if you'll try
to steal my bag again.

1493
01:25:31,291 --> 01:25:32,750
- Thanks.
- It's okay.

1494
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,208
- Well, this is a coincidence.
- It's a small village.

1495
01:25:39,166 --> 01:25:42,250
- So you're a nature photographer, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1496
01:25:42,333 --> 01:25:45,083
I was wondering
if I could get your advice on something.

1497
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:46,916
All right.

1498
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,250
I'm doing some research
on the Bolivian tree lizard.

1499
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:51,875
They're endangered, you know.

1500
01:25:51,958 --> 01:25:54,791
I've just been offered a job
in Bolivia to photograph that lizard.

1501
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:58,416
- When are you leaving?
- Well, I'm not. I turned the job down.

1502
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,250
You did?

1503
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:03,541
Well, just after you got off that bus,

1504
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:06,375
I, uh, met this very interesting woman

1505
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:09,291
who encouraged me
to stick around for a while.

1506
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:11,041
See what might happen.

1507
01:26:12,916 --> 01:26:14,791
How long are you gonna be in Ireland for?

1508
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:17,458
As long as it takes.

1509
01:26:18,708 --> 01:26:21,375
I'm planning on writing
a book on the Cliffs of Moher.

1510
01:26:22,166 --> 01:26:23,375
Do you know them?

1511
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:25,875
One of my favorite spots.

1512
01:26:26,916 --> 01:26:27,916
Mine too.

1513
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:29,708
Huh.

1514
01:26:31,708 --> 01:26:33,875
Maybe we could go there together sometime.

1515
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:35,875
I'd like that.

1516
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,375
What's the book about?

1517
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:49,041
I have this crazy idea.

1518
01:26:58,833 --> 01:27:01,750
{\an8}- Fancy something to eat later?
- I'd love that.

1519
01:27:01,833 --> 01:27:03,713
{\an8}I know a lovely little pub we can go to.

1520
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,375
Can we play darts?

1521
01:27:05,458 --> 01:27:06,458
Absolutely.

1522
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:08,541
There's even live music.

1523
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:11,125
- Do you dance?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

1524
01:27:11,208 --> 01:27:12,458
I had a feeling.

1525
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:23,166
<i> Dreams in motion </i>

1526
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,500

<i> If we fall, we fall together </i>

1545
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:45,916

<i> And we'll love until we break </i>

1556
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:28,583
<i> And we'll take all we can take </i>

1557
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:30,500
<i> Building castles </i>

1558
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:35,708

<i> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh </i>

1564
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:58,625
<i> Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh </i>

1565
01:29:58,708 --> 01:30:02,416
<i> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh </i>
