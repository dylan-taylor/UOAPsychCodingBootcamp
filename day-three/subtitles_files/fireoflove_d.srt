1
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,800
In a cold world,
all the watches started to freeze.

2
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,640
The sun came and went between blizzards
and gusts which erased all bearings.

3
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,800
In this world lived a fire

4
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,520
and in this fire,
two lovers found a home.

5
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,080
All right.
The volcano is ready, waiting for us.

6
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Yes.

7
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Okay.

8
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,160
Katia?

9
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,160
This is Katia,
and this is Maurice.

10
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,040
It's 1991, June 2nd.

11
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,880
Tomorrow will be their last day.

12
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,520
They will leave behind samples.

13
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Words.

14
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,160
Hundreds of hours of footage.

15
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,920
Thousands of photos.

16
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,640
And a million questions.

17
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,720
The Muana Loa.

18
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,680
They meet 19 years ago.

19
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,680
In 1966.

20
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,120
There is no definitive account
of this first encounter

21
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,040
and the visual record
of their budding romance is sparse.

22
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,360
There is this photo...

23
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,040
and these rose-tinted moments
a few years later.

24
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,080
Parts of Katia and Maurice's story
remain lost to time.

25
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,000
As in love, there are mysteries.

26
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,160
You fall hard for what you know.

27
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,760
Harder for what you don't.

28
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,280
In one story, Katia
and Maurice meet by chance on a bench

29
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
at the University of Strasbourg.

30
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,240
In a second,

31
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,920
they meet at a new film
by renowned volcanologist Haroun Tazieff.

32
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,240
The most detailed account
is a blind date at a café.

33
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,400
They bond over their first loves,
Mount Etna and Mount Stromboli.

34
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,680
Katia, a rebel who was sent
to a school for unruly girls,

35
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,440
convinces her parents to take her
to Italy's volcanoes.

36
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,240
Maurice would return to Stromboli

37
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,680
at age 19,

38
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,400
feeling at once ecstasy and loneliness.

39
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,240
Katia understands
this loneliness.

40
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,600
It is also hers.

41
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,000
Growing up in the rubble
of postwar Alsace,

42
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,560
the world felt to them unsafe, uncertain.

43
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,160
They take refuge in the mysteries
of the natural world.

44
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,880
Dreaming,
just 20 kilometers apart.

45
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,480
The Vosges and Rhine fault lines
shifting imperceptibly beneath them.

46
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,240
At the end of this version,
the café closes and it begins to rain.

47
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,440
They will never
leave each other.

48
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,080
November 19th, 1967,

49
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,160
a U.S. fighter plane
drops two snake-eye bombs

50
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,320
along the South Vietnam border...

51
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,360
the territory once colonized
as French Indochina.

52
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,720
One week later,

53
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,360
Katia and Maurice join anti-war protests
in Paris.

54
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,840
The next day, they show up
on the front page of L'Humanité.

55
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,560
But human pursuits
of power begin to feel vain and absurd

56
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,480
next to the power of the Earth.

57
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,920
It's also
the plate tectonic revolution,

58
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,320
and the field of volcanology
is finding its form.

59
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,840
They devour
each hypothesis, each myth.

60
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,920
Everything that has been gleaned so far
from the archives of the Earth.

61
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,520
The truths...

62
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,920
the fragments...

63
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,520
the questions.

64
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,520
They wonder what forms
and re-forms the world.

65
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,640
To these mysteries they long
to get closer.

66
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,320
With just enough grant money
and a donated car,

67
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,120
Katia and Maurice
go seek Iceland's volcanoes

68
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,960
with their friend, Roland.

69
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,760
Katia is the geochemist,

70
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,040
Maurice the geologist.

71
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,640
Alone, they could only dream of volcanoes.

72
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,760
Together, they can reach them.

73
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,000
Except the car breaks down
27 times.

74
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,920
Then crashes.

75
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,800
And Maurice gets
into hot water.

76
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,120
Here is an actor
reading Katia's account.

77
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,080
Undeterred,
they spend the next few summers

78
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,960
studying their mutual friends,
Etna and Stromboli.

79
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,320
They also bring along more human friends.

80
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,760
L'Équipe Vulcain, they call themselves.

81
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,040
Katia and Maurice are after

82
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
the strange alchemy of elements,

83
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,000
the combination of mineral, heat,

84
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
gas and time that incites an eruption.

85
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,440
What is it, they ask,
that makes the Earth's heart beat?

86
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,560
Its blood flow?

87
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,680
They study, examine and question.

88
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,040
Katia and Maurice begin
to learn the secrets of the planet

89
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,040
that few others know.

90
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,720
Understanding
is love's other name.

91
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,560
1970,

92
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,800
Katia and Maurice marry
in a small ceremony in Alsace.

93
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,320
They honeymoon
on the volcanic island of Santorini,

94
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,280
believed to be the secret location
of Atlantis.

95
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,760
Katia and Maurice decide
they will not have children.

96
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,880
“From here on out,
life will only be volcanoes,

97
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,840
"volcanoes, volcanoes,” Maurice says.

98
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The young field of volcanology

99
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,160
has found two young stars.

100
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,960
The camera loves them.

101
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,360
And they love their own cameras back.

102
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,160
Photography
is a means of remembering, revisiting,

103
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,920
stretching their time with volcanoes.

104
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,560
This photo shows
the parabolic trajectories

105
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,280
of volcanic bombs ejected from Stromboli.

106
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,240
This one shows how lava
is stretched into glass wool

107
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,840
called Pele's hair.

108
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,240
And this shot helps visualize
plate tectonic theory.

109
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,800
Volcanology
is a science of observation.

110
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,000
The closer they get, the more they see.

111
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,680
The very instant
a volcano wakes up,

112
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,200
these weirdoes are notified

113
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,800
by a growing network of local friends
and guides who help them

114
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,120
reach the craters as fast
as humanly possible.

115
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,280
Maurice and Katia
make their expedition to Nyiragongo,

116
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,880
a volcano that sits
between two diverging plates.

117
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,760
They are guided by fellow
volcanologist Jacques Durieux.

118
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,320
You arrive
at the mouth of the volcano,

119
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,680
then you have to go

120
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,160
in the mouth of the volcano.
So you are going down.

121
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,240
Not so high, 300 meters.
But very bad rock.

122
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,200
All kinds of fumaroles went through,
and so it's not strong.

123
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,400
Here,
Maurice and Katia make their home

124
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,040
for the next two weeks.

125
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,360
Katia would later write...

126
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
Suddenly, the lava plunges down

127
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,480
ten meters in seconds.

128
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,960
Katia and Maurice
will eventually emerge

129
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,400
from this crater unscathed and emboldened.

130
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,400
In the immense universe

131
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,560
that is the classification of volcanoes,

132
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,680
the Kraffts will eventually
adopt two general classes.

133
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Red...

134
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,440
and gray.

135
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,240
Red volcanoes,
like Nyiragongo,

136
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,040
form as tectonic plates pull apart,

137
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,640
and at hotspots on the ocean floor.

138
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,880
Magma rises and fills in the gaps
opened up by the movement of the Earth,

139
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,000
creating new land.

140
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,560
Red volcanoes are basaltic.

141
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Effusive.

142
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,640
And up to 1200 degrees Celsius hot.

143
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,520
Katia and Maurice
have their differences.

144
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,440
Katia is like a bird.

145
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,480
Maurice, an elephant seal.

146
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,840
Katia is drawn to details,
the interconnectedness of things.

147
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,080
Maurice, the singular, the grandiose.

148
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,160
They both observe the world,
but in their own distinct ways.

149
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,040
Katia, with her still camera,
captures one moment with one frame.

150
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,120
Maurice chases motion...

151
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,640
recording a stream of seconds,
24 frames each.

152
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:16,560
He thirsts to get every possible shot,
because the spectacle could vanish.

153
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,760
But this causes him to wander...

154
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,720
and wander...

155
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,520
and wander.

156
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,000
Katia's greatest fear is
that she will lose sight of him...

157
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,840
and never see him again.

158
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,440
A surprise telegram
summons Katia...

159
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,920
and Maurice to Nyiragongo,

160
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,160
their beloved volcano
that they met four years ago.

161
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,720
Katia and Maurice knew

162
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,800
this kind of destruction was possible.

163
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,680
But this is the first time
they experience it firsthand.

164
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,400
The lava flows were going very...
very fast.

165
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,840
They were probably running
at 60 to 70 kilometers per hour.

166
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,320
And this was in the morning
where a lot of people were on the road

167
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,920
going for the market.

168
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,400
We think that around 100 people
were overwhelmed by the lava flow.

169
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,000
Very unusual eruption.

170
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,040
No amount of scientific research

171
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,240
could have prepared them for this shock.

172
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,720
The language of myth instead feels apt.

173
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,120
They're in the cauldron of the devil,

174
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,960
the portal to hell.

175
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,320
Or caught amid the warring spirits
of the volcano,

176
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,560
according to the stories
from their friends in Goma.

177
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,920
For Katia and Maurice,

178
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,080
the unknown is not something to be feared.

179
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,600
It is something to go toward.

180
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,120
At only 52 years old

181
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,880
an infant Indonesian volcano begins
to throw a fit.

182
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,880
Katia and Maurice go chase it.

183
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:29,320
In 1883, its parent,
a volcano named Krakatau, exploded.

184
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,200
It conjured a tsunami so forceful
that it swept

185
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,480
neighboring coastlines,
killing 36,417 people.

186
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,720
It also ripped up this coral
from the seafloor

187
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,760
and parked a colonial Dutch steamship
two miles inland.

188
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,000
Ash traveled the globe,
intensifying sunsets that transfixed

189
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,520
the gaze of scientists and artists,
especially one Norwegian painter

190
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,280
who described the sunsets as a scream.

191
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,760
Then the volcano
collapsed into the sea...

192
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,080
only to spring up again as a newcomer
called Anak Krakatau.

193
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,160
Katia and Maurice
must be totally in sync.

194
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,520
Any mistake that one makes can be costly
for the both of them.

195
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,920
But Maurice cannot do this work
without Katia.

196
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,080
Neither can Katia, without Maurice.

197
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,760
And together, they're there
for the volcano,

198
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,280
who is indifferent in the face
of their adulation.

199
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,880
Katia and Maurice know

200
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,120
that these rocks will long outlive them.

201
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,160
They are not religious.

202
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,120
"We are scientists," they say.

203
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,520
"We have but this one short life,
then we return to the ground."

204
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,440
With her one short life,
Katia dreams of growing old

205
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,960
with the volcano, of turning over
its every stone.

206
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:34,880
Maurice burns
to get closer to the fire, no matter what.

207
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,560
He once wrote,

208
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,240
Maurice hatches this plan

209
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,880
from another boating adventure

210
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,840
during their first trip
to Indonesia in 1971.

211
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,320
Here,
they study the largest reserve

212
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,440
of sulfuric acid in the world.

213
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,120
MAURICE: F

214
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,440
Suddenly,
the acid eats through the steel cable

215
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,400
and claims the sample bottle
at the bottom of the lake.

216
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,880
This mission is over.

217
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,640
A headwind sweeps them further from shore.

218
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,640
They will spend the next three hours
struggling to get back.

219
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,760
Katia is furious.

220
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,680
Over time, Maurice perfects

221
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,920
the legend of Maurice Krafft.

222
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,440
And together,

223
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,640
he and Katia
have gotten good at playing themselves.

224
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,680
Despite what Maurice says,

225
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,000
their footage suggests otherwise.

226
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,640
For instance, how do they show
that their work is grueling?

227
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,920
Perhaps like this?

228
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,040
Or this?

229
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,360
How do they show how to gaze
into the abyss?

230
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,360
Perhaps like this.

231
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,520
How do they stage geologic scale?

232
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,680
With images like this?

233
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,360
But what about this?

234
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,920
Why was this moment captured
with their rationed feet of film?

235
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,560
What or who was it for?

236
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:15,000
Now and again, Katia and Maurice
must go back to Alsace

237
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,400
to turn their photos and footage
into books and films.

238
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,040
Here, they are denizens
of this human world.

239
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,200
In order
to get back home to the volcano,

240
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,200
they must pay the bills.

241
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,560
Katia catalogues their images,

242
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,040
writes the books

243
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,480
and handles the logistics.

244
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,320
Maurice takes the lecture tour,
media appearances,

245
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,400
tries in vain to plan his lava canoe trip.

246
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,280
He also edits their films.

247
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,400
Ball is in.

248
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,200
Danger.

249
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,520
Danger.

250
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,280
Over in the United States,
volcanologist Harry Glicken

251
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,760
takes this photo of Mount St. Helens
on May 17, 1980.

252
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,240
What follows are some
of the best-known images

253
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,120
of what will happen here tomorrow,

254
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:52,520
starting at eight hours, 32 minutes,
11.4 seconds Pacific Daylight Time.

255
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,000
Fifty-three kilometers
to the east on Mount Adams,

256
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,200
a hiker takes these photos.

257
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,440
Fifty-six kilometers
to the northwest,

258
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,400
this image is taken.

259
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,760
Somewhere further, an eight-millimeter
film camera records this.

260
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,200
As for Maurice and Katia,

261
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,640
they did not film or photograph
this eruption...

262
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,240
because they could not see or hear it.

263
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,560
As ash descends
on the surrounding area...

264
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,480
Katia and Maurice make their approach.

265
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,680
Katia and Maurice will spend
three months amid the ash...

266
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,840
monitoring, photographing,
studying this force.

267
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,680
And little by little, they
and their fellow researchers

268
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,720
will paint a clearer picture of the event,
with numbers like

269
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,320
two point eight,

270
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,440
the number of cubic kilometers
of land cast off by the mountain.

271
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,280
Twenty-five thousand,
the eruption's force measured

272
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,320
in atomic bombs like the one
that the United States dropped

273
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,640
on Hiroshima.

274
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,360
Fifty-seven,
the official human death toll.

275
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,480
At one point, they will find
the melted tapes of David Johnston.

276
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,160
No matter what
they discover after the blast...

277
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,160
they come no closer to understanding how

278
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,600
to make the most critical measurements
before it.

279
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,520
From this moment on,

280
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,440
they will devote their lives
to this kind of volcano.

281
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,480
The gray volcano.

282
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,440
The killer volcano.

283
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,840
Gray volcanoes may be killers,

284
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,640
but their ash makes the most fertile soil
in the world,

285
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,800
as demonstrated by this killer turnip.

286
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,200
Unlike red volcanoes,
which form when plates pull apart,

287
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,960
grays form when plates collide,
causing pressure and heat

288
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,160
to build and build
until a cataclysmic release.

289
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,920
A Who's-Who of such eruptions
would include Vesuvius in the year 79,

290
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,520
Tambora in 1815,

291
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,240
and Pelée in 1902.

292
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,240
Here is a relatively small one,

293
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,920
Galunggung, in 1982.

294
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,480
And here's Una-Una in 1983.

295
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,720
There may be signs
before an eruption,

296
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,120
but there is no certainty.
No way of knowing the exact timing.

297
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,840
And timing is everything
in the human world.

298
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,040
In 1884,

299
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:23,280
time was set to machines
instead of the wild rhythms of the Earth.

300
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,520
No longer told by the Sun, Moon or stars,

301
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,840
it relied on manufactured intervals
to coordinate railway cars

302
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,120
transporting minerals ripped
from the Earth.

303
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,800
Embraced by the British Empire,
this new railway time soon

304
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,240
mapped the globe.

305
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,560
But a volcano can't be scheduled.

306
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,080
The length of the fuse
is never known.

307
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,720
This is a map
drawn of Nevado del Ruiz,

308
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,760
a gray volcano in Colombia's Andean range.

309
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:35,080
It illustrates the threat if it erupts.
And there's every indication that it will,

310
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,880
as Colombia's geoscientists communicated
to officials in reports.

311
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,480
This one, presented on October 7, 1985,

312
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,120
states that there is
a 100 percent probability of mudflows,

313
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:52,200
with great danger for Armero
and the surrounding towns.

314
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,760
Katia and Maurice
are part of a chorus

315
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,560
who call for warning systems
and evacuation plans.

316
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,920
They know what will happen.

317
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,880
But the decision-makers
deem these plans too costly.

318
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:35,200
On November 14, 1985,
these images circulate around the world.

319
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,480
The volcano erupted the previous day,

320
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,920
and the mudflows swallowed the villages
late at night,

321
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,160
while residents slept.

322
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:58,400
Katia arrives while
Maurice is on a lecture tour in France,

323
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,640
promoting their latest film.

324
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,200
The official death toll climbs
to 22,000...

325
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,960
and then 23,000.

326
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,600
Some reports say 25,000.

327
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,840
The exact number is not known.

328
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,760
Survivors would later recount.

329
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,160
Katia longs for Maurice,

330
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:12,840
who is likely lecturing

331
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,880
at this moment on the creative powers
of volcanoes.

332
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,160
For the first time, she questions
her life's purpose.

333
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,400
Katia and Maurice
had spent their lives

334
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,400
documenting how the Earth's heart beats,

335
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,160
how its blood flows.

336
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:32,240
Now they feel their own human hearts
beating and breaking.

337
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,600
Long ago, Maurice said...

338
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,680
Volcanoes must destroy to create...

339
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:03,840
but must this unruly cycle
take human life?

340
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,560
Katia and Maurice set out

341
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,240
to hunt for the rarest,

342
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,280
deadliest forces
for a new film on volcanic hazards.

343
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,000
It took them one full year
to get these shots

344
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,080
on Alaska's Mount Augustine.

345
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,120
The camera shakes as if it's telegraphing,

346
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,280
whether to stay or run.

347
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:51,440
Perhaps it is because their colleague,
Juergen Kienle,

348
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,200
is about to pull them away
from the burning ash cloud

349
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,520
at the last second.

350
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,960
Several years from now,
their obituary will cite this

351
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:50,200
as the moment where Katia
and Maurice insisted that the risks

352
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,760
should always be minimized...

353
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,560
but that this type of close-up study
had to be done.

354
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,840
Maurice once said,

355
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:28,720
“Look at how small we humans
are against this volcanic force.

356
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,520
"The only thing that will remain
of our passage is that we can write,

357
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,800
"tell stories, and film.”

358
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,000
When you could die
at any moment...

359
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,760
what do you leave behind?

360
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,080
A set of forces
collide inside the planet

361
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:43,080
throughout the enormity of geologic time

362
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,040
to trigger one instant, an eruption,

363
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,920
that forever re-shapes the Earth.

364
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,360
And across humanity's two million years,

365
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,000
two tiny humans are born
in the same place,

366
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,960
at the same time,

367
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,680
and they love the same thing.

368
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:07,720
And that love moved us closer
to the Earth.

369
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,240
June 3rd, 1991,

370
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,640
Mount Unzen begins to wake up
after its 200-year slumber.

371
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,680
The mountain has been stirring since May,

372
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,480
but today, something will shift
inside the Earth.

373
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:36,560
We hope always, but we cannot be sure,
and we don't know nothing.

374
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,200
You have big blocks on the top
and they have to...

375
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,800
to come down, but when?

376
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:54,000
Just after 4:00 p.m.,
it starts to rain.

377
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,840
Ash blows in on a north wind.

378
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,240
Something seems different this time.

379
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,560
The mist obscures their view,

380
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,080
so Katia and Maurice push closer

381
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,640
with their friend, Harry Glicken,
to get a better shot.

382
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,800
A journalist who abandoned
their camera captured this shot.

383
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,280
And there's this moment,
just before the blast.

384
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,840
The last known shot of Katia
and Maurice together.

385
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,640
Japanese officials gave Katia
and Maurice's friend, Yves, this photo.

386
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,160
Their urns resting
in the Shimabara Temple

387
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,680
at the base of Mount Unzen.

388
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,680
Near the site of the surge,
the marks on the earth indicated

389
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,280
that Katia and Maurice were next
to each other.

390
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:07,800
Two items were recovered.

391
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,520
A camera and a watch,

392
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,200
its hands forever frozen in time

393
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,200
at 4:18 p.m.

394
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:23,520
Just over the East China Sea,
Mount Pinatubo trembles.

395
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,360
In one week, it will explode
in the most spectacular

396
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,240
volcanic eruption the Philippines
has ever known.

397
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,760
Fifty-eight thousand people will evacuate.

398
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,600
Officials took the warning signs
seriously, thanks to Katia

399
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,560
and Maurice's film
about understanding volcanoes.

400
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,960
Across the world,
near the French-German border,

401
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:57,640
the Vosges and Rhine fault lines shift
imperceptibly beneath a sleeping Earth.
