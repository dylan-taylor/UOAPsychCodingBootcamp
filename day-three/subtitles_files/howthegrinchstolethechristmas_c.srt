1
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,028
Inside a snowflake,

2
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,322
like the one on your sleeve,

3
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,992
there happened a story
you must see to believe.

4
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,846
Way up in the mountains,
in the high range of Pontoos,

5
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,015
lay the small town of Whoville,

6
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,976
the home of the Whos!

7
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,400
Ask any Who, and they'll have this to say,

8
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:52,530
"There is no place
like Whoville around Christmas Day."

9
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:56,325
Every window was flocked,
every lamppost was dressed,

10
00:01:56,408 --> 00:02:00,746
and the Whoville Band marched
in their Christmas-y best.

11
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,420
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

12
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:24,520
Arbor Day was fine,
and Easter was pleasant,

13
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:27,940
and every Saint Fizzin's Day
they ate a Fizz pheasant,

14
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,986
but every Who knew,
from their 12 toes to their snout,

15
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,280
they loved Christmas the most,

16
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,448
without a single Who doubt.

17
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,414
- Farfingle's welcomes you!
- Thank you.

18
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,042
Merry Christmas! Thank you
for shopping Farfingle's!

19
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,004
We got a snoozlephone

00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,715
and a snoozlephone for your brother Stu,

21
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,260
a muncle for your uncle, a fant for your aunt,

00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,762
and a fandpa for your Cousin Leon.

23
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,307
So, we just need... Cindy?

24
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:02,766
Sale on aisle three!

25
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,810
- Cindy Lou! Cin... Oh.
- Merry Christmas!

26
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,604
Oh, hello, Myrna. Merry Christmas, Fred.

27
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,939
Excuse me one minute. Cindy Lou? Honey?

28
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,483
- Dad?
- Yeah?

29
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,444
Doesn't this seem like a bit much?

30
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,615
This is what Christmas is all about!
Can't you feel it?

31
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,199
Merry Christmas!

32
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,785
Thank you for shopping... Wait a second!

33
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,246
- Don't forget your change!
- Another minute closer to Christmas!

34
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,961
For the next five minutes only, 99 % off!

35
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:48,604
Yes, every Who
down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot,

36
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,858
but the Grinch, who lived
just north of Whoville,

37
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,110
did not.

38
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,824
Hi, girls.
All the good mistletoe's at the top.

39
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,993
Hey, Drew!
I'll race you!

40
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,662
Not if I race you first.

41
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,706
Last one to the top's a stinky old Grinch!

42
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,669
You guys, where are we?

43
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:16,006
- I think we should go back.
- What? You're scared of the Grinch!

44
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,469
- No!
- They say he lives up here in a big cave.

45
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,472
And he only comes down
when he's hungry for the taste of

46
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,349
- Who flesh!
- Oh, Drew!

47
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:28,686
- Guys!
- STU: You're scared of the Grinch!

48
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,354
You're scared of the Grinch!

49
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,856
Are too!

50
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,108
- Am not!
- Are too!

51
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,195
Wait for me!

52
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,709
Can we touch it? Touch the door?

53
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,627
Do it for me, Stu.

54
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,385
Drew?

55
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,745
Well done, Max!

56
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,248
Serves them right, those yuletide-loving

57
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,877
sickly-sweet, nog-sucking cheer mongers!

58
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:40,966
I really don't like 'em.
Mmm-mmm. No, I don't.

59
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,429
Max!

60
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,516
Get my cloak!

61
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,645
I've been much too tolerant
of these "Who-venile" delinquents

62
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,939
and their innocent, victimless pranks.

63
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,444
So, they wanna get to know me, do they?

64
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,323
They want to spend a little
quality time with the Grinch.

65
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:10,079
I guess I could use a little social interaction.

66
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,131
Merry Christmas!

67
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:24,676
Oh, yeah, you bet. Ho, ho, ho, and stuff.

68
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,642
Oh, my. Someone has
vandalized that vehicle.

69
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,895
You see, Max? The city is a dangerous place.

70
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,773
The Grinch hated Christmas,
the whole Christmas season.

71
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,024
Top of the day, flatfoot.

72
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,486
Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.

73
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,987
Hey, kids. Here's a present for ya.

74
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,491
Be sure to run real fast with it, now.
Come on. Double time. Let's go. Move.

75
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,494
It could be that his head
wasn't screwed on just right,

76
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,956
or it could be, perhaps,
that his shoes were too tight.

77
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,833
But I think that the most likely reason of all...

78
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,000
- Merry Christmas!
- Idiot.

79
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,879
...may have been
that his heart was two sizes too small.

80
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,383
Hey, stranger,
won't let you go till you buy a chapeau!

81
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,562
The streets are filled
with Christmas cheer

82
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,730
Boy, nothing beats Christmas, right?

83
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,691
I guess.

84
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,861
- You guess?
- Well, it's just

85
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:28,031
I look around at you and Mom
and everyone getting all kerbobbled.

86
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,034
Doesn't this seem superfluous?

87
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:35,080
Dad! Dad!

88
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,127
- What happened to you?
- It was the Grinch!

89
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,051
- Grinch?
- What do you want? I mean...

90
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,720
Grinch? Oh, no!

91
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,932
Did someone just say, "Grinch"?

92
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,643
Hello, Mayor May Who, sir.

93
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,023
Lou?

94
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,946
I don't need to remind you
that this Christmas marks

95
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,741
the one thousandth Whobilation.

96
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:15,871
- Whoville's most important celebration!
- And The Book of Who says,

97
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:16,997
very clearly,

98
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,751
"Every size of Who we can measure

99
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:24,838
"knows that Whobilation is
a time we must treasure!"

100
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:28,008
Now, Lou, please tell me that your boys

101
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,260
were not up on Mount Crumpit

102
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:34,223
provoking the one creature
within a billion bilometers of here

103
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,475
- who hates Christmas!
- But it was the Grinch!

104
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,647
No, no, no, no, sir,
the boys didn't see any Grinch.

105
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,151
They just... I think they were
up on the mountain

106
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,820
playing with matches,
or defacing public property, or...

107
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,197
Oh, well.

108
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,532
That's a relief.

109
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:57,454
All right, you heard the man,
there's no Grinch problem here.

110
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,130
Lou,
I need it there by tomorrow.

111
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,966
Heckuvarush.

112
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,510
Merry Christmas, Mo. Next in line.

113
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,724
But, Dad. I just don't understand something.

114
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,435
Why won't anyone talk about the Grinch?

115
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,230
You kids and the Grinch!

116
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,734
You see, Cindy,
the Grinch is a Who who always...

117
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,738
Actually, not a Who, he's more of a...

118
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,908
- A what?
- Exactly, honey.

119
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,203
And he's a What who doesn't like Christmas.

120
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,039
Take a look at his mailbox, sweetie.

121
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:45,043
Not a single Christmas card, in or out, ever!

122
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,797
- But why?
- MAN 2: Lou, where's my mail? Lou!

123
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,302
- Got the wrong mail here.
- Lou! I got the wrong mail!

124
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,181
- I'll be right there.
- MAN 1: Lou, we got a problem!

125
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,642
All right, we'll straighten this out.

126
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,940
It'll take them years
to sort this out.

127
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:10,569
This is his and now
it's yours, and this hers and now it's his!

128
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,240
And for the rest of you...

129
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,036
Jury duty! Jury duty! Jury duty!

130
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,872
Blackmail. Pink slip.
Chain letter. Eviction notice.

131
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,707
Jury duty...

132
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:32,549
Would you mind helping me
take this to the back room, honey?

133
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,719
But be careful of the sorting machine, right?

134
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,472
Yeah.

135
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,627
Hmm.

136
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,505
Whew.

137
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,424
Gesundheit. Oh.

138
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,810
You're the...

139
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,437
The... The Grinch!

140
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,193
- Well, that worked out nicely.
- Help!

141
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,986
Help!

142
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,207
- Help me! Somebody!
- GRINCH: Max, let's go.

143
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,961
Our work here is finished. Sheesh!

144
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,381
Help me! Please help!

145
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,341
That is not a chew toy!

146
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,719
Stop it, Max! Get that out of your mouth!

147
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,555
You have no idea where it's been!

148
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,477
Help!

149
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:13,984
Bleeding hearts of the world, unite!

150
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,530
There!

151
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,994
There! Give me that!

152
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,456
Don't you know you're not supposed to take
things that don't belong to you?

153
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,541
What's the matter with you?
You some kind of wild animal?

154
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,172
- Let's go.
- Thanks for saving me!

155
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,055
Saving you?

156
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,100
Is that what you think I was doing?

157
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,685
Uh-huh.

158
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,688
Wrong-o.

159
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:58,111
I merely noticed that
you were improperly packaged, my dear.

160
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,406
Drat! Hold still!

161
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,658
Max, pick out a bow.

162
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,912
Can I use your finger for a second?

163
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,789
Hello! Hello!

164
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,504
- Cindy?
- Dad!

165
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,632
Daddy!

166
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,550
Daddy!

167
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,221
What the hey... Honey.

168
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,848
Cindy!

169
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,850
Dad! It was amazing!

170
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,229
You've been practicing
your Christmas wrapping!

171
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:36,399
- Honey, I am so proud of you.
- Oh, well...

172
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,276
Now, that's holiday.

173
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,404
Sweet little Cindy
didn't know what to do.

174
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,908
In her head bum-tumbled a conflict or two.

175
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,537
"If the Grinch was so bad,
then why did he save me?"

176
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,247
Maybe he wasn't so bad.

177
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,456
Come on, let's go home.

178
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,250
Maybe. Just maybe.

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,087
I've got the Christmas tree
I've got the melody

180
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,924
No lights on in the house.
Your mom must be shoppin'.

181
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,926
Oh, good, I'm so glad
you're home.

182
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:06,304
Oh, I can feel it, Lou. This is the year.

183
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:11,768
When everybody asks who has the most
spectacular lights in all of Greater Whoville,

184
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,106
they're gonna cry out, "Mrs. Betty Lou Who!"

185
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,484
Isn't this the chandelier
from the dining room?

186
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,278
It's all for the cause, dear.

187
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,113
- Oh, and Cindy?
- Oh. Yeah.

188
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,948
Could you be Mommy's Little Helper,

189
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,951
and unscrew the bulb there
from the refrigerator?

190
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,495
- 'Cause somehow I missed that one.
- Go on.

191
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:40,380
Every year Martha May Whovier
has the best lights.

192
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,800
Well, not this year. This year,

193
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:48,179
I'm gonna beat that prim,
perfect little prissy...

194
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,472
Betty!

195
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,101
- Hi!
- Martha!

196
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,647
My, I've never seen so many
beautiful Christmas lights, Betty Lou!

197
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:02,027
Well, I'd blow every fuse
if I tried to keep up with you, Martha May!

198
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,489
Isn't this antique darling? It's handcrafted.

199
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,575
And almost 100 years old.

200
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,328
Jeez. I'm really impressed!

201
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,205
This, however, is new.

202
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,844
Whoa up! Hey! Betty, Betty! Sweetie!

203
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,196
Well, good night, Betty.

204
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,660
Oh! I got it!

205
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,662
- Honey, honey.
- I've got it. I got it. I...

206
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,039
Hello?

207
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,750
Is my sub-zero chillibrator running?

208
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,379
- I suppose.
- Well, you better go catch it!

209
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,846
That's a good one!

210
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,598
That is rich.

211
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,019
Let's go home.

212
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,069
Fleas before beauty. Thank you.

213
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,908
Come on, hurry up. Slowpoke.

214
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,718
There's got to be a better way!

215
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,867
A car would have paid for itself by now!

216
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,538
Oh, goody. Another load coming down.

217
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,753
Ugh, what's that stench?

218
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,046
It's fantastic!

219
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,176
Max! Grab a bag.

220
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,970
We'll come back for the rest.

221
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,681
Of course, when I say "we," I mean "you."

222
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,977
It's amazing what these
Whos just throw away.

223
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:47,358
Oh, well. One man's toxic sludge
is another man's potpourri.

224
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,111
I don't know. It's some kind of soap.

225
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:06,252
Where are you, Christmas

226
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,048
Why can't I find you

227
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:15,678
Why have you gone away

228
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,352
My world is changing

229
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:26,606
I'm rearranging

230
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:29,859
Does that mean Christmas

231
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:35,406
Changes too

232
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:46,292
Where are you, Christmas

233
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,879
Do you remember

234
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:55,760
The girl you used to know

235
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,264
You and I

236
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,392
Were so carefree

237
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,854
Now, nothing's easy

238
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:09,691
Did Christmas change

239
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,778
Or just

240
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,033
Me

241
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,272
Sweet!

242
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,911
Be it ever so heinous

243
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:07,081
There's no place like home

244
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,088
First floor, factory rejects.

245
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,884
Those Whos are hard to frazzle, Max!

246
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,304
But, we did our worst.
And that's all that matters.

247
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:25,016
At least I scared the bejeebles out of that
little girl at the post office.

248
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,352
She'll be scarred for life, if we're lucky.

249
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,454
Funny she didn't rat on us, though.

250
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,665
Must be afraid of reprisals.

251
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:04,514
Yes! Down a size and a half!

252
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:08,685
And this time, I'll keep it off.

253
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,356
Get the stick, Max. Get the stick!

254
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,070
There's no stick!

255
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,655
I'm smarter.

256
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,247
Any calls?

257
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,709
You have no messages.

258
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,504
Odd. Better check the outgoing.

259
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,883
If you
utter so much as one syllable

260
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:44,554
I'll hunt you down and gut you like a fish!

261
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,181
If you'd like to fax me, press the star key.

262
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,310
Oh, well.

263
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,067
That's more like it.

264
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,590
Excellent year.

265
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,301
I'll tell you, Max,

266
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,803
I don't know why I ever leave this place.

267
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,849
I've got all the company I need right here.

268
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,769
Hello!

269
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:34,520
Hello!

270
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:38,107
- How are you?
- How are you?

271
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:41,444
- I asked you first!
- I asked you first!

272
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:45,990
Oh, that's really mature,
saying exactly what I say!

273
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,744
...mature... Mature... Exactly what I say.

274
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,706
- I'm an idiot!
- You're an idiot!

275
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,421
All right, fine.
I'm not talking to you anymore.

276
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,799
In fact, I'm going to whisper,

277
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,885
so that by the time my voice
reverberates off the walls

278
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,470
and gets back to me,

279
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,139
I won't be able to hear it!

280
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,643
You're an idiot!

281
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,990
Am I just eating because I'm bored?

282
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,710
Oh, who could that be?

283
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:44,757
Hello, little girl.
Are you here to read to us?

284
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:48,594
No. I hear
you know some things about the Grinch.

285
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:52,974
Cindy Lou
had some questions in her curious heart.

286
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,270
Why did the Grinch hate Christmas?
Where did it all start?

287
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:00,439
With her dad's blabbacorder,
she wouldn't give an inch.

288
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:05,153
In your own words, please tell me
everything you know about the Grinch.

289
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,698
- Where did he come from?
- Oh, well.

290
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,992
He came the way all Who babies come.

291
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,414
On calm nights, baby Who girls

292
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,708
and tiny Who fellas

293
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:23,421
drift from the sky in their own pumbersellas.

294
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:32,889
Hey, honey!

295
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,557
Our baby's here!

296
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,395
He looks just like your boss.

297
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,149
Oh! So that's how it works.

298
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:48,905
It was Christmas Eve,
and a strange wind blew that night.

299
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,601
We were having
our annual holiday get-together.

300
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:45,670
It was morning before
anybody realized that he was out there!

301
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,798
The poor dear! But, you know what?

302
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,259
We knew right away that he was special.

303
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:54,804
Christmas time is here again

304
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:59,308
Oh. Do you want a Christmas cookie?

305
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,228
Yes, which Christmas cookie would you like?

306
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,396
Santa.

307
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,357
Oh! His first words!

308
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,277
Yes, that is a Santa plate.

309
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,737
Do you want to hold this Santa plate?

310
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,621
Santa, bye-bye!

311
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,336
Oh, he was a wonderful...

312
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,588
Whatever he was.

313
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,426
And we raised him like any other Who child

314
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,220
with a deep love of Christmas.

315
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,977
Don't forget,
tomorrow's our big Christmas gift exchange.

316
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:46,522
Everyone bring a special gift
for a special someone.

317
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,276
The... Grinch...

318
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,447
He had no sense of color coordination.

319
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:59,118
Although I hardly remember him.
I didn't have time to socialize.

320
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:03,205
I was far too busy with my studies.

321
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:06,834
Now, class,
is everyone almost finished?

322
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,423
And if the truth be told, he liked Martha.

323
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,427
Martha was my girlfriend.

324
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:23,225
I don't like discussing this Grinch
so very close to Christmas, but

325
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,270
maybe if you hear the truth,
you'll understand why...

326
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:28,230
Put your back into it!

327
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,609
I tried to take him under my wing.

328
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,527
You don't have a chance with her.

329
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,238
You're eight years old and you have a beard!

330
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,411
He had hair. Not pleasant.

331
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,916
He shed. Not right.

332
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:53,089
You know, Christmas is
my favorite time of year.

333
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,257
I just love the colors.

334
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:59,095
Red. And green.

335
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,351
Did I have a crush
on the Grinch?

336
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,145
Well, of course not.

337
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:12,316
- I didn't ask you that.
- Oh. Right.

338
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,654
For some reason,
when he came home that day,

339
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:19,949
he really got
into the Christmas spirit for the first time.

340
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,117
Baby, picture you and me

341
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,284
Perfect!

342
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:25,496
Hangin' 'round a Christmas tree

343
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,705
Whoopsy.

344
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,375
Colored lights
and an angel up above

345
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:32,503
Christmas of love

346
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,673
What a lovely family heirloom!

347
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:36,799
Gather everyone

348
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:37,967
And they're gonna come

349
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:41,470
Have a lot of fun
at Christmas time

350
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:44,723
Now it's on the way
Everybody say

351
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,643
We're gonna have
a Christmas of love

352
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,603
The fires of love!

353
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,981
Baby, make a little wish

354
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,733
This will be
perfect on the top of her tree.

355
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,695
Oh, Martha! Oh, Christmas!

356
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:00,239
Everything you been
dreaming of

357
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:04,034
- Christmas of love
- CHORUS: Love, love, love

358
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:07,288
I want you all to look your best tomorrow.

359
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,291
You don't have a chance with her.

360
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,335
You're eight years old and you have a beard!

361
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,519
Has everyone given their gifts?

362
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,689
- I haven't.
- ALL: What?

363
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:42,740
Merry Christmas, Martha May.

364
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,535
Why do you have a bag on your head?

365
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:50,915
Probably because
he's embarrassed by that hideoderous gift.

366
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,543
Mr. Grinch,

367
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,921
please take the bag off.

368
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,883
Yes, you take it off.

369
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,556
Put the book down.

370
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,021
And your foot.

371
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,484
Look at that hack job!

372
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,914
Stupid present!

373
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,041
Stupid tree!

374
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,253
I hate Christmas!

375
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,755
- The anger.
- The fury!

376
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:42,091
The muscles!

377
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,312
It was a horrible day,

378
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,190
when they were so cruel to him.

379
00:30:58,774 --> 00:30:59,942
And...

380
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,445
I could hardly bear it.

381
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:22,172
I hate Christmas! I hate it!

382
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,302
And that was
the last time we ever saw him.

383
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,098
The very last time.

384
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:26,028
So, whatever the reason,
his heart or his shoes,

385
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:31,033
he stood outside his cave, hating the Whos.

386
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,410
Alphabetically.

387
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:38,040
Aadvarkian Abakenezer Who,

388
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:41,794
I hate you!

389
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:49,760
Aaron B. Benson Who, I hate you.

390
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,638
Hate, hate, hate. Hate, hate, hate.

391
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,139
Double hate.

392
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:58,102
Loathe entirely!

393
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,485
Nutcrackers?

394
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:10,531
It's their Whobilation.

395
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,283
He snarled with a sneer.

396
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:17,996
Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here.

397
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,416
Max!

398
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:24,044
Fetch me my sedative.

399
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:27,965
Now to take care of those pesky memories.

400
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:33,345
Whobilation, plentiful
With candy canes and pies

401
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:36,348
I can't wait to get there
To eat some google fries

402
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,517
Whobilation, Whobilation

403
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,643
- Dad?
- Yeah.

404
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,979
- I've been thinking about the Whobilation.
- Uh-huh.

405
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,814
And I may do something drastic.

406
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,733
That's fine, dear. Ask your mother.

407
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:48,277
- Where'd she go?
- BETTY: Honey!

408
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,988
Honey. Hi! Oh!

409
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,700
Look, I just found
the cutest light for my Christmas display.

410
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:58,954
Hurry up, we're gonna be late. Come on.

411
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,017
And now, the nominations

412
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,895
for that Who among us who best typifies

413
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:26,440
the qualities of Who-dom and Who-dery

414
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:30,903
the Whoville Holiday Cheermeister!

415
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:41,997
Do I hear a nomination?

416
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,582
I nominate the Grinch!

417
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,544
- The Grinch?
- MAN: The Grinch?

418
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:48,837
The Grinch?

419
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,549
My, my, my.

420
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:56,178
What an altruistic daughter
you have there, Lou!

421
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,514
Thank you.

422
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,433
Cindy?

423
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,897
Let me quote a verse

424
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,358
from The Book of Who.

425
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,068
Thank you.

426
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,362
Ah, "The term 'Grinchy' shall apply

427
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,615
"when Christmas spirit is in short supply."

428
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,910
Now, I ask you, does that sound
like our Holiday Cheermeister?

429
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:24,206
True, Mr. May Who.
But The Book of Who says this too,

430
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,376
"No matter how different a Who may appear,

431
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,379
"he will always be welcomed
with holiday cheer."

432
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:36,426
Whoa. Yes, well, the Book also says, the...

433
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:41,098
"The award cannot go to the Grinch, because

434
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:44,768
"sometimes things get the lead pipe cinch."

435
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,479
You made that up! It doesn't say that.

436
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,898
No, no, no, no, it does.

437
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,150
What page?

438
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:54,736
Uh...

439
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,697
Lost my...

440
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,074
My place, but it's...

441
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:02,077
- It's in here!
- But the Book does say

442
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,747
"The Cheermeister is the one
who deserves a back slap or a toast.

443
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:09,626
"And it goes to the soul
at Christmas who needs it most."

444
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,379
And I believe that soul is the Grinch.

445
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,258
And if you're the Whos I hope you are,

446
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,843
you will too.

447
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:19,887
She's right!

448
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:26,602
Fine. Fine.

449
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,772
You people want to waste
a perfectly good nomination,

450
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,441
why, it's up to you.

451
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:35,068
But I am telling you,

452
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:38,655
the Grinch will never come down.

453
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,783
And when he doesn't,
the Mayor will wear the crown.

454
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,911
Well, more or less.

455
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,748
Deck your heart with jollity

456
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,125
Style your smile
all Christmas-y

457
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:53,295
Flick some flocking
on the tree

458
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,923
Let there be Whobilation

459
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:59,051
Bake the fruitcake
Egg the nog

460
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,803
Feed the flaming Who-ltide log

461
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,723
Baste the beast
and gulp the grog

462
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,517
Let there be Whobilation

463
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:10,020
- Tick, tock, tick tock
- GRINCH: Tick, tock, tick, tock

464
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:13,231
Counting down
the Christmas clock

465
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,901
Old, young, big, small

466
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,827
Blast this Christmas music.

467
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,373
It's joyful and triumphant.

468
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,751
Must drown them out!

469
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,345
Not working!

470
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,017
The whipperwinds
whipped high above the Who town,

471
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:52,854
a trip or a slip, you'd slide all the way down.

472
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:56,692
But this girl had a mission.
She knew what to do.

473
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,860
She'd invite the Grinch herself,

474
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,113
that brave Cindy Lou.

475
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,666
Play, monkey! Play!

476
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,930
Ow-y!

477
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,518
Mr. Grinch?

478
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,356
Mr. Grinch!

479
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:42,571
Hello?

480
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:09,765
Excuse me.

481
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:29,618
Hello, little girl.

482
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,954
How dare you enter

483
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,499
the Grinch's lair?

484
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,627
The impudence! The audacity!

485
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,463
The unmitigated gall!

486
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:45,759
You called down the thunder, now, get ready

487
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,803
for the boom!

488
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:51,932
Gaze into the face of fear!

489
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,811
Mr. Grinch,

490
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,480
my name is Cindy Lou Who.

491
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:02,400
You see, even now the terror

492
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,402
is welling up inside you.

493
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:07,155
I'm not scared.

494
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:11,284
Denial is to be expected
in the face of pure evil.

495
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,330
I don't think so.

496
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,457
Doubt?

497
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:21,461
Another unmistakable sign
of the heebie-jeebies!

498
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,632
Now, you're doomed!

499
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,267
Run for your life,

500
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,061
before I kill again!

501
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,482
I'm a psycho!

502
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,696
Danger! Danger!

503
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:59,040
Um, maybe you need a timeout.

504
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:09,467
Kids today.
So desensitized by movies and television.

505
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:13,972
- What do you want?
- Mr. Grinch,

506
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:19,019
I came to invite you
to be Holiday Cheermeister.

507
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,023
"Holiday Whoobie-what-y?"

508
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,442
- Cheermeister.
- Huh?

509
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,485
"Cheermeister... Celebrate with friends."

510
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,742
That's a good one.

511
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,411
I know you hate Christmas,

512
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,247
- but what if it's all just a misunderstanding?
- Don't care.

513
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:42,542
I mean, I myself am having
some Yuletide doubts.

514
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:45,587
But maybe if you can reunite with the Whos

515
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:47,255
and be a part of Christmas...

516
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:53,053
- Grow up!
- Then maybe it'll be all right for me, too!

517
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,721
I'm sorry, your session is over.

518
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:57,807
Please make another appointment with
the receptionist on the way out.

519
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:00,185
Please, please. You have to accept the award.

520
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:06,942
Award?

521
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:13,073
You never mentioned an award.

522
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,659
Yeah, with a trophy and everything!

523
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,619
- And I won?
- You won!

524
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:21,456
- That means there were losers.
- I guess.

525
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:25,919
- So, if you come...
- A town full of losers!

526
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,837
I like it.

527
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:31,383
Was anyone emotionally shattered?

528
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,885
Come on, a minute ago
I couldn't shut you up!

529
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,470
Details, details!

530
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,973
Well, the Mayor wasn't happy.

531
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,809
Oh! No.

532
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,853
Martha May will be there.

533
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:47,190
- Oh, she will?
- Mmm-hmm.

534
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:51,278
And she'll see me. A winner.

535
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:56,950
She'll be on me like fleegle flies
on a flat-faced floogle horse.

536
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,703
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you, Martha baby.

537
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,663
But the "G" train has left the station.

538
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:03,832
So, will you come?

539
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,625
Oh, all right.

540
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:09,587
I don't know if it's that
adorable twinkle in your eye,

541
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,589
or that nonconformist streak

542
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,884
the reminds me of a younger, less hairy me.

543
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,387
But you've convinced me.

544
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:18,555
Who knows?

545
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:22,517
This Whobilation could change
my entire outlook on life!

546
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,853
- Really?
- No.

547
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:02,849
There you are. Honey.
You can make snow angels later.

548
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:05,727
We can't be late for the Whobilation!

549
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:12,400
The nerve of those Whos.
Inviting me down there.

550
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,319
On such short notice.

551
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:17,947
Even if I wanted to go,
my schedule wouldn't allow it!

552
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,786
"4:00, wallow in self-pity.

553
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:26,122
"4:30, stare into the abyss.

554
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:29,084
"5:00, solve world hunger,

555
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:30,752
"tell no one.

556
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,088
"5:30, Jazzercise.

557
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,424
"6:30, dinner with me."
I can't cancel that again.

558
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,469
"7:00, wrestle with my self-loathing"

559
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,763
I'm booked!

560
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,515
Of course, if I bumped the loathing to 9:00,

561
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,226
I could still be done in time
to lay in bed, stare at the ceiling,

562
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,520
and slip slowly into madness.

563
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,523
But what would I wear?

564
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:13,795
It's not a dress, it's a kilt!

565
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:16,756
Sicko!

566
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:22,470
Stupid. Ugly. Out of date!

567
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:25,640
This is ridiculous.

568
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,185
If I can't find something
nice to wear, I'm not going.

569
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,491
Oh.

570
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,285
Ah.

571
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:47,454
Mmm.

572
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,830
That's it, I'm not going.

573
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:06,181
Well, it's time for our
Holiday Cheermeister of the Year Award!

574
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,690
Congratulations, Mr. Grinch!

575
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:19,694
He isn't here.

576
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:21,613
What?

577
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:25,575
He didn't show? Oh.

578
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,911
Who could have predicted this?

579
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:31,789
All right. I'll swing by for a minute,

580
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:36,044
allow them to envy me, grab a handful
of popcorn shrimp, and blow out of there.

581
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:40,715
But what if it's a cruel prank?
What if it's a cash bar?

582
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,677
How dare they? All right, I'll go.

583
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:48,723
But I'll be fashionably late.
No. Yes. No. Yes. No!

584
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:50,350
Yes!

585
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:53,520
Definitely not!

586
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,272
All right. I've made my decision.

587
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:58,983
I'm going, and that's that.

588
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,861
Had my fingers crossed.

589
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:08,576
Maybe I should flip a coin!

590
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:20,672
Well, I guess the award goes
to the runner-up.

591
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,092
That's right.

592
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,095
A man for whom Christmas comes,
not once a year,

593
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:29,556
but every minute of every day!

594
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:32,392
A handsome, noble man,

595
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,478
a man who's had his tonsils removed twice!

596
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,606
That's an interesting story.

597
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,775
You see, what happened was...

598
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:56,833
Hello, Martha.

599
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,167
He made it!

600
00:47:58,251 --> 00:47:59,377
- Cindy...
- Honey!

601
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:26,029
Boo.

602
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:28,823
Hot crowd. Hot crowd.

603
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:32,744
I believe I'm here to

604
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,874
accept an award of some kind?

605
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,753
And the child

606
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,088
mentioned a check?

607
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:47,008
- No, I didn't.
- All right, then, give me the award.

608
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,010
Come on, while I'm young!

609
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,013
Don't you worry, Mr. Holiday Cheermeister,

610
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,681
you'll get your award.

611
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:57,852
But first, a little family reunion.

612
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,438
They nursed you.

613
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:03,566
They clothed you. Here they are,

614
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,527
your Old Biddies!

615
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:10,907
Are you two still living?

616
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:13,701
- Oh.
- We missed you!

617
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:16,329
Rose. The sweater. The sweater, Rose.

618
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:19,165
Sweater? What are you talkin' about?
No, I can't!

619
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:20,667
I can't do this!

620
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:24,754
Don't touch me there!

621
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,014
Put him in the Chair of Cheer!

622
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,892
Chair of Cheer? What's the Chair of Cheer?

623
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:43,439
- You didn't tell me about the Chair of Cheer!
- Please, Mr. Grinch. Please?

624
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:48,111
No, no, no. I can't do it. Honestly.
I'm not ready. It's too much, too soon!

625
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,821
It's that time of year.

626
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:53,491
The Cheermeister's ride
in the Chair of Cheer!

627
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,828
Put me down! I mean it! I've got a lawyer.

628
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:59,247
There'll be hell to pay!

629
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:03,626
First, you'll put your taste buds to the test

630
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:08,548
- as you judge the Who-Pudding Cook-off!
- Who-Pudding Cook-off!

631
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,758
- Mine first.
- I really don't know.

632
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,635
No, mine's the best!

633
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,554
You'll enjoy this!

634
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,765
This is not pudding.

635
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,017
What is it?

636
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:23,438
This is mine.
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

637
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:26,357
Christmas Conga!

638
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,818
Gee, look at the time.
I really should be getting back.

639
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,778
All right!

640
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:38,035
Fruitcake... Fa la-la!

641
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,037
No.

642
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:47,211
Fudge Judge.

643
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,133
- Made it myself.
- Yeah?

644
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,927
- Mine are homemade too.
- Okay.

645
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,014
Put it in. Bring it on!

646
00:50:58,514 --> 00:51:00,308
Is that all you got?

647
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,518
Is that all you got? Come on.

648
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,484
Outta the way, slow-mo!

649
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,211
He's number one in the sack race run!

650
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:31,130
Number one! I'm number one!

651
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:33,591
I'm number one!

652
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:37,303
No child can beat the Grinch!

653
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:38,513
Yeah!

654
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,393
I beat you!

655
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:59,033
And now it's time
for the moment we've all been waiting for.

656
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:01,369
Yes! My award.

657
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,704
- Write the check.
- There's no check.

658
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:05,248
Are you sure?

659
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:07,625
Because I really thought
I heard someone mention a check.

660
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:08,751
I said, there's no check.

661
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:12,088
And now it's time for Present Pass It On!

662
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,883
As always, we start with our Cheermeister.

663
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,769
A gift of a Christmas shave.

664
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,786
Look at that hack job!

665
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:56,340
Ah, yes, yes, yes. Good times!

666
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,176
Good times.

667
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,054
And now, I have a little something

668
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,973
for the love of my life.

669
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:06,976
Martha May,

670
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:12,607
please become Mrs. Augustus May Who.

671
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:21,991
Augustus.

672
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:27,455
If you agree to be my wife,
along with a lifetime supply of happiness,

673
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:29,540
you'll also receive this...

674
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,795
It's a new car!

675
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:39,091
Generously provided
by the taxpayers of Whoville!

676
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,803
What do you say, Martha?

677
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:46,182
Ya got 20 seconds on the clock.

678
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:50,811
Well, I...

679
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,901
These gifts are quite dazzling.

680
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:09,455
Of course they are.

681
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,500
That's what it's all about, isn't it?

682
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:16,128
That's what it's always been about!

683
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,924
Gifts! Gifts.

684
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:22,426
Gifts, gifts, gifts, gifts, gifts.

685
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,721
You wanna know what happens to your gifts?

686
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:28,849
They all come to me. In your garbage.

687
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:32,603
You see what I'm saying? In your garbage!

688
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:38,359
I could hang myself with all the bad Christmas
neckties I found at the dump!

689
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,278
And the avarice.

690
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:46,117
The avarice never ends!

691
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,703
"I want golf clubs."
"I want diamonds." "I want a pony

692
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:52,039
"so I can ride it twice,
get bored, and sell it to make glue!"

693
00:54:52,665 --> 00:54:54,208
Look, I don't wanna make waves.

694
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,795
But this whole Christmas season

695
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:00,047
is stupid, stupid, stupid!

696
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:03,718
There is, however,

697
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:07,263
one teeny-tiny

698
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:09,557
Christmas tradition

699
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,392
I find

700
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,895
quite meaningful.

701
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:21,694
Mistletoe.

702
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,989
Now, pucker up and kiss it, Whoville!

703
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:36,250
Uh-oh! Somebody's fabulous!

704
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:42,256
All right, your turn! Go on! That way!

705
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:51,015
- Let's go!
- No!

706
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,767
Excuse me, old-timer.

707
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:55,478
Mind if I wet my whistle?

708
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:56,937
Well...

709
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:01,734
That's my good stuff!

710
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,828
Burn, baby! Burn!

711
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:24,840
Oh, wow.

712
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:27,551
Oh, the Whomanity!

713
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:30,721
- Let's go! Come on!
- No! Wait!

714
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:32,973
- Do something.
- Right!

715
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,650
Calling all units. Calling all units.

716
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:47,988
Taxi!

717
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:52,827
It's because I'm green, isn't it?

718
00:56:57,665 --> 00:56:58,999
Halt!

719
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:03,170
Evening, folks. Mind if I ride along?

720
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,840
You might wanna scooch over.

721
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:09,885
You did the right thing.

722
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:19,520
Outta the way!

723
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:22,314
Hey!

724
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:30,948
That's gonna hurt in the morning.

725
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:58,309
It's gonna blow!

726
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:19,413
You fellas all right?
Hey, how about a nice hat?

727
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,623
Lou?

728
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:31,383
I'm hurt, Lou.

729
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,929
I'm hurt, and I don't hurt easily.

730
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:37,765
But you and your family...

731
00:58:38,641 --> 00:58:40,267
I'm so...

732
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:41,936
So disappointed.

733
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:48,525
Can we just get back
to Christmas the way it should be?

734
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,111
Grinch-less?

735
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,406
Merry Christmas!

736
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,451
Merry Christmas!

737
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:05,417
I just wanted everybody
to be together for Christmas.

738
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:12,633
I quite enjoyed that.
I hope I get another invite soon.

739
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:19,265
Come on, come on!

740
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,475
Good thing we have a spare.

741
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:26,730
Suffering snorkelblatz!

742
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,316
They're relentless!

743
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:38,284
Only four hours till Christmas!

744
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:42,454
Yes, the Grinch knew tomorrow

745
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:45,916
all the Who girls and boys
would wake bright and early

746
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,584
and rush for their toys.

747
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:50,713
And then, oh, the noise!

748
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:54,383
Oh, the noise, noise, noise, noise!

749
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,344
They'll bang on tong-tinglers.

750
00:59:57,386 --> 00:59:59,847
They'll blow their floo-flounders.

751
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:03,600
They'll crash on jang-jinglers
and bounce on boing-bounders!

752
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:08,063
Then Whos young
and old would sit down to a feast,

753
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:10,858
and they'll feast and they'll feast.

754
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:14,445
And they'll feast, feast, feast, feast!

755
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:17,031
They'll eat their Who-pudding,

756
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:20,868
and rare Who roast beast!

757
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:25,289
But there's something I just
cannot stand in the least.

758
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:27,041
Oh, no.

759
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:30,961
I'm speaking in rhyme!

760
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:39,386
Blast you Whos!

761
01:00:43,766 --> 01:00:47,978
And the more the Grinch thought
of what Christmas would bring,

762
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:50,564
the more the Grinch thought...

763
01:00:50,773 --> 01:00:53,484
I must stop this whole thing.

764
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:58,906
Why, for year after year
I've put up with it now!

765
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:01,909
I must stop this Christmas from coming!

766
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,369
But how?

767
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,246
I mean, in what way?

768
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:13,337
Well, Christmas is
goin' to the dogs

769
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:18,634
We're scarfing down
the turkey and the grog

770
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:28,977
Are you having a holly, jolly

771
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,105
Christmas?

772
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,483
Wrong-o!

773
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:54,169
If you're not going to help me,

774
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,672
then you might as well...

775
01:01:57,798 --> 01:02:01,885
Then he got an idea.
An awful idea.

776
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:05,180
The Grinch got a wonderful,

777
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,599
awful idea.

778
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:12,229
I know just what to do.

779
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:23,282
The Grinch laughed
in his throat.

780
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:26,702
And he made a quick
Santy Claus hat and a coat.

781
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:32,499
And he chuckled and clucked

782
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,169
at this great Grinchy trick.

783
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:39,173
With this coat and this hat,
I'll look just like St. Nick.

784
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,716
Ho-ho-ho!

785
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:44,511
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch

786
01:02:45,804 --> 01:02:49,183
You really are a heel

787
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:54,188
You're as cuddly as a cactus
and as charming as an eel

788
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,815
Mr. Grinch

789
01:02:57,649 --> 01:03:00,527
You're a bad banana with a

790
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:03,989
Greasy black peel

791
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:12,539
Just face the music
You're a monster

792
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:15,375
Mr. Grinch
Yes, you are

793
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:19,671
Your heart's an empty hole

794
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:23,926
Your brain is full of spiders
You got garlic in your soul

795
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,762
Mr. Grinch

796
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:29,389
I wouldn't touch you with a

797
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:35,729
Thirty-nine
and a half-foot pole

798
01:03:45,948 --> 01:03:49,284
I asked for three-quarters, not five-eighths.

799
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:50,869
Stay focused!

800
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:00,212
You know, if you asked
the Who's Who of Whoville...

801
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,884
No one would deny it

802
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:27,698
Air bag's a little slow.

803
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,578
But that's what these tests are for!

804
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,123
You're a vile one

805
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:37,499
Mr. Grinch

806
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:42,754
You have termites in your smile

807
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:45,674
You have
all the tender sweetness

808
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:47,843
Of a seasick crocodile

809
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,970
Mr. Grinch

810
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:54,474
Given the choice between you
I'd take the

811
01:04:54,808 --> 01:05:00,522
Seasick crocodile

812
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,295
Fat boy should be finishing up anytime now.

813
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:26,340
Talk about a recluse.

814
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:30,844
He only comes out once a year,
and he never catches any flak for it!

815
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:34,890
Probably lives up there to avoid the taxes.

816
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:39,227
Merry Christmas!

817
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:42,606
Oopsie.

818
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:45,817
Forgot about the reindeer.

819
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,446
Did that stop the old Grinch?

820
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,698
No.

821
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:54,201
The Grinch simply said...

822
01:05:54,368 --> 01:05:56,870
If I can't find a reindeer,

823
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:00,874
I'll make one instead.

824
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:08,965
Oh, Max!

825
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,888
So he called his dog Max,

826
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,973
then he took some red thread,

827
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:20,769
and tied a big horn on top of his head.

828
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:25,357
All right.

829
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:27,984
You're a reindeer. Here's your motivation.

830
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:32,030
Your name is Rudolph. You're a freak
with a red nose, and nobody likes you.

831
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:34,908
Then one day, Santa picks you
and you save Christmas.

832
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:39,955
No, forget that part. We'll improvise.

833
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:42,416
Just keep it kinda loosey-goosey.

834
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,751
You hate Christmas! You're gonna steal it!

835
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:48,547
Saving Christmas was a lousy ending.
Way too commercial.

836
01:06:49,965 --> 01:06:51,216
Action!

837
01:06:54,136 --> 01:06:55,595
Brilliant!

838
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:57,848
You reject your own nose

839
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,434
because it represents
the glitter of commercialism!

840
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,477
Why didn't I think of that?

841
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,730
Cut, print, check the gate. Moving on.

842
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:19,578
That feels good.

843
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:33,842
Here goes nothing, hot dog!

844
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:40,724
Wow.

845
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:57,574
This is nuts!

846
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,578
On Crasher! On Thrasher!

847
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:03,872
On Vomit and Blitzkrieg!

848
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:14,382
We're gonna die!

849
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:16,009
We're gonna die!

850
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:20,096
I'm going to throw up,
and then I'm gonna die!

851
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,644
Mommy, tell it to stop!

852
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,036
Ha!

853
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:46,665
Almost lost my cool there.

854
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:56,591
All their windows were dark.
Quiet snow filled the air.

855
01:08:56,675 --> 01:09:01,012
All the Whos were all dreaming
sweet dreams without care,

856
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,890
when he came
to the first little house on the square.

857
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:05,976
Welcome to Whoville, Max.

858
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:15,026
Betty?

859
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,570
- Betty?
- What?

860
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,071
Did you hear something?

861
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:21,867
It's Santa!

862
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,827
Go right back to sleep.

863
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:32,544
Come on, Max. It's our first stop.

864
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:35,088
The old Grinchy Claus hissed,

865
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:38,091
and he climbed to the roof,
empty bags in his fist.

866
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:41,636
He'd slide down the chimney,
a rather tight pinch,

867
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,140
but if Santa could do it,
then so could the Grinch.

868
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:48,351
He's planning a double-twisting
interrupted forward-flying two-and-a-half,

869
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,562
with a combo tuck and pike.

870
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:52,272
High degree of difficulty.

871
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:03,742
He got stuck only once,
for a moment or two.

872
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:07,704
Blasted water weight! Goes right to my hips.

873
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:20,800
Then he stuck
his head out of the fireplace flue.

874
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:24,095
A little more stealth, please.

875
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:26,806
Where the little
Who stockings all hung in a row.

876
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:28,934
- These stockings...
- NARRATOR: He grinned.

877
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,019
...are the first thing to go.

878
01:10:31,478 --> 01:10:34,064
Okay, fellas. Chow time.

879
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,847
Then he slunk to the icebox.

880
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:10,475
Slunk?

881
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:14,562
He eyed the Whos' feast.

882
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:17,107
He took the Who-pudding.

883
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:19,859
He took the roast beast.

884
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:21,403
Hike!

885
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,906
He cleaned out that icebox
as quick as a flash.

886
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:28,952
Why, that Grinch,
he even took their last can of Who-hash.

887
01:11:29,995 --> 01:11:33,456
Then he stuffed all the food
up the chimney with glee.

888
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,669
- And now...
- NARRATOR: Grinned the Grinch.

889
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,548
...I'll stuff up the tree.

890
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:44,926
And the Grinch
grabbed the tree, and he started to shove,

891
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:48,972
when he heard a small sound
like the coo of a dove.

892
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,223
Excuse me.

893
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:59,858
The Grinch had been caught
by this tiny Who daughter,

894
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,569
who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water.

895
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:06,197
Santa Claus?
What are you doing with our tree?

896
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:10,410
But, you know, that old Grinch
was so smart and so slick,

897
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:15,081
he thought up a lie,
and he thought it up quick.

898
01:12:15,582 --> 01:12:19,878
Why, my sweet little tot.

899
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,755
The fake Santa Claus lied.

900
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:27,093
There's a light on this tree that won't light

901
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,595
on one side.

902
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:33,099
So I'm taking it home
to my workshop, my dear.

903
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:40,273
I'll fix it up there,

904
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:43,902
and I'll bring it back here.

905
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,114
Santa, what's Christmas really about?

906
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,824
Vengeance!

907
01:12:52,077 --> 01:12:53,286
I mean,

908
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,248
presents,

909
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:00,335
I suppose.

910
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,715
I was afraid of that.

911
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,470
And his fib fooled the child.

912
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:14,099
Then he patted her head,
and he got her a drink,

913
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:16,101
and he sent her to bed.

914
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,736
- Santa?
- What?

915
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:28,613
Don't forget the Grinch.

916
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:32,325
I know he's mean and hairy and smelly.

917
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:36,579
His hands might be cold and clammy.

918
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:41,751
But I think he's actually kind of sweet.

919
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,044
Sweet?

920
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,011
You think he's sweet?

921
01:13:53,388 --> 01:13:55,348
Merry Christmas, Santa.

922
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:05,233
And when Cindy Lou
went up with her cup...

923
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:06,651
Nice kid.

924
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,863
Bad judge of character.

925
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:14,576
...he went to the chimney
and stuffed the tree up.

926
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:25,837
And the last thing he took
was the log for their fire.

927
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:29,883
On their walls he left nothing
but some hooks and some wire.

928
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,052
And the one speck of food
that he'd left in the house,

929
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:36,931
was a crumb that was
even too small for a mouse.

930
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:43,897
Then he slithered and slunk,
with a smile most unpleasant,

931
01:14:44,022 --> 01:14:47,567
around each Who home,
and he took every present.

932
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:02,207
Clearance sale. Everything must go.

933
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:16,804
What now?

934
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:53,967
Martha,

935
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:57,971
have you ever kissed a man
who lost his tonsils twice?

936
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,974
No, silly.

937
01:16:04,978 --> 01:16:08,815
But it's an experience
that I've always longed for.

938
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:10,566
Kiss me, you fool.

939
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:35,485
What are you laughing at,

940
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:37,945
Rudolph?

941
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,491
It's all you, Maxie!

942
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,911
Three thousand feet
up, up the side of Mt. Crumpit,

943
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:48,956
he rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it.

944
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,252
Whoa!

945
01:17:58,549 --> 01:18:01,803
We did it!

946
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:08,935
We did it! We did it!

947
01:18:09,644 --> 01:18:11,771
That wasn't so bad, was it, Max?

948
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,151
They'll be waking up now.

949
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:23,282
And I know just what they'll do.

950
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:26,160
All those Whos,

951
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,329
down in Whoville,

952
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:30,748
will all cry...

953
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:35,169
Boo-hoo

954
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:38,798
Boo-hoo

955
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:42,468
Boo-hoo

956
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:46,305
Boo-hoo

957
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:51,477
What an embarrassment! I've been robbed!

958
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:23,843
Mayor May Who? Oh, dear.

959
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:34,437
Well, I wonder
who could've done this.

960
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:37,690
Tell you people one thing.

961
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:39,859
Invite the Grinch,

962
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,361
destroy Christmas.

963
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:47,700
Invite the Grinch, destroy Christmas!

964
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:53,414
But did anyone listen to me?

965
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:55,416
- I did.
- No!

966
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:59,378
You choose to listen to a little

967
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:03,049
not-to-be-taken-seriously girl,

968
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:07,011
who hasn't even grown into her nose yet.

969
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:13,726
Cindy, I hope
you're very proud of what you've done.

970
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,570
If she isn't, I am.

971
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:28,199
I'm glad he took our presents.

972
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,245
- What?
- I...

973
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:35,665
Well, I'm glad.

974
01:20:36,249 --> 01:20:38,709
He's glad. You're glad.

975
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:40,962
You're glad everything is gone.

976
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:44,257
You're glad that the Grinch

977
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,384
virtually wrecked...

978
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,928
No, no, no, no, not wrecked,
pulverized Christmas.

979
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,763
Is that what I'm hearing from you, Lou?

980
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,933
You can't hurt Christmas, Mr. Mayor,

981
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:58,187
because it isn't about the gifts
or the contests or the fancy lights.

982
01:20:58,271 --> 01:21:01,440
That's what Cindy's
been trying to tell everyone.

983
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:04,235
And me. She's been trying to tell me.

984
01:21:04,277 --> 01:21:07,655
What is wrong with you? This is a child.

985
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,157
She's my child.

986
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:12,785
And she happens to be right, by the way.

987
01:21:21,711 --> 01:21:26,007
I don't need anything more
for Christmas than this right here, my family.

988
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:32,471
- Merry Christmas, everybody!
- Merry Christmas!

989
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:35,474
Merry Christmas,

990
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,977
you hunk of burnin' Who!

991
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:46,902
Oh, give me a break.

992
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:55,911
Merry Christmas!

993
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:09,967
Mr. Grinch?

994
01:22:11,177 --> 01:22:12,595
Mr. Grinch?

995
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:16,515
Now for the final note in my symphony

996
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:19,310
of downright nasty not-niceness!

997
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:22,396
The crescendo of my odious opus!

998
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:24,357
Yes!

999
01:22:28,194 --> 01:22:31,405
Oh, the wailing and the gnashing of teeth.

1000
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:36,285
The bellowing of the bitterly bummed out!

1001
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:40,247
It'll be like music to my ears!

1002
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:48,381
Welcome, Christmas
come this way

1003
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:52,385
Then the Grinch
heard a sound rising over the snow.

1004
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,389
It started in low, then it started to grow.

1005
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:01,686
But the sound wasn't sad.

1006
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:04,772
Why, this sounded merry.

1007
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:09,068
But it was merry. Very.

1008
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:13,572
Every Who down in Whoville,
the tall and the small,

1009
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:17,118
were singing without any presents at all.

1010
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:27,086
He hadn't stopped Christmas
from coming. It came.

1011
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:30,589
Somehow or other, it came just the same!

1012
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,720
Mr. Grinch?

1013
01:23:38,723 --> 01:23:42,435
And the Grinch,
with his Grinch feet ice-cold in the snow,

1014
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:45,479
stood puzzling and puzzling.

1015
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:47,440
How could it be so?

1016
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:50,025
It came without ribbons!

1017
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:52,153
It came without tags!

1018
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:56,365
It came without packages, boxes or bags!

1019
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:02,121
And he puzzled and puzzled,

1020
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:04,290
till his puzzler was sore.

1021
01:24:07,168 --> 01:24:10,755
Then the Grinch thought of something

1022
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:12,715
he hadn't before.

1023
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:16,510
Maybe Christmas...

1024
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:18,179
He thought.

1025
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:24,727
...doesn't come from a store.

1026
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,149
Maybe Christmas,

1027
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:32,860
perhaps,

1028
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,160
means a little bit more.

1029
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:14,235
Max!

1030
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:16,195
Help me!

1031
01:25:17,071 --> 01:25:18,280
I'm

1032
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,033
feeling!

1033
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:29,458
And what happened then...

1034
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:32,461
Well, in Whoville they say

1035
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:35,047
that the Grinch's small heart,

1036
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:38,926
grew three sizes that day.

1037
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:14,003
What's happening to me?

1038
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,028
I'm all

1039
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:42,031
toasty inside.

1040
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:51,415
And I'm leaking.

1041
01:26:54,919 --> 01:26:56,462
Oh, Max.

1042
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:01,634
I love ya!

1043
01:27:09,642 --> 01:27:12,811
All right, that's enough. Knock it off. Beat it!

1044
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:16,815
Get out of here! One step at a time.

1045
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:28,577
Oh, no. The sleigh. The presents.

1046
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:31,455
They'll be destroyed! And I care!

1047
01:27:31,956 --> 01:27:34,833
What is the deal?

1048
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:36,752
Wait!

1049
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:39,838
This can't happen.

1050
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:42,925
It shouldn't! It couldn't!
It mustn't! It wouldn't!

1051
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:46,387
Not now, not then, not ever again!

1052
01:27:56,647 --> 01:27:59,233
No!

1053
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:40,941
Boo-hoo!

1054
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:48,657
Oh, well.

1055
01:28:49,116 --> 01:28:51,577
It's just toys, right?

1056
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:54,204
Hi, Mr. Grinch.

1057
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:58,042
Cindy Lou!

1058
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:01,211
What are you doing up there?

1059
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,338
I came to see you.

1060
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:05,841
No one should be alone on Christmas.

1061
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:23,317
No!

1062
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:57,601
I got ya, Cindy Lou!

1063
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,311
You did it!

1064
01:30:40,644 --> 01:30:43,188
Spread eagle! Nailed it!

1065
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:04,084
- Are you all right?
- Are you kidding?

1066
01:31:04,168 --> 01:31:06,587
The sun is bright and the powder's bitching!

1067
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:08,755
Now scoot over! It's my turn to drive!

1068
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:18,515
I'd better slow this puppy down!

1069
01:31:22,895 --> 01:31:24,271
We're gonna crash!

1070
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:26,565
Now you listen to me, young lady!

1071
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:29,234
Even if we're horribly mangled,

1072
01:31:29,902 --> 01:31:31,904
there'll be no sad faces on Christmas.

1073
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:46,251
- What is it?
- CINDY: Help!

1074
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:48,086
- Cindy!
- Grinch?

1075
01:31:50,756 --> 01:31:52,007
My baby!

1076
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:57,638
Oh, Martha, grab an end.

1077
01:31:57,804 --> 01:32:00,599
By the way, these lights match
your outfit perfectly.

1078
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:05,479
This could be a little more
difficult to negotiate.

1079
01:32:05,562 --> 01:32:08,023
Heads up, Whoville!

1080
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:11,068
Hurry! Here he comes!

1081
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:14,112
Outta the way! I have no insurance!

1082
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:18,700
Yeah!

1083
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:28,460
Run for your lives! Watch out, I can't stop!

1084
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,798
- Daddy, move!
- Dad, move it!

1085
01:32:43,976 --> 01:32:45,394
Thanks for the help, Lou.

1086
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:47,479
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hi, Cindy, honey.

1087
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:49,982
Merry Christmas,

1088
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:51,942
one and all!

1089
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:53,151
Cindy!

1090
01:32:54,695 --> 01:32:55,862
Mommy!

1091
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:58,156
Merry Christmas.

1092
01:32:59,408 --> 01:33:00,826
Cindy!

1093
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:05,163
All right.

1094
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:08,458
What do we have here?

1095
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:11,545
You got me, Officer!

1096
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:14,131
I did it!

1097
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:16,967
I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas.

1098
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:21,346
And I'm sorry.

1099
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:28,228
Aren't you gonna cuff me?

1100
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:31,857
Put me in a choke hold?
Blind me with pepper spray?

1101
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:34,067
You heard him, Officer. He admitted it.

1102
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:36,862
I'd go with the pepper spray.

1103
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:38,488
Yes, I heard him, all right.

1104
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:41,491
He said he was sorry.

1105
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:47,122
Besides, it looks like
everything is all here and accounted for.

1106
01:33:47,456 --> 01:33:50,751
Help me out here, people. Martha?

1107
01:33:51,043 --> 01:33:53,879
Merry Christmas, Augustus May Who!

1108
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:57,674
I'm afraid I do have something for you.

1109
01:34:09,353 --> 01:34:10,896
Your ring back.

1110
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:14,691
Sorry, but my heart belongs to

1111
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:17,361
someone else.

1112
01:34:33,293 --> 01:34:35,170
No hard feelings?

1113
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:44,054
Cheer up, dude. It's Christmas.

1114
01:34:58,944 --> 01:35:01,113
Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch.

1115
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:07,202
Your cheek's so...

1116
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:10,956
I know. Hairy?

1117
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:14,000
- No.
- Greasy?

1118
01:35:14,418 --> 01:35:16,586
Stinky? Do I have a zit?

1119
01:35:16,962 --> 01:35:18,213
No.

1120
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:21,174
Warm.

1121
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:30,684
Fah who Foraze

1122
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:33,019
Dah who Doraze

1123
01:35:33,103 --> 01:35:37,649
Welcome, Christmas Come this way

1124
01:35:37,983 --> 01:35:40,402
Fah who Foraze

1125
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:42,904
Dah who Doraze

1126
01:35:42,988 --> 01:35:47,868
Welcome, Christmas,
Christmas Day

1127
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:52,831
Welcome, welcome
Fah who Ramus

1128
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:57,711
Welcome, welcome
Dah who Damus

1129
01:35:57,836 --> 01:36:02,549
Christmas Day is in our grasp

1130
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:07,429
So long as we have hands
to clasp

1131
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:10,182
Fah who Ray Moo

1132
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:12,851
Yah who Hee Haw

1133
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:15,270
Welcome, Christmas

1134
01:36:15,353 --> 01:36:17,981
- Bring your Cheer
- Cheer

1135
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:20,484
Fah who Foraze

1136
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,694
Yah who Doraze

1137
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:26,364
Welcome, all Whos Far

1138
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:29,993
And

1139
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:34,581
Near

1140
01:36:34,831 --> 01:36:38,376
So he brought back
the toys and the food for the feast.

1141
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:44,049
And he, he himself,
the Grinch, carved the roast beast.

1142
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:45,258
Yeah!

1143
01:36:59,898 --> 01:37:01,566
There's nothing
like the holidays.

1144
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:04,069
- Who wants the gizzard?
- LOU: I do!

1145
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:06,738
Too late! That'll be mine.

1146
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:10,700
Where are you, Christmas

1147
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:14,579
I think I've found you

1148
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:20,460
This time I'll make you stay

1149
01:37:21,503 --> 01:37:25,131
All will be singing

1150
01:37:25,215 --> 01:37:28,802
Bells will be ringing

1151
01:37:28,969 --> 01:37:32,722
Now and forever

1152
01:37:32,764 --> 01:37:37,978
Christmas Day

1153
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:07,090
Where are you, Christmas

1154
01:38:07,132 --> 01:38:10,927
Why can't I find you

1155
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:16,975
Why have you gone away

1156
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:24,482
Where is the laughter

1157
01:38:24,566 --> 01:38:28,820
You used to bring me

1158
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:34,701
Why can't I hear music play

1159
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:42,042
My world is changing

1160
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:46,379
I'm rearranging

1161
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:50,175
Does that mean Christmas

1162
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:56,765
Changes too

1163
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:08,151
Where are you, Christmas

1164
01:39:08,193 --> 01:39:12,530
Do you remember

1165
01:39:12,656 --> 01:39:18,828
The one you used to know

1166
01:39:21,414 --> 01:39:25,585
I'm not the same one

1167
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:30,048
See what the time's done

1168
01:39:30,215 --> 01:39:33,760
Is that why you have

1169
01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:40,100
Let me go

1170
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:46,398
Christmas is here

1171
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:49,025
Everywhere

1172
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:55,073
Christmas is here

1173
01:39:55,156 --> 01:39:58,827
If you care

1174
01:40:01,121 --> 01:40:03,832
If there is love

1175
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:08,712
In your heart and your mind

1176
01:40:08,878 --> 01:40:15,260
You will feel like Christmas
all the time

1177
01:40:18,096 --> 01:40:22,308
I feel you, Christmas

1178
01:40:22,392 --> 01:40:26,730
I know I've found you

1179
01:40:26,855 --> 01:40:33,194
You never fade away

1180
01:40:35,655 --> 01:40:39,951
The joy of Christmas

1181
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:44,289
Stays here in silence

1182
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:49,461
Fills each and every heart

1183
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:56,843
With love

1184
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:11,316
They're makin' noise

1185
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:14,152
Noise, noise, noise

1186
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:19,032
How I hate their happy noise

1187
01:41:20,992 --> 01:41:23,953
There's only one thing
I hate more

1188
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:26,414
Come to think of it

1189
01:41:26,498 --> 01:41:29,667
And that's the people who keep

1190
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:31,252
Makin' it

1191
01:41:31,628 --> 01:41:34,714
Feast, feast, feast, feast

1192
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:41,012
They'll have more
than anyone could ever eat

1193
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:44,516
Me, I'm stuck here with my

1194
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:46,810
Cream of wheat

1195
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:50,104
There's no one here
to feast with me

1196
01:41:52,565 --> 01:41:55,902
On this lonely Christmas Eve

1197
01:41:57,862 --> 01:42:01,199
Don't they know
I'm up here all alone

1198
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:05,829
In my cave up in the hills

1199
01:42:08,331 --> 01:42:11,876
How I wish that
this would go away

1200
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,462
This dreadful holiday

1201
01:42:14,546 --> 01:42:17,966
That they call Christmas Day

1202
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:27,267
It's a lonely Christmas Eve

1203
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:39,737
The streets are filled
with Christmas cheer

1204
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:43,783
At least it's only once a year

1205
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:48,329
Perfect parcels tied
with perfect bows

1206
01:42:48,413 --> 01:42:51,875
And carols ringing in my ear

1207
01:42:52,375 --> 01:42:55,753
Bundled up against the cold

1208
01:42:56,296 --> 01:42:59,716
Lines wherever gifts are sold

1209
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:04,304
Each shop window
displays a Christmas scene

1210
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:07,974
For everybody young and old

1211
01:43:08,433 --> 01:43:11,769
Icicles on eaves troughs
and tinsel on the tree

1212
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:15,315
But it's a green Christmas
for me

1213
01:43:18,318 --> 01:43:21,821
Couples skating on the pond

1214
01:43:22,363 --> 01:43:25,867
Makin' angels on the lawn

1215
01:43:26,326 --> 01:43:30,163
Five red mittens
drying on the rack

1216
01:43:30,288 --> 01:43:34,292
And needle-shedding Tannenbaum

1217
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:37,795
Red bows on the railings
and snowflakes on the ground

1218
01:43:37,879 --> 01:43:42,050
But it's a green Christmas
in this town

1219
01:43:44,302 --> 01:43:45,929
Green

1220
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:49,807
'Cause of everything I miss

1221
01:43:49,891 --> 01:43:53,102
All this mistletoe
No kiss

1222
01:43:53,895 --> 01:43:56,981
And with every Christmas wish

1223
01:43:57,815 --> 01:44:01,694
There would be no greater gift

1224
01:44:01,778 --> 01:44:04,989
Than to have this envy lift

1225
01:44:16,459 --> 01:44:20,254
Carolers are at my door

1226
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:24,175
Don't wanna hear them anymore

1227
01:44:24,342 --> 01:44:27,845
Stockings on the mantel
The snow's here every day

1228
01:44:27,929 --> 01:44:31,891
But it's a green Christmas anyway

1229
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:35,770
Red nose on the reindeer
Tinsel on the tree

1230
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:39,607
But it's a green Christmas
for me
