1
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,374
Sure I won't get in trouble, Bill?

2
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:24,544
Don't be a wuss.

3
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:28,298
I'd come with you if I weren't
dying.

4
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:30,884
You're not dying!

5
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:34,721
You didn't see the vomit
coming out of my nose this morning?

6
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:37,390
That's disgusting.

7
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:40,643
Okay. Go get the wax.

8
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:43,938
In the cellar?

9
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,941
You want it to float, don't you?

10
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,902
Fine.

11
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:49,629
<i>Georgie.</i>

12
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:51,297
Hurry up.

13
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,432
Okay. I'm brave.

14
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,496
Where's the wax?

15
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,124
There's the wax.

16
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:28,293
Yes.

17
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,773
What was that? What's that?

18
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:52,442
Oh, jeez.

19
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:12,795
All right.

20
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,006
There you go.

21
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,175
She's all ready, Captain.

22
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:18,384
She?

23
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:21,179
You always call boats "she."

24
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:23,556
"She."

25
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:25,099
Thanks, Billy.

26
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,818
See you later. Bye.

27
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:03,805
Be careful.

28
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:53,896
No!

29
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:56,107
No!

30
00:05:58,109 --> 00:05:59,485
Oh, Bill's gonna kill me.

31
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,706
Hiya, Georgie.

32
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:15,460
What a nice boat.

33
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,545
Do you want it back?

34
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:20,048
Um, yes, please.

35
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:23,509
You look like a nice boy.
I bet you have a lot of friends.

36
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:27,680
Three, but my brother's my best best.

37
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:29,140
Where is he?

38
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:31,476
In bed. Sick.

39
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:35,146
I bet I can cheer him up.
I'll give him a balloon.

40
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,400
Do you want a balloon too, Georgie?

41
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:43,821
I'm not supposed to take stuff
from strangers.

42
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:48,576
Oh... Well, I'm Pennywise
the Dancing Clown.

43
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:53,915
"Pennywise?" "Yes."
"Meet Georgie.

44
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,375
"Georgie, meet Pennywise."

45
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,130
Now we aren't strangers, are we?

46
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,111
What are you doing in the sewer?

47
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,822
A storm blew me away.

48
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:29,325
Blew the whole circus away.

49
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:34,539
Can you smell the circus, Georgie?

50
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:39,752
There's peanuts, cotton candy,

51
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:41,921
<i>hot dogs,</i>

52
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,798
and...

53
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:45,758
Popcorn?

54
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:48,136
Popcorn! Is that your favorite?

55
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:51,097
- Uh-huh.
- Mine, too.

56
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:55,059
Because they pop.
Pop, pop, pop.

57
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:57,603
Pop, pop, pop.

58
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:59,730
Pop.

59
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:11,117
I should get going now.

60
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:12,368
Oh.

61
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,537
Without your boat?

62
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,498
<i>You don't wanna lose it, Georgie.</i>

63
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,834
Bill's gonna kill you.

64
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,881
Here.

65
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:27,216
Take it.

66
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,972
Take it, Georgie.

67
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,703
Help!

68
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:05,963
Billy!

69
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,695
<i>Pull it, Mike.</i>

70
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,533
<i>Go on now, pull it.</i>

71
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:27,628
Here, reload it.

72
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:30,756
You need to start taking
more responsibility around here, Mike.

73
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,425
Your dad was younger than you
when he took--

74
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,844
I'm not my dad, okay?

75
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:36,595
Yeah.

76
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,141
Look at me, son.

77
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,059
Look at me!

78
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,231
There are two places you can be
in this world.

79
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,359
You can be out here like us
or you can be in there,

80
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,320
like them.

81
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,280
You waste time hemming and hawing,

82
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,867
and someone else
is gonna make that choice for you.

83
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:02,747
Except you won't know it until
you feel that bolt between your eyes.

84
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:14,175
So, there's this church
full of Jews, right?

85
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,302
And Stan has to take this
super Jewy test.

86
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,970
But how's it work?

87
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:19,930
They slice the tip of his dick off.

88
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,432
But then Stan will have nothing left!

89
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,309
- That's true.
- Wait up, you guys!

90
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,020
Hey, Stan, what happens
at the Bar Mitzvah, anyways?

91
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:29,565
Ed says they slice
the tip of your dick off.

92
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:31,984
Yeah, and I think the rabbi's
gonna pull down your pants,

93
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:33,569
turn to the crowd and say,
"Where's the beef?"

94
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,448
At the Bar Mitzvah,
I read from the Torah,

95
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,992
and then I make a speech
and suddenly, I become a man.

96
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,744
I could think of funner ways
to become a man.

97
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,079
<i>"More fun" you mean.</i>

98
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,288
Oh, shit.

99
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,546
Think they'll sign my yearbook?

100
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:53,756
"Dear Richie,

101
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:56,467
"sorry for taking a hot, steaming dump
in your backpack last March.

102
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,469
<i>"Have a good summer."</i>

103
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,523
<i>Are you in there
by yourself, Beaver-ly?</i>

104
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,234
Or do you have half the guys in the school
with you, huh, slut?

105
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,779
I know you're in there, little shit.
I can smell you.

106
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,781
<i>No wonder you don't have any friends.</i>

107
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:22,910
Which is it, Gretta?
Am I a slut or a little shit?

108
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:24,495
Make up your mind.

109
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,830
You're trash.

110
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:29,542
We just wanted to remind you.

111
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,709
<i>Such a loser.</i>

112
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:36,549
<i>Well, at least now
you'll smell better.</i>

113
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,758
<i>Gross.</i>

114
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,927
Let's go, girls.

115
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:41,762
<i>Have a nice summer, Beaver-ly.</i>

116
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,848
<i>Pathetic.</i>

117
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,274
Best feeling ever.

118
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:54,442
Yeah?

119
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,193
Try tickling your pickle
for the first time.

120
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:57,695
Hey, what do you guys wanna do tomorrow?

121
00:12:57,862 --> 00:12:59,029
I start my training.

122
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,865
- Wait, what training?
<i>- Street Fighter.</i>

123
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,534
Is that how you wanna spend your summer?
Inside of an arcade?

124
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,453
Beats spending it inside of your mother.

125
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,371
- Oh!
- What if we go to the quarry?

126
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,041
Guys, we have the Barrens.

127
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,294
Right.

128
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:15,713
Betty Ripsom's mom.

129
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,842
<i>Is she really expecting to
see her come out of that school?</i>

130
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:21,719
I don't know.

131
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:24,054
As if Betty Ripsom's been hiding
in Home Ec. for the last few weeks.

132
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:25,514
You think
they'll actually find her?

133
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:26,682
Sure.

134
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:29,310
In a ditch. All decomposed,
covered in worms and maggots.

135
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,561
Smelling like Eddie's mom's underwear.

136
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,062
Shut up! That's freaking disgusting.

137
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:35,316
She's not dead. She's missing.

138
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,776
Sorry, Bill. She's missing.

139
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:41,906
You know the Barrens aren't that bad.

140
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,700
Who doesn't love splashing around
in shitty water?

141
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,039
Nice Frisbee, flamer.

142
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,916
Give it back!

143
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,167
Fucking losers!

144
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,422
Loser.

145
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,425
You suck, Bowers.

146
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:02,927
Shut up, Bill.

147
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:12,061
You say something, Billy?

148
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,606
You got a free ride this year
'cause of your little brother.

149
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,275
Ride's over, Denbrough.

150
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,577
This summer's gonna be a hurt train
for you and your faggot friends.

151
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,425
I wish he'd go missing.

152
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,177
He's probably the one doing it.

153
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:57,815
You gonna let me go by?

154
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:59,817
Or is there a secret password
or something?

155
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,068
Oh.

156
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,362
- Um, sorry.
- Sorry isn't...

157
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,533
A password.

158
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,377
Henry and his goons are over
by the west entrance.

159
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,712
So you should be fine.

160
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:20,963
Oh, I wasn't--

161
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,007
Everyone knows he's looking for you.

162
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,719
What you listening to?

163
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,143
New Kids on the Block.

164
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,686
I don't even like them. I was just--

165
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,148
Wait. You're the new kid, right?
Now I get it.

166
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:40,858
There's nothing to get.

167
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,068
I'm just messing with you.

168
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,696
I'm Beverly Marsh.

169
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:49,241
Yeah. I know that
'cause we're in the same class.

170
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,535
Social Studies. And you were...

171
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:56,165
I'm Ben. But pretty much
everybody just calls me...

172
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,708
The new kid.

173
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:01,086
Well, Ben, there are worse things
to be called.

174
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:02,921
Let me sign this.

175
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:26,236
Stay cool, Ben from sosh class.

176
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,780
Uh, yeah.

177
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:29,740
You too, Beverly.

178
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,992
Hang tough, new kid on the block.

179
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,747
"Please Don't Go, Girl."

180
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:42,002
That's the name of another
New Kids on the Block song.

181
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,764
"He thrusts his fists
against the posts...

182
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,477
"He thrusts his fists against...

183
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,107
Shit!

184
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,110
"Post."

185
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,870
Need some help? I...

186
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,997
I thought we agreed.

187
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,045
- Before you say anything--
- Bill.

188
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,673
Just let me show you something first.

189
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:46,525
The Barrens.

190
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:50,028
It's the only place that
Georgie could have ended up.

191
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,697
He's gone, Bill.

192
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,660
But if the storm swept Georgie in,
we should have gone--

193
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:59,872
He's gone! He's dead!

194
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,668
<i>He's dead! There is nothing we can do!
Nothing!</i>

195
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,425
Now take this down
before your mother sees it.

196
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,017
Next time you wanna take something
from my office...

197
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,187
Ask.

198
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,527
I guess you get your tunnels back.

199
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,683
Get in!

200
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:02,893
<i>Creep!</i>

201
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,195
Oh, Jesus.

202
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,227
<i>Mike!</i>

203
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,149
<i>Hurry, son!</i>

204
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,985
<i>Help! It burns!</i>

205
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:56,780
<i>Mike!</i>

206
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,478
Stay the fuck outta my town!

207
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,820
Mike?

208
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,489
<i>Are you okay?</i>

209
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,508
You're not studying, Stanley.

210
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,303
How's it going to look?

211
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,681
The rabbi's son
can't finish his own Torah reading.

212
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,142
Take the book to my office.

213
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,269
<i>Obviously you're not using it.</i>

214
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,762
<i>Take everything
but the Delicious Deals, guys.</i>

215
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,055
<i>My mom loves them.</i>

216
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:11,975
Hey! First you said the Barrens,
and now you're saying the sewer.

217
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,644
I mean, what if we get caught?

218
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,439
We won't, Eds.
The sewers are public works.

219
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:18,940
We're the public, aren't we?

220
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:21,818
Hey, Eddie,
these your birth control pills?

221
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:25,572
Yeah, and I'm saving it for your sister.
This is private stuff.

222
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:29,451
<i>Hello, and welcome to
the</i> Derry Children's Hour.

223
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:33,747
Eddie Bear, where you boys off to
in such a rush?

224
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,458
Um...

225
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,961
Just my backyard, Mrs. K.

226
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,089
I got a new...

227
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:48,345
- A new croquet set.
- Jeez, spit it out, Bill!

228
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:49,596
Okay.

229
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,682
Oh, and sweetie, don't go
rolling around on the grass.

230
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,601
Especially if it's just been cut.

231
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,229
You know how bad your allergies can get.

232
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:58,814
Yes, Mom. Let's go.

233
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,148
<i>Aren't you forgetting something?</i>

234
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:03,401
<i>Water is all around us.
It's even above us.</i>

235
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,241
<i>Don't believe me?</i>

236
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:10,867
<i>Then try it yourself at home.</i>

237
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,994
<i>Whenever you're outside...</i>

238
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,330
Do you want one from me too, Mrs. K?

239
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,915
- I was kidding.
- No, no, no.

240
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,751
Sorry, Mommy.

241
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,484
"Your hair is winter fire,
January embers...

242
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,444
"My heart burns there too."

243
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:47,654
<i>Slow down!</i>

244
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:49,614
<i>Hi-ho, Silver!</i>

245
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:50,824
Away!

246
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,243
Your old lady bike's
too fast for us!

247
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,203
Found it.

248
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:57,080
Isn't it summer vacation?

249
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:00,125
I would think you'd be ready
to take a break from the books.

250
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,418
I like it in here.

251
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:05,338
A boy should be spending his summer
outside with friends.

252
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,883
Don't you have any friends?

253
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,468
Can I have the book now?

254
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:14,194
<i>Egg boy.</i>

255
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:19,074
<i>What on earth are you doing?</i>

256
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,429
Where are you off to, tits?

257
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:45,350
Gotcha.

258
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,602
<i>Wait.</i>

259
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:48,978
- Fucking hold him.
- Leave me alone!

260
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,146
- Smack him.
- Don't let tubby get away.

261
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,314
Help!

262
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,983
Get him!

263
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:57,153
- Hold him, Hockstetter.
- Get him, Belch.

264
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,281
Stop!

265
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,118
- Just leave me alone.
- Look at all this blubber!

266
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:07,288
Let me light his hair,
like Michael Jackson.

267
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:08,915
Just hold him.

268
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:11,209
Get off me! Get off me!

269
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:20,677
Help!

270
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:23,972
Help!

271
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:29,853
Okay, new kid.

272
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:31,896
This is what us locals
call the Kissing Bridge.

273
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:35,191
It's famous for two things.
Sucking face,

274
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,069
and carving names.

275
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:39,612
Henry, please.

276
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:47,287
Whoa, whoa! Henry!

277
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:48,538
Shut up!

278
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,833
I'm gonna carve my whole name
onto this cottage cheese!

279
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,673
I'm gonna cut your fucking tits off.
I swear to God!

280
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:00,216
Get him!

281
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:01,384
<i>Come on!</i>

282
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,222
<i>Get him!</i>

283
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:07,682
You can't run!

284
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,852
- Oh, no!
<i>- We need to find Fatty!</i>

285
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:20,570
My knife. My old man will kill me!

286
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,825
- You two, get him!
- Come on!

287
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,662
Move your fucking ass!

288
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,541
<i>He's going that way! Come on!</i>

289
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:37,253
<i>He's down there.</i>

290
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,412
I don't know. I guess.

291
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:17,377
That's poison ivy.
And that's poison ivy.

292
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:18,795
And that's poison ivy.

293
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,672
Where? Where's the poison ivy?

294
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,759
Nowhere. Not every fucking plant
is poison ivy, Stanley.

295
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,053
Okay, I'm starting to get itchy now

296
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:28,429
and I'm pretty sure
this is not good for my--

297
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:31,182
Do you use the same bathroom
as your mother?

298
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:32,433
Sometimes, yeah.

299
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,102
Then you probably have crabs.

300
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,311
<i>That's so not funny.</i>

301
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,693
Aren't you guys coming in?

302
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,237
Uh-uh. It's greywater.

303
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:45,613
What the hell's greywater?

304
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:48,616
It's basically piss and shit.
So I'm just telling you,

305
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:53,288
<i>you guys are splashing around
in millions of gallons of Derry pee. So...</i>

306
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:54,539
Are you serious? What are you--

307
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,708
Doesn't smell like caca to me, <i>señor.</i>

308
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,710
Okay, I can smell that from here.

309
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:01,170
It's probably just your breath
wafting back into your face.

310
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:03,673
Have you ever heard
of a staph infection?

311
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,049
Oh, I'll show you a staff infection.

312
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:06,759
<i>This is so unsanitary.
You're literally...</i>

313
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,053
<i>This is literally like swimming
inside of a toilet bowl right now.</i>

314
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:10,680
<i>Have you ever heard of Listeria?</i>

315
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:13,516
<i>Are you retarded?</i>

316
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,476
You're the reason why
we're in this position right now.

317
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:16,936
Guys!

318
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,232
Shit. Don't tell me that's...

319
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:22,859
<i>No.</i>

320
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,445
Georgie wore galoshes.

321
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,364
Whose sneaker is it?

322
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,452
It's Betty Ripsom's.

323
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:34,078
Oh, shit.

324
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,580
<i>Oh, God. Oh, fuck!</i>

325
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:36,831
I don't like this.

326
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,833
How do you think Betty feels?

327
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:42,211
Running around these tunnels
with only one frickin' shoe?

328
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:47,842
What if she's still here?

329
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:54,349
Eddie, come on!

330
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:57,226
My mom will have an aneurysm, if she
finds out that we're playing down here.

331
00:32:57,393 --> 00:32:58,394
I'm serious.

332
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,105
Bill?

333
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,320
If... If I was Betty Ripsom,
I would want us to find me.

334
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,406
Georgie too.

335
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,368
What if I don't want to find them?

336
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:19,040
I mean, no offense, Bill,
but I don't want to end up like...

337
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,586
I don't want to go missing either.

338
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:26,506
- He has a point.
- You too?

339
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:28,091
It's summer.

340
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:29,717
We're supposed to be having fun.

341
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,303
<i>This isn't fun.</i>

342
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:34,305
This is scary and disgusting.

343
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,064
Holy shit! What happened to you?

344
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:28,025
I hear ya, tits.

345
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:47,879
Don't think you can stay down here
all damn day now.

346
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:03,644
You found us, Patrick.

347
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:06,773
<i>You found us, Patrick.</i>

348
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,276
<i>Patrick.</i>

349
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:27,668
Fuck!

350
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,785
I think it's great that
we're helping the new kid,

351
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,370
but also we need to think
of our own safety.

352
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,121
I mean, he's bleeding all over
and you guys know

353
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,415
that there's an AIDS epidemic happening
right now as we speak, right?

354
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:10,127
My mom's friend in New York City got it
by touching a dirty pole on the subway.

355
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:13,339
And a drop of AIDS blood got into
his system through a hangnail. A hangnail!

356
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:16,342
And you can amputate legs and arms.

357
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:19,095
But how do you amputate a waist?

358
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:21,639
You guys do know that alleys are known
for dirty needles that have AIDS, right?

359
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:22,807
You guys do know that?

360
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:24,642
- Hey...
- Ah, we're screwed.

361
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,561
Richie, wait here. Come on.

362
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:33,067
Glad I got to meet you
before you died.

363
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:42,451
Okay.

364
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:45,538
<i>Can we afford all that?</i>

365
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:46,789
It's all we got.

366
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:48,124
You kidding me?

367
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,795
Wait, you have an account here,
don't you?

368
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:55,965
If my mom finds out
I bought all this stuff for myself...

369
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:59,051
I'm spending the whole rest of the weekend
in the emergency room getting X-rayed.

370
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:13,983
<i>See you later, Dad.</i>

371
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,152
<i>See you, Gretta.</i>

372
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:23,075
You okay?

373
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:26,829
I'm fine. What's wrong with you?

374
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,331
None of your business.

375
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,708
There's a kid outside.
Looked like someone killed him.

376
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,962
We need some supplies,

377
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:37,840
but we don't have enough money.

378
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:44,889
I like your glasses, Mr. Keene.

379
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,808
You look just like Clark Kent.

380
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:49,310
Oh.

381
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,020
I don't know about that.

382
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:52,480
Can I try them?

383
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:56,317
Mmm. Sure.

384
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:04,033
What do you think?

385
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:07,244
Well, how about that?

386
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:09,914
You look just like Lois Lane.

387
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,042
Really?

388
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:14,627
Mmm.

389
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,340
Well, here you go.

390
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:22,176
Shoot, I'm so sorry.

391
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:23,928
It's okay.

392
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:38,192
<i>Just suck the wound.</i>

393
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:40,277
<i>- I need to focus right now.</i>
<i>- You need to focus?</i>

394
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,612
Yeah, can you go get me something?

395
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,864
- Jesus! What do you need?
- Go get my bifocals.

396
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:45,199
I hid 'em in my second fanny pack.

397
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:46,784
<i>Why do you have two fanny packs?</i>

398
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:48,494
<i>I need to focus right now
and it's a long story.</i>

399
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:49,704
<i>I don't want to get into it.</i>

400
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,218
Um, thanks.

401
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,428
Even-Steven.

402
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:07,972
<i>Oh, God, he's bleeding.
Oh, my God!</i>

403
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,223
Ben from sosh?

404
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,767
You have to suck the wound
before you apply the Band-Aids.

405
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,769
- This is 101.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

406
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:15,938
Are you okay?
That looks like it hurts.

407
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:18,107
Oh. No, I'm good. I just fell.

408
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,650
Yeah, right into Henry Bowers.

409
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,318
Shut it, Richie.

410
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:22,737
Why? It's the truth.

411
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:27,783
You sure they got the right stuff
to fix you up?

412
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:33,789
You know, we'll take care of him.

413
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,291
Uh, thanks again, Beverly.

414
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:38,461
Sure. Maybe I'll see you around.

415
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,671
Yeah, we were thinking about

416
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:42,423
going to the quarry tomorrow,

417
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:44,341
if you wanna

418
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:45,760
<i>come.</i>

419
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:48,679
Good to know. Thanks.

420
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,393
Nice going bringing up Bowers
in front of her.

421
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:55,603
Yeah, dude, you heard what she did.

422
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:57,897
What'd she do?

423
00:39:58,105 --> 00:39:59,148
More like "Who'd she do?"

424
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,484
From what I hear,
the list is longer than my Wang.

425
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,319
That's not saying much.

426
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:05,988
They're just rumors.

427
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:08,407
Anyway, Bill had her
back in third grade.

428
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:10,785
<i>They kissed in the school play.</i>

429
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:13,412
<i>The reviews said you can't fake
that sort of passion.</i>

430
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:15,998
Now, pip-pip
and tally-ho, my good fellows,

431
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,501
I do believe this chap requires
our utmost attention.

432
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,252
Get in there, Dr. K.
Come on, fix him up.

433
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:22,338
Why don't you shut the fuck up,
Einstein, because I know what I'm doing

434
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:24,006
and I don't want you doing
the British guy with me right now.

435
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:25,758
Suck the wound. Get in there.

436
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,843
<i>Toilet and bath water travel down</i>

437
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,179
<i>the drains and into the sewer.</i>

438
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:33,933
<i>The sewer is a fun place to play
with all of your friends.</i>

439
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:38,604
<i>Just follow the water into the drains
and down into the sewers you go.</i>

440
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:43,359
<i>When you're with your friends in the
sewers, you can be as silly as a clown!</i>

441
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:45,778
<i>That's right, it's the word of the day.</i>

442
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:50,116
Hi, Daddy.

443
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:51,700
Hey, Bevvie.

444
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:53,494
Whatcha got there?

445
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,206
Just some things.

446
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:58,958
Like what?

447
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:22,982
Tell me you're still my little girl.

448
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:24,900
Yes, Daddy.

449
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,904
Good.

450
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:31,740
<i>A deep fly ball
to the left. His last at bat.</i>

451
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:33,576
<i>He scratched the foul pole.</i>

452
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:37,413
<i>Wade Boggs, of course,
leads the league in hitting so far.</i>

453
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:55,681
This is what you did.
This is what you...

454
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:57,141
This is...

455
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:31,634
<i>Lay it out.</i>

456
00:42:37,765 --> 00:42:38,766
Oh, my God.

457
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:40,976
- So easy.
- Poor tree.

458
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:42,519
So easy!

459
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:44,980
Oh, my God, that was terrible.
I win.

460
00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:46,273
- You won?
- Yeah.

461
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,484
- Did you see my loogie?
- That went the farthest!

462
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,194
- It's by distance.
- Mass. It's always been mass.

463
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:51,695
What is mass?

464
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:53,155
Who cares how far it goes?

465
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:56,283
It matters how cool it looks, like it's
green or it's white or juicy and fat.

466
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:57,493
- All right.
- Thanks for that.

467
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,827
- Who's first?
- That was terrible.

468
00:43:03,374 --> 00:43:04,416
<i>I'll go!</i>

469
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:09,797
<i>Sissies.</i>

470
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:15,094
What the fuck!

471
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:21,850
Oh, holy shit! We just got showed up
by a girl.

472
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:23,185
Do we have to do that now?

473
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:24,395
Yes.

474
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:25,729
<i>Come on!</i>

475
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,065
Oh, shit.

476
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:39,952
I already won! We already won!

477
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:43,831
They're down! Yes!

478
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:12,860
<i>Ah, fuck! What was that?</i>

479
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:14,570
Something just touched my foot
right here.

480
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:18,198
That work?

481
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:19,950
- Where are we looking?
- Right here, right here!

482
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,160
It's a turtle.

483
00:44:54,443 --> 00:44:56,570
News flash, Ben. School's out for summa!

484
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:58,280
Oh, that? That's not school stuff.

485
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:01,283
- Who sent you this?
- No one. Give it...

486
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,534
No one.

487
00:45:06,038 --> 00:45:07,122
- What's with the history project?
- Oh...

488
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:12,086
When I first moved here,
I didn't have anyone to hang out with,

489
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:14,880
so I just started spending time
in the library.

490
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:17,091
<i>You went to the library?</i>

491
00:45:18,092 --> 00:45:19,301
On purpose?

492
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:20,928
Oh, I wanna see.

493
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,307
<i>What's The Black Spot?</i>

494
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:26,725
<i>The Black Spot was a nightclub</i>

495
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:28,268
<i>that was burned down years ago
by that racist cult.</i>

496
00:45:28,811 --> 00:45:30,062
<i>The what?</i>

497
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:31,230
<i>Don't you watch</i> Geraldo?

498
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:34,441
Your hair...

499
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:38,654
Your... Your hair
is beautiful, Beverly.

500
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:39,863
Oh.

501
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:42,658
Right. Thanks.

502
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:47,996
<i>Here, pass it.</i>

503
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:54,086
Why is it all murders and missing kids?

504
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:57,131
Derry's not like any town
I've ever been in before.

505
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:00,968
They did a study once,
and it turns out

506
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:05,180
people die or disappear
six times the national average.

507
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:08,600
You read that?

508
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:11,019
<i>And that's just grown-ups.</i>

509
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,855
Kids are worse.

510
00:46:13,272 --> 00:46:14,523
Way, way worse.

511
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,069
I've got more stuff if you wanna see it.

512
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:20,404
No, no.

513
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:51,226
<i>Don't freak out, just tell us.</i>

514
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:53,729
<i>Yeah. I heard he has
a rollercoaster and a pet chimp</i>

515
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:56,690
and an old guy's fucking bones.
Yeah.

516
00:46:58,358 --> 00:46:59,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

517
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:00,819
Wow.

518
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:02,070
Cool, huh?

519
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,907
No. No, nothing cool.

520
00:47:05,115 --> 00:47:07,034
<i>There's nothing cool.</i>

521
00:47:07,743 --> 00:47:11,538
This is cool, right here.
Wait, no. No, it's not cool.

522
00:47:11,747 --> 00:47:13,040
What's that?

523
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:16,043
Oh, that? That's the charter
for Derry Township.

524
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:17,753
Nerd alert.

525
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,297
No, actually, it's really interesting.

526
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:22,257
Derry started as a beaver trapping camp.

527
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:24,593
Still is, am I right, boys?

528
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,429
Ninety-one people signed the charter
that made Derry.

529
00:47:27,596 --> 00:47:31,433
<i>But later that winter,
they all disappeared without a trace.</i>

530
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,976
The entire camp?

531
00:47:33,227 --> 00:47:34,811
<i>There were rumors of Indians,</i>

532
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:37,272
but no sign of an attack.

533
00:47:38,273 --> 00:47:41,109
<i>Everybody just thought
it was a plague or something.</i>

534
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:42,611
<i>But it's like</i>

535
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:46,281
<i>one day everybody just woke up and left.</i>

536
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:51,578
The only clue was a trail of
bloody clothes leading to the well house.

537
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,580
<i>Jesus. We can get Derry
on</i> Unsolved Mysteries.

538
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:56,875
- Let's do that. You're brilliant.
- I might be.

539
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:05,968
I don't know.

540
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:08,554
Maybe he's just trying to
make some friends, Stanley.

541
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,722
Where was the well house?

542
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,976
I don't know.
Somewhere in town, I guess.

543
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:15,394
<i>Why?</i>

544
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:16,812
Nothing.

545
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:23,151
<i>Nobody knows the trouble I've seen</i>

546
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:24,987
<i>Nobody knows my sorrow</i>

547
00:49:15,621 --> 00:49:17,623
<i>Eddie...</i>

548
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:23,462
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

549
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:27,841
Oh!

550
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:30,594
Fuck.
My mom's gonna fucking flip.

551
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,191
Do you think this will help me, Eddie?

552
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:01,750
Help! Help!

553
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,897
Where you going, Eds?

554
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:27,234
If you lived here, you'd be home by now.

555
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:31,738
Come join the clown, Eds.

556
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:33,782
<i>You'll float down here.</i>

557
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:36,118
We all float down here.

558
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:37,619
Yes, we do.

559
00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:35,594
"Your hair is winter fire...

560
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:38,722
"January embers...

561
00:51:39,473 --> 00:51:41,975
"My heart burns there, too."

562
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,989
<i>Beverly...</i>

563
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:02,078
<i>Beverly.</i>

564
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:04,956
<i>Help me.</i>

565
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:10,462
<i>Help me, please.</i>

566
00:52:14,508 --> 00:52:18,762
<i>We all want to meet you, Beverly.</i>

567
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:23,308
<i>We all float down here.</i>

568
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:30,232
Hello? Who are you?

569
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,484
<i>- I'm Veronica.</i>
<i>- Betty Ripsom.</i>

570
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:34,319
<i>Patrick Hockstetter.</i>

571
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:35,946
<i>Come closer.</i>

572
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:38,281
<i>- Wanna see?</i>
<i>- We float.</i>

573
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,408
<i>We change.</i>

574
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:51,771
<i>Daddy!</i>

575
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:53,023
Help!

576
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:54,649
Help!

577
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:31,853
The hell's going on?

578
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:36,566
The sink...

579
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,696
And the blood... It's...

580
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,740
What blood?

581
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:49,537
The sink. You don't see it?

582
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:52,082
<i>There was blood.</i>

583
00:55:00,924 --> 00:55:02,550
You worry me, Bevvie.

584
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:05,887
<i>You worry me a lot.</i>

585
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:08,890
But don't you see?

586
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:11,309
Why'd you do this to your hair?

587
00:55:12,602 --> 00:55:14,729
Makes you look like a boy.

588
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,292
Georgie.

589
00:58:27,213 --> 00:58:30,091
<i>I lost it, Billy.
Don't be mad.</i>

590
00:58:32,886 --> 00:58:35,263
I'm not mad at you.

591
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:46,024
It just floated off.

592
00:58:50,945 --> 00:58:53,448
But, Bill, if you'll come with me,

593
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:55,742
you'll float, too.

594
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,118
Georgie.

595
00:58:58,286 --> 00:59:00,079
You'll float, too.
You'll float, too.

596
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:02,248
<i>You'll float, too.</i>

597
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:04,209
- You'll float, too.
- You'll float, too.

598
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:07,420
<i>You'll float, too. You'll float, too.</i>

599
00:59:07,629 --> 00:59:08,922
<i>You'll float, too.</i>

600
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:12,717
You'll float, too!
You'll float, too!

601
00:59:12,926 --> 00:59:14,302
You'll float, too!

602
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:15,887
You'll float, too!

603
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:18,389
You'll float, too!

604
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:35,323
<i>No, we gotta go
through the alleyway.</i>

605
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:36,574
<i>The alley takes way too long.</i>

606
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:38,117
<i>No, the alley is so much faster.</i>

607
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:39,661
<i>The alley is more dangerous
and it's disgusting.</i>

608
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:40,954
<i>How is it more dangerous?</i>

609
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,497
<i>It smells like piss and it's gross.</i>

610
00:59:42,664 --> 00:59:44,332
<i>- Just take the side streets for once.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

611
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:47,168
<i>The side streets are the same.
They smell like piss and shit.</i>

612
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:49,420
<i>Okay, okay. Can you just tell me
what she said exactly?</i>

613
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:50,630
<i>She didn't say anything.</i>

614
00:59:50,797 --> 00:59:51,839
<i>She just said that
you guys need to hurry over.</i>

615
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:53,341
She didn't say
anything. Okay. Okay.

616
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,094
You made it. I...

617
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:57,845
I need to show you something.

618
00:59:58,096 --> 00:59:59,180
What is it?

619
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:00,473
More than we saw at the quarry?

620
01:00:00,682 --> 01:00:02,016
Shut up! Just shut up, Richie.

621
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,187
My dad will kill me if he finds out
I had boys in the apartment.

622
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,856
Then we'll leave a lookout.

623
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:11,192
Richie, stay here.

624
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:13,653
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What if her dad comes back?

625
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:16,823
Do what you always do. Start talking.

626
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:20,118
It is a gift.

627
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:30,295
In there.

628
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:33,214
<i>What is it?</i>

629
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:34,674
<i>You'll see.</i>

630
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:36,551
Are you taking us
to your bathroom?

631
01:00:36,718 --> 01:00:39,012
I just want you to know that 89%
of the worst accidents in homes

632
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,055
are caused in bathrooms.

633
01:00:41,306 --> 01:00:44,017
And, I mean, that's where
all the bacteria and fungi are

634
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:46,394
and it's not a really sanitary place...

635
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,232
<i>I knew it!</i>

636
01:00:51,399 --> 01:00:52,400
<i>You see it?</i>

637
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,152
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- What...</i>

638
01:00:54,569 --> 01:00:55,737
<i>What happened in here?</i>

639
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:59,574
My dad couldn't see it.
I thought I might be crazy.

640
01:01:00,575 --> 01:01:03,911
<i>Well, if you're crazy,
then we're all crazy.</i>

641
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:07,248
We can't leave it like this.

642
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:22,156
<i>All right, so you've</i>

643
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:23,491
<i>never been
to the Derry Summer Fair?</i>

644
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:25,827
No, I don't think so.

645
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:28,246
<i>Not that I know of.</i>

646
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:32,166
<i>Well, I go there every year,</i>

647
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:35,503
<i>but I was there one time with Richie and
technically won 'cause I hit the target.</i>

648
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:39,340
<i>But there were so many prizes,
I didn't know which to pick.</i>

649
01:02:43,845 --> 01:02:46,013
It's not true, you know.

650
01:02:46,264 --> 01:02:47,598
What they say about me.

651
01:02:50,268 --> 01:02:52,520
I was only ever kissed by one guy.

652
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:57,316
It was a long time ago.

653
01:02:58,359 --> 01:03:00,319
It was a nice kiss though.

654
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:06,868
"January embers."

655
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:12,540
Was that in the play?

656
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:16,294
No, the poem.

657
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:17,837
Oh...

658
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:21,215
Oh,
I don't really know much poetry.

659
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:26,471
Oh. I was just...

660
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:29,640
Never mind then.

661
01:03:33,728 --> 01:03:34,896
Um...

662
01:03:35,688 --> 01:03:38,566
Just so you know, I...

663
01:03:38,733 --> 01:03:40,818
I never believed any of the rumors.

664
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:45,072
And none of us Losers do.

665
01:03:47,575 --> 01:03:48,868
We like hanging with you.

666
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:52,747
Thanks.

667
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:54,916
You shouldn't thank us too much.

668
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:57,168
Hanging out with us
makes you a Loser, too.

669
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:00,254
I can take that.

670
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:06,928
No, I love being
your personal doorman, really.

671
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:08,721
Could you idiots have taken any longer?

672
01:04:08,888 --> 01:04:10,765
- All right, shut up, Richie.
- Yeah, shut up, Richie.

673
01:04:10,932 --> 01:04:13,351
Oh, okay, trash the trashmouth,
I get it.

674
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:15,436
Hey, I wasn't the one
scrubbing the bathroom floor

675
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:18,940
and imagining that her sink went all
Eddie's mom's vagina on Halloween.

676
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:21,108
She didn't imagine it.

677
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:25,613
I...

678
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,199
I saw something, too.

679
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:30,409
You saw blood, too?

680
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:33,454
Not blood.

681
01:04:35,248 --> 01:04:39,293
I saw Georgie.

682
01:04:40,795 --> 01:04:42,797
It seemed so real.

683
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:45,049
I mean, it seemed like him,
but there was this...

684
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:46,968
The clown.

685
01:04:52,098 --> 01:04:53,391
Yeah, I saw him, too.

686
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:02,984
Wait, can only virgins see this stuff?

687
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,735
Is that why I'm not seeing this shit?

688
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:09,282
<i>Oh, shit,
that's Belch Huggins' car.</i>

689
01:05:10,283 --> 01:05:11,909
- We should probably get outta here.
- Yeah.

690
01:05:12,118 --> 01:05:14,495
Wait, isn't that
the homeschooled kid's bike?

691
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:15,746
<i>Yeah, that's Mike's.</i>

692
01:05:17,832 --> 01:05:19,333
We have to help him.

693
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,751
We should?

694
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:21,961
Yes.

695
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:30,678
<i>Come on.</i>

696
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:33,180
<i>Eat that meat!</i>

697
01:05:33,347 --> 01:05:34,849
- Eat it, bitch!
- You little fucker!

698
01:05:35,016 --> 01:05:36,642
- Bitch!
- Motherfucker!

699
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:38,102
<i>- Eat it, you little bitch!</i>
<i>- Pussy!</i>

700
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:40,354
<i>Fucking...</i>

701
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:41,689
<i>Whatcha gonna do, huh?</i>

702
01:05:41,856 --> 01:05:42,857
Get up!

703
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:47,278
Get the fuck up!

704
01:05:48,613 --> 01:05:49,697
You little fucker!

705
01:05:58,706 --> 01:05:59,790
Come on, Henry, smack him!

706
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:01,042
You little bitch.

707
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:06,380
- Nice throw.
- Thanks.

708
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:13,971
<i>You losers
are trying too hard.</i>

709
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:15,848
She'll do you.

710
01:06:16,057 --> 01:06:17,850
<i>You just gotta ask nicely,</i>

711
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,561
like I did.

712
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:27,985
What the fuck?

713
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:32,907
<i>Come on, get 'em! Fuck!</i>

714
01:06:33,074 --> 01:06:34,492
Rock war!

715
01:06:36,535 --> 01:06:38,371
- Get 'em!
- Watch out!

716
01:06:38,913 --> 01:06:40,665
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

717
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,378
Eddie!

718
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:49,590
<i>- Fuck outta here!</i>
- Ow!

719
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:53,386
Ah, shit!

720
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:56,180
Fuck you, bitch!

721
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:01,268
Come on, guys!
Let's get 'em!

722
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:02,853
- Fuck this.
<i>- Fuck out of here.</i>

723
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,605
<i>Fuck you, losers!</i>

724
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:26,252
Go blow your dad,
you mullet-wearing asshole!

725
01:07:35,428 --> 01:07:37,138
Thanks, guys,
but you shouldn't have done that.

726
01:07:37,388 --> 01:07:38,931
They'll be after you guys, too, now.

727
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:42,643
Oh, no, no, no. Bowers?
He's always after us.

728
01:07:43,102 --> 01:07:47,148
I guess that's one thing
we all have in common.

729
01:07:47,481 --> 01:07:50,776
Yeah, Homeschool.
Welcome to the Losers' Club.

730
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:55,865
<i>Right there.</i>

731
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:01,787
<i>They say they found
part of his hand</i>

732
01:08:01,996 --> 01:08:03,038
<i>all chewed up near the Standpipe.</i>

733
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,542
He asked to borrow a pencil once.

734
01:08:10,755 --> 01:08:13,174
It's like she's been forgotten

735
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:15,551
because Corcoran's missing.

736
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:18,345
Is it ever gonna end?

737
01:08:18,554 --> 01:08:19,764
What the fuck, dude?

738
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:21,557
What are you guys talking about?

739
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:23,809
What they always talk about.

740
01:08:24,018 --> 01:08:25,436
I actually think it will end.

741
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:27,146
For a little while, at least.

742
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:28,355
What do you mean?

743
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:31,358
So I was going over
all my Derry research

744
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:33,152
and I charted out all the big events.

745
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,404
The Ironworks explosion in 1908,

746
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:37,323
the Bradley Gang in '35,

747
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:39,575
and The Black Spot in '62.

748
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:41,702
And now kids being...

749
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,333
I realized this stuff seems to happen...

750
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,126
Every 27 years.

751
01:08:53,255 --> 01:08:54,632
<i>Okay, so, let me get this straight.</i>

752
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,092
<i>It comes out from wherever
to eat kids for, like, a year?</i>

753
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:59,178
<i>And then what?
It just goes into hibernation?</i>

754
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:01,847
Maybe it's like...
What do you call it?

755
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:03,224
Cicadas.

756
01:09:03,432 --> 01:09:05,518
You know, the bugs that come out
once every 17 years.

757
01:09:06,602 --> 01:09:08,437
My grandfather thinks
this town is cursed.

758
01:09:09,438 --> 01:09:10,439
<i>He says that</i>

759
01:09:10,815 --> 01:09:12,566
all the bad things
that happen in this town

760
01:09:12,733 --> 01:09:14,401
are because of one thing.

761
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:17,321
An evil thing that feeds off
the people of Derry.

762
01:09:17,947 --> 01:09:19,740
But it can't be one thing.

763
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:22,409
We all saw something different.

764
01:09:23,077 --> 01:09:24,078
<i>Maybe.</i>

765
01:09:24,286 --> 01:09:26,664
Or maybe It knows what scares us most
and that's what we see.

766
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:28,916
I saw a leper.

767
01:09:30,084 --> 01:09:32,169
He was like a walking infection.

768
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,004
But you didn't.

769
01:09:35,756 --> 01:09:37,341
Because it isn't real.

770
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,093
<i>None of this is.</i>

771
01:09:39,844 --> 01:09:41,095
Not Eddie's leper

772
01:09:41,262 --> 01:09:43,430
or Bill seeing Georgie

773
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:46,183
or the woman I keep seeing.

774
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,351
She hot?

775
01:09:49,103 --> 01:09:50,187
No, Richie.

776
01:09:50,938 --> 01:09:51,939
She's not hot.

777
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:55,109
Her face is all messed up.

778
01:09:56,527 --> 01:09:59,029
<i>None of this makes any sense.</i>

779
01:09:59,697 --> 01:10:01,282
They're all like bad dreams.

780
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:06,120
I don't think so. I know the difference
between a bad dream and real life, okay?

781
01:10:06,996 --> 01:10:09,290
What'd you see?
You saw something, too?

782
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:10,499
<i>Yes.</i>

783
01:10:12,293 --> 01:10:14,837
Do you guys know that burned-down house
on Harris Avenue?

784
01:10:16,547 --> 01:10:18,716
I was inside when it burned down.

785
01:10:22,011 --> 01:10:23,012
Before I was rescued,

786
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:26,640
my mom and dad were trapped
in the next room over from me.

787
01:10:26,849 --> 01:10:31,478
They were pushing
and pounding on the door,

788
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:35,232
trying to get to me.

789
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:36,483
<i>Hurry, son!</i>

790
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:37,902
<i>It burns!</i>

791
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:40,195
But it was too hot.

792
01:10:41,906 --> 01:10:43,908
When the firemen finally found them,

793
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:51,832
the skin on their hands had
melted down to the bone.

794
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:56,253
We're all afraid of something.

795
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,088
Got that right.

796
01:10:58,756 --> 01:11:00,674
<i>Why, Rich?
What are you afraid of?</i>

797
01:11:04,178 --> 01:11:05,554
Clowns.

798
01:11:33,832 --> 01:11:34,875
Okay.

799
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:37,252
Look.

800
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:42,049
<i>That's where Georgie disappeared.</i>

801
01:11:42,216 --> 01:11:44,051
<i>There's the Ironworks.</i>

802
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:45,803
<i>And The Black Spot.</i>

803
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,057
Everywhere it happens,
it's all connected by the sewers.

804
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:53,727
And they all meet up at the--

805
01:11:53,936 --> 01:11:55,104
The well house.

806
01:11:58,315 --> 01:11:59,400
It's in the house on Neibolt Street.

807
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:03,570
You mean that creepy-ass house where
all the junkies and hobos like to sleep?

808
01:12:04,113 --> 01:12:06,115
<i>I hate that place.</i>

809
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,784
It always feels like it's watching me.

810
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:10,452
<i>That's where I saw It.</i>

811
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:12,871
That's where I saw the clown.

812
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:17,292
That's where It lives.

813
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:21,588
<i>I can't imagine anything
ever wanting to live there.</i>

814
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:23,048
Can we stop talking about this?

815
01:12:23,257 --> 01:12:25,134
I can barely breathe.

816
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:26,552
<i>This is summer.</i>

817
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,387
We're kids. I can barely breathe.

818
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:29,930
I'm up here having
a fucking asthma attack.

819
01:12:30,431 --> 01:12:31,765
I'm not doing this.

820
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:33,976
What the hell? Put the map back.

821
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:35,519
Mmm-mmm.

822
01:12:42,401 --> 01:12:43,777
What happened?

823
01:12:44,236 --> 01:12:45,446
What's going on?

824
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,489
I got it. Hold on.

825
01:12:49,283 --> 01:12:50,325
Guys.

826
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:57,916
Georgie.

827
01:12:59,293 --> 01:13:00,335
<i>Bill?</i>

828
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,520
<i>What the fuck?</i>

829
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:20,481
<i>It's It!</i>

830
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:24,818
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?

831
01:13:25,277 --> 01:13:26,320
I don't fucking know!

832
01:13:30,866 --> 01:13:32,659
Turn it off! Turn it off!

833
01:13:32,826 --> 01:13:34,661
Yeah. Yeah,
turn it off. Turn it off!

834
01:13:53,847 --> 01:13:55,057
<i>Run, Stanley!</i>

835
01:13:57,226 --> 01:13:58,519
What is it?

836
01:13:58,811 --> 01:13:59,853
<i>What the fuck?</i>

837
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:16,036
Thanks, Ben.

838
01:14:18,247 --> 01:14:19,540
It saw us.

839
01:14:20,707 --> 01:14:22,209
It saw us, and it knows where we are.

840
01:14:22,835 --> 01:14:23,836
It always did.

841
01:14:24,211 --> 01:14:25,921
So, let's go.

842
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:27,756
Go?

843
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:29,424
Go where?

844
01:14:29,675 --> 01:14:30,717
Neibolt.

845
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,346
That's where Georgie is.

846
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,889
After that?

847
01:14:36,557 --> 01:14:38,892
Yeah, it's summer.
We should be outside.

848
01:14:39,059 --> 01:14:41,937
If you say it's summer
one more fucking time...

849
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:48,652
<i>Bill!</i>

850
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:50,904
Wait!

851
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:24,688
"He thrusts his fists

852
01:15:24,897 --> 01:15:26,857
"against the posts

853
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:30,235
"and still insists he sees..."

854
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:32,529
Bill!

855
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:35,324
Bill, you can't go in there.

856
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:36,533
This is crazy.

857
01:15:36,742 --> 01:15:38,535
Look, you don't have to come in with me.

858
01:15:39,453 --> 01:15:42,789
But what happens when
another Georgie goes missing?

859
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:48,045
Or another Betty?
Or another Ed Corcoran? Or one of us?

860
01:15:48,754 --> 01:15:52,132
Are you just gonna pretend it isn't
happening like everyone else in this town?

861
01:15:53,217 --> 01:15:55,093
Because I can't.

862
01:15:57,638 --> 01:16:01,975
I go home, and all I see is
that Georgie isn't there.

863
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:06,980
His clothes, his toys,
his stupid stuffed animals, but...

864
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:09,149
<i>He isn't.</i>

865
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:12,736
So walking into this house,

866
01:16:15,656 --> 01:16:17,407
for me,

867
01:16:17,616 --> 01:16:20,118
it's easier
than walking into my own.

868
01:16:24,498 --> 01:16:25,499
<i>Wow.</i>

869
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:26,750
<i>What?</i>

870
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:28,460
He didn't stutter once.

871
01:16:32,506 --> 01:16:33,632
Wait!

872
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:36,218
Um...

873
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:39,805
Shouldn't we have some people
keep watch?

874
01:16:42,015 --> 01:16:44,685
You know, just in case
something bad happens?

875
01:16:47,813 --> 01:16:50,315
Who wants to stay out here?

876
01:16:57,656 --> 01:16:58,657
Fuck.

877
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:09,501
I can't believe
I pulled the short straw.

878
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:12,379
<i>You guys are lucky
you're not measuring dicks.</i>

879
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:14,006
<i>Shut up, Richie.</i>

880
01:17:17,509 --> 01:17:19,052
<i>I can smell it.</i>

881
01:17:19,636 --> 01:17:21,138
Don't breathe through your mouth.

882
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:22,347
How come?

883
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:24,474
Because then you're eating it.

884
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:52,252
What?

885
01:17:53,003 --> 01:17:54,713
It... It says I'm missing.

886
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:57,883
You're not missing, Richie.

887
01:17:58,091 --> 01:17:59,426
"Police department,
City of Derry."

888
01:17:59,676 --> 01:18:02,220
That's my shirt. That's my hair.
That's my face.

889
01:18:02,429 --> 01:18:03,430
Calm down, this isn't real.

890
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,890
That's my name. That's my age!
That's the date!

891
01:18:05,098 --> 01:18:06,099
It can't be real, Richie.

892
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:07,768
No, it says it! What the fuck?

893
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:10,437
- Am I missing? Am I gonna go missing?
- Calm down. Calm down.

894
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,522
Look at me, Richie. Look at me.

895
01:18:13,607 --> 01:18:15,442
That... That isn't real.

896
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:17,611
It's playing tricks on you.

897
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:19,780
<i>Hello?</i>

898
01:18:23,075 --> 01:18:24,576
<i>Hello?</i>

899
01:18:28,789 --> 01:18:30,624
<i>Help me, please!</i>

900
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,161
Betty?

901
01:19:08,745 --> 01:19:09,746
Ripsom?

902
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:21,466
<i>Eddie...</i>

903
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:26,513
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

904
01:19:28,849 --> 01:19:30,350
Guys, can you hear that?

905
01:19:51,705 --> 01:19:54,791
<i>She was just here.
Where the fuck did she go?</i>

906
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:56,376
Guys.

907
01:20:00,881 --> 01:20:02,632
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

908
01:20:04,801 --> 01:20:06,219
Guys. Guys!

909
01:20:07,554 --> 01:20:09,890
<i>- Guys! Guys!</i>
- What? Eddie?

910
01:20:11,391 --> 01:20:13,268
What the fuck?

911
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:25,363
Time to take
your pill, Eddie.

912
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:41,421
- Eddie. Open the door!
<i>- Richie.</i>

913
01:20:42,297 --> 01:20:43,465
<i>You okay?</i>

914
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:45,425
<i>Eddie, what's going on?</i>

915
01:20:45,759 --> 01:20:46,760
Eds.

916
01:20:47,594 --> 01:20:48,595
<i>Eddie.</i>

917
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:50,263
<i>Come here, Richie.</i>

918
01:20:50,764 --> 01:20:51,806
Eddie.

919
01:20:54,392 --> 01:20:55,435
<i>Eddie.</i>

920
01:21:00,815 --> 01:21:02,150
Eddie.

921
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:04,152
Where the fuck are you?

922
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:07,322
<i>We're not playing hide-and-seek, dipshit.</i>

923
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:11,952
Richie?

924
01:21:14,788 --> 01:21:16,289
Richie! Richie!

925
01:21:16,456 --> 01:21:17,499
Bill, come on, open the door.

926
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:18,750
<i>It won't open!</i>

927
01:21:18,917 --> 01:21:20,460
<i>- What's going on? Richie!</i>
- I can't!

928
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:21,670
<i>Open the door, Rich.</i>

929
01:21:27,801 --> 01:21:28,802
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

930
01:21:58,498 --> 01:21:59,833
Stupid clowns.

931
01:22:07,716 --> 01:22:08,883
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

932
01:22:37,329 --> 01:22:38,330
<i>Ugh!</i>

933
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:50,383
Beep-beep, Richie.

934
01:22:55,889 --> 01:22:56,973
Let's get outta here.

935
01:23:04,022 --> 01:23:05,357
You wanna play loogie?

936
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:56,574
Time to float.

937
01:24:34,446 --> 01:24:35,447
<i>Where's my shoe?</i>

938
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:41,494
Where the fuck were her legs?

939
01:24:42,454 --> 01:24:44,330
Holy shit, what the fuck was that?

940
01:24:44,497 --> 01:24:45,498
This isn't real.

941
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:46,958
Remember the missing kid poster.

942
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:48,710
That wasn't real, so this isn't real.

943
01:24:50,378 --> 01:24:53,506
Tasty, tasty, beautiful fear.

944
01:24:56,885 --> 01:24:57,886
Come on. Ready?

945
01:24:58,052 --> 01:24:59,095
<i>No!</i>

946
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:02,515
No.

947
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:07,395
No, no!

948
01:25:08,563 --> 01:25:09,814
Oh, thank fuck.

949
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:11,357
<i>- Where's Eddie?</i>
<i>- Help!</i>

950
01:25:11,691 --> 01:25:13,026
<i>Help!</i>

951
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:16,362
Eddie!

952
01:25:18,323 --> 01:25:19,908
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

953
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:21,159
Eddie!

954
01:25:23,411 --> 01:25:25,705
This isn't real enough for you, Billy?

955
01:25:27,165 --> 01:25:28,708
I'm not real enough for you?

956
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,418
Oh, shit.

957
01:25:30,668 --> 01:25:33,046
It was real enough for Georgie.

958
01:25:36,466 --> 01:25:37,467
Holy shit!

959
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,893
- Get Eddie!
- Get Eddie!

960
01:25:50,355 --> 01:25:52,690
Oh, fuck! We gotta get out of here!

961
01:25:59,364 --> 01:26:00,615
<i>Get Eddie. Let's go!</i>

962
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:01,866
<i>Guys, watch out!</i>

963
01:26:02,075 --> 01:26:03,952
- No, no, no, no!
- Eddie, look at me!

964
01:26:04,202 --> 01:26:06,037
He's gonna get us!
Guys!

965
01:26:06,246 --> 01:26:07,580
<i>No!</i>

966
01:26:12,919 --> 01:26:14,587
<i>Ben!</i>

967
01:26:14,796 --> 01:26:15,797
Ben!

968
01:26:22,303 --> 01:26:23,429
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

969
01:26:24,514 --> 01:26:25,932
Don't let him get away!

970
01:26:36,442 --> 01:26:37,777
<i>Bill,
we have to help Eddie!</i>

971
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:39,612
No! No!

972
01:26:40,446 --> 01:26:41,948
I'm gonna snap your arm
into place.

973
01:26:42,115 --> 01:26:43,199
Rich, do not fucking touch me.

974
01:26:43,449 --> 01:26:46,786
- Okay, one, two, three.
- Do not touch me!

975
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:50,123
Holy shit!

976
01:26:52,292 --> 01:26:54,627
You. You did this.

977
01:26:55,044 --> 01:26:56,713
You know how delicate he is.

978
01:26:56,963 --> 01:26:59,883
- We were attacked, Mrs. K.
- No. Don't.

979
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,635
Don't try and blame anyone else.

980
01:27:05,221 --> 01:27:06,514
- Let me help.
- Get back!

981
01:27:08,892 --> 01:27:10,810
Oh, I've heard of you, Miss Marsh.

982
01:27:11,019 --> 01:27:14,022
And I don't want a dirty girl like you
touching my son.

983
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:17,901
Mrs. K, I...

984
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:21,154
No! You are all monsters.
All of you.

985
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:25,325
And Eddie is done with you.
Do you hear? Done!

986
01:27:50,266 --> 01:27:51,267
I saw the well.

987
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:53,436
We know where it is

988
01:27:53,686 --> 01:27:56,272
and next time we'll be better prepared.

989
01:27:56,522 --> 01:27:57,523
No!

990
01:27:58,358 --> 01:27:59,525
No next time, Bill.

991
01:28:00,902 --> 01:28:02,695
- You're insane.
<i>- Why?</i>

992
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:05,406
We all know no one else
is going to do anything.

993
01:28:05,615 --> 01:28:07,867
Eddie was nearly killed!
And look at this motherfucker.

994
01:28:08,076 --> 01:28:09,911
He's leaking Hamburger Helper!

995
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:11,204
<i>We can't pretend
it's gonna go away.</i>

996
01:28:11,371 --> 01:28:14,123
Ben, you said it yourself,
It comes back every 27 years.

997
01:28:14,374 --> 01:28:17,210
Fine! I'll be 40 and far away from here.

998
01:28:18,252 --> 01:28:20,171
I thought you said you wanted to
get out of this town, too.

999
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:23,216
Because I wanna run towards something.
Not away.

1000
01:28:23,883 --> 01:28:25,843
I'm sorry, who invited Molly Ringwald
into the group?

1001
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:29,180
- Richie--
- I'm just saying, let's face facts.

1002
01:28:29,389 --> 01:28:30,390
Real world.

1003
01:28:30,598 --> 01:28:33,226
Georgie is dead.
Stop trying to get us killed, too.

1004
01:28:33,434 --> 01:28:34,435
Georgie's not dead.

1005
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:38,231
You couldn't save him,
but you can still save yourself.

1006
01:28:38,731 --> 01:28:41,234
No, take it back.

1007
01:28:43,069 --> 01:28:46,239
You're scared and we all are,
but take it back!

1008
01:28:48,866 --> 01:28:49,867
Bill!

1009
01:28:51,577 --> 01:28:53,538
You're just a bunch of losers!

1010
01:28:53,746 --> 01:28:54,914
- Fuck off!
- Richie, stop.

1011
01:28:55,123 --> 01:28:57,041
You're just a bunch of losers
and you'll get yourselves killed

1012
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:59,377
- trying to catch a fucking stupid clown.
- Stop!

1013
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:04,132
This is what It wants.

1014
01:29:04,382 --> 01:29:05,633
It wants to divide us.

1015
01:29:08,594 --> 01:29:11,097
We were all together when we hurt It.

1016
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:13,266
That's why we're still alive.

1017
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:16,102
Yeah? Well, I plan to keep it that way.

1018
01:29:27,947 --> 01:29:29,949
- Mike...
- Guys...

1019
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:33,244
I can't do this.

1020
01:29:34,912 --> 01:29:36,497
My granddad was right.

1021
01:29:36,789 --> 01:29:39,625
I'm an outsider.
Gotta stay that way.

1022
01:30:38,309 --> 01:30:39,977
- Yeah! Bonus!
- Yeah, there we go.

1023
01:30:40,186 --> 01:30:41,646
Put the next target out there.

1024
01:30:53,783 --> 01:30:55,451
<i>Just hold it.</i>

1025
01:30:58,037 --> 01:30:59,872
What the hell's going on here?

1026
01:31:02,542 --> 01:31:05,711
Just cleaning your gun, like you asked.

1027
01:31:06,212 --> 01:31:08,381
You're cleaning my gun, huh?

1028
01:31:12,135 --> 01:31:14,220
- Dad...
- Hey!

1029
01:31:25,481 --> 01:31:27,191
Look at him now, boys.

1030
01:31:28,317 --> 01:31:31,863
Ain't nothing like a little fear
to make a paper man crumble.

1031
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:43,499
<i>Here for the refills, Eddie?</i>

1032
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:44,667
Yeah.

1033
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:54,260
<i>You know
it's all bullshit, right?</i>

1034
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:55,678
What is?

1035
01:31:56,429 --> 01:31:57,430
Your medication.

1036
01:31:58,014 --> 01:31:59,307
<i>They're placebos.</i>

1037
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:00,516
What's placebo mean?

1038
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:02,185
Placebo means bullshit.

1039
01:32:05,188 --> 01:32:06,439
No friends, huh?

1040
01:32:07,398 --> 01:32:08,399
<i>Your cast.</i>

1041
01:32:08,941 --> 01:32:10,484
No signatures or anything?

1042
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:11,944
So sad.

1043
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:14,822
I didn't want it to get dirty.

1044
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:17,074
I'll sign it for you.

1045
01:32:34,467 --> 01:32:35,843
You okay, Henry?

1046
01:33:45,579 --> 01:33:48,749
<i>And this is my most
favorite part of the afternoon.</i>

1047
01:33:48,958 --> 01:33:51,836
<i>Getting to know all about
so many of you.</i>

1048
01:33:52,086 --> 01:33:54,005
<i>Is there someone here
that wants to share with us</i>

1049
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:55,965
<i>- what they most enjoyed about today?</i>
<i>- Me!</i>

1050
01:33:56,173 --> 01:33:57,258
<i>How about you?</i>

1051
01:33:57,466 --> 01:33:58,592
<i>I liked seeing the clown.</i>

1052
01:33:58,801 --> 01:34:00,553
<i>You did?
You liked the clown?</i>

1053
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:01,762
<i>Yes!</i>

1054
01:34:01,929 --> 01:34:03,514
<i>What about the rest of you?</i>

1055
01:34:03,723 --> 01:34:05,016
<i>I liked when the bubbles float.</i>

1056
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:07,101
<i>You did? Me too.</i>

1057
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:09,562
<i>I just love watching things float.</i>

1058
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:10,771
<i>We all float.</i>

1059
01:34:10,938 --> 01:34:12,148
<i>That's right.</i>

1060
01:34:12,356 --> 01:34:14,442
<i>And you will, too, Henry.</i>

1061
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:16,485
<i>Make it a wonderful day.</i>

1062
01:34:16,694 --> 01:34:17,987
<i>Kill him.</i>

1063
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:21,073
<i>Kill him. Kill him.</i>

1064
01:34:21,657 --> 01:34:23,367
<i>Kill him. Kill him.</i>

1065
01:34:23,576 --> 01:34:26,454
<i>Kill him. Kill him.</i>

1066
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:30,666
<i>Oh, no.
Give a big round of applause!</i>

1067
01:34:37,715 --> 01:34:39,258
<i>Well done, Henry.</i>

1068
01:34:39,467 --> 01:34:42,636
<i>Kill them all. Kill them all.</i>

1069
01:34:42,887 --> 01:34:44,305
<i>Kill them all!</i>

1070
01:34:44,472 --> 01:34:45,973
<i>Kill them all!</i>

1071
01:34:46,182 --> 01:34:48,934
<i>Kill them all! Kill them all!
Kill them all!</i>

1072
01:34:51,479 --> 01:34:53,481
<i>Kill them all! Kill them all!
Kill them all!</i>

1073
01:35:15,419 --> 01:35:17,797
<i>Where are you
sneaking off to?</i>

1074
01:35:23,803 --> 01:35:25,429
Nowhere, Daddy.

1075
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:29,225
You're looking prettied up.

1076
01:35:30,434 --> 01:35:32,561
I'm not prettied up, Daddy.
I wear this almost every day.

1077
01:35:33,729 --> 01:35:35,022
Come.

1078
01:35:50,704 --> 01:35:53,374
<i>You know I worry about you, Bevvie.</i>

1079
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:55,126
I know.

1080
01:35:55,626 --> 01:36:00,423
People in town have been
saying some things to me about you.

1081
01:36:01,465 --> 01:36:04,510
Sneaking around all summer long
with a bunch of boys.

1082
01:36:05,094 --> 01:36:06,887
<i>The only girl in the pack.</i>

1083
01:36:07,096 --> 01:36:09,515
They're just friends, I swear.

1084
01:36:09,807 --> 01:36:15,563
I know what's in boys' minds
when they look at you, Bevvie.

1085
01:36:15,771 --> 01:36:17,857
I know all too well.

1086
01:36:18,065 --> 01:36:19,859
My hand...

1087
01:36:20,067 --> 01:36:25,489
Are you doing womanly things
down in the woods with those boys?

1088
01:36:25,698 --> 01:36:29,285
No, no, no, nothing.
You don't have to worry. I promise.

1089
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:30,911
What's this?

1090
01:36:32,413 --> 01:36:34,540
It's nothing. It's just a poem.

1091
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:37,334
Just a poem?

1092
01:36:37,543 --> 01:36:39,879
But you had to hide it
in your underwear drawer.

1093
01:36:40,754 --> 01:36:43,466
Why would you have to hide it there?

1094
01:36:45,718 --> 01:36:47,178
Are you still my girl?

1095
01:36:47,595 --> 01:36:48,596
No.

1096
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:49,889
What did you say?

1097
01:36:50,431 --> 01:36:52,308
I said, no!

1098
01:36:55,394 --> 01:36:56,479
No!

1099
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,773
Get away, no!

1100
01:37:01,692 --> 01:37:03,027
Get off!

1101
01:37:03,486 --> 01:37:04,570
No!

1102
01:37:07,364 --> 01:37:10,910
Those boys.
Do they know that you're my--

1103
01:38:36,245 --> 01:38:37,788
Beverly?

1104
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:04,356
Beverly!

1105
01:39:13,032 --> 01:39:15,326
- Richie.
- What do you want?

1106
01:39:15,909 --> 01:39:18,203
<i>See that guy I'm hitting?
I'm pretending it's you.</i>

1107
01:39:19,496 --> 01:39:20,623
It got Beverly.

1108
01:39:20,831 --> 01:39:22,291
What are you talking about?

1109
01:39:23,751 --> 01:39:25,127
It, Richie.

1110
01:39:25,836 --> 01:39:27,504
It got Beverly.

1111
01:39:42,311 --> 01:39:43,437
Hello?

1112
01:39:46,357 --> 01:39:47,608
Okay.

1113
01:39:49,318 --> 01:39:50,694
I'll meet you there.

1114
01:39:57,368 --> 01:39:58,827
And just where do you think
you're off to?

1115
01:39:59,203 --> 01:40:00,329
Out with my friends.

1116
01:40:01,205 --> 01:40:03,540
Sweetie, you can't go.

1117
01:40:03,749 --> 01:40:05,417
You're getting over
your sickness, remember?

1118
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:07,628
My sickness?

1119
01:40:07,836 --> 01:40:09,755
Okay, what sickness, Ma?

1120
01:40:12,174 --> 01:40:14,593
You know what these are?
They're gazebos!

1121
01:40:14,802 --> 01:40:15,969
They're bullshit!

1122
01:40:22,393 --> 01:40:24,269
They help you, Eddie.

1123
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:26,897
I had to protect you.

1124
01:40:27,106 --> 01:40:28,440
Protect me?

1125
01:40:28,649 --> 01:40:31,610
By lying to me? By keeping me locked
inside this hellhole?

1126
01:40:31,819 --> 01:40:33,195
I'm sorry but the only people that were

1127
01:40:33,362 --> 01:40:35,614
actually trying to protect me
were my friends.

1128
01:40:35,864 --> 01:40:38,033
And you made me turn my back on them
when I really needed them.

1129
01:40:38,242 --> 01:40:39,243
So I'm going.

1130
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:42,204
Eddie. Eddie. No.

1131
01:40:42,413 --> 01:40:43,455
You get back here.

1132
01:40:43,664 --> 01:40:45,457
- Sorry, Mom, I gotta go save my friends.
- Eddie!

1133
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:47,292
Don't do this to me, Eddie!

1134
01:41:12,943 --> 01:41:14,111
Guys, spikes.

1135
01:42:03,619 --> 01:42:04,620
Stan?

1136
01:42:07,164 --> 01:42:08,957
Stan, we all have to go.

1137
01:42:09,166 --> 01:42:11,293
<i>Beverly was right.</i>

1138
01:42:12,252 --> 01:42:16,006
If we split up like last time,
that clown will kill us one by one.

1139
01:42:17,007 --> 01:42:19,843
<i>But if we stick together,</i>

1140
01:42:21,345 --> 01:42:22,638
all of us,

1141
01:42:24,389 --> 01:42:25,891
we'll win.

1142
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:27,768
<i>I promise.</i>

1143
01:42:54,419 --> 01:42:57,130
Hey, Eddie, you got a quarter?

1144
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:00,843
I wouldn't want to make a wish
in that fucking thing.

1145
01:43:05,848 --> 01:43:07,516
Beverly?

1146
01:43:07,724 --> 01:43:08,934
How are we supposed to
get down there?

1147
01:43:11,019 --> 01:43:12,521
All right. Come on.

1148
01:43:29,496 --> 01:43:30,789
All right.

1149
01:45:11,139 --> 01:45:13,100
Guys, guys. Help.

1150
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:16,687
- All right, buddy?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1151
01:45:21,441 --> 01:45:24,236
<i>Step right up,
Beverly. Step right up.</i>

1152
01:45:25,654 --> 01:45:29,449
<i>Come change. Come float.
You'll laugh. You'll cry.</i>

1153
01:45:29,658 --> 01:45:33,078
<i>You'll cheer. You'll die.</i>

1154
01:45:33,996 --> 01:45:37,833
<i>Introducing Pennywise the Dancing Clown.</i>

1155
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:14,745
I'm not afraid of you.

1156
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:23,211
You will be.

1157
01:46:36,058 --> 01:46:38,477
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

1158
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:49,571
Ahhh!

1159
01:46:51,031 --> 01:46:52,032
Die!

1160
01:46:54,201 --> 01:46:55,243
Mike!

1161
01:46:55,452 --> 01:46:56,912
- Mike!
- Mike!

1162
01:46:57,579 --> 01:46:59,289
<i>You okay? Mike!</i>

1163
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:00,791
<i>Bowers.</i>

1164
01:47:01,291 --> 01:47:02,417
Mike. Fuck.

1165
01:47:04,002 --> 01:47:05,337
<i>- Mike!</i>
<i>- Where is he?</i>

1166
01:47:06,755 --> 01:47:07,839
<i>We're next.</i>

1167
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:09,633
<i>No, no, no!</i>

1168
01:47:09,841 --> 01:47:11,051
- Grab it!
- Get the rope! Get the rope!

1169
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:12,761
Oh, shit.

1170
01:47:14,262 --> 01:47:15,597
<i>- Mike!</i>
<i>- Mike!</i>

1171
01:47:16,515 --> 01:47:18,016
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

1172
01:47:19,643 --> 01:47:21,812
You didn't listen to what I told you,
did you?

1173
01:47:23,188 --> 01:47:25,816
You should've stayed out of Derry.

1174
01:47:26,024 --> 01:47:28,860
Your parents didn't
and look what happened to them.

1175
01:47:29,945 --> 01:47:32,531
I still get sad every time
I pass by that pile of ashes.

1176
01:47:32,989 --> 01:47:34,199
Sad,

1177
01:47:35,242 --> 01:47:36,660
that I couldn't have done it myself.

1178
01:47:37,536 --> 01:47:39,246
<i>Run, Mike!</i>

1179
01:47:45,669 --> 01:47:46,920
Mike!

1180
01:47:48,171 --> 01:47:49,256
Fuck down!

1181
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:54,302
I should get up there.

1182
01:47:54,678 --> 01:47:56,638
Are you insane? With what?

1183
01:48:25,167 --> 01:48:26,543
<i>Holy shit.</i>

1184
01:48:28,712 --> 01:48:30,422
- Oh, my--
- Mike!

1185
01:48:31,131 --> 01:48:32,465
I'm okay.

1186
01:48:32,883 --> 01:48:34,259
<i>I'm okay.</i>

1187
01:48:38,221 --> 01:48:39,389
Shoot!

1188
01:48:41,141 --> 01:48:42,517
<i>Stanley.</i>

1189
01:48:43,435 --> 01:48:44,769
<i>Beverly?</i>

1190
01:48:47,731 --> 01:48:49,191
<i>Is that you?</i>

1191
01:48:57,741 --> 01:48:58,783
Guys?

1192
01:49:02,412 --> 01:49:03,538
Guys?

1193
01:49:08,126 --> 01:49:09,961
- What?
- Guys, where's Stan?

1194
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:11,171
Stanley!

1195
01:49:11,379 --> 01:49:12,589
Stanley!

1196
01:49:12,756 --> 01:49:13,798
Stan!

1197
01:49:15,550 --> 01:49:17,010
Oh, shit. Greywater.

1198
01:49:20,013 --> 01:49:21,014
Stan?

1199
01:49:22,057 --> 01:49:23,099
Stan?

1200
01:49:24,351 --> 01:49:25,352
Stanley!

1201
01:49:50,293 --> 01:49:51,878
- Stan!
- Shit! Stan!

1202
01:49:52,963 --> 01:49:54,005
Stanley!

1203
01:49:54,798 --> 01:49:56,424
- We're coming, man!
- We're coming! Don't worry.

1204
01:49:59,761 --> 01:50:02,180
- Stan?
- Stanley! Stan!

1205
01:50:02,347 --> 01:50:03,348
His flashlight!

1206
01:50:07,227 --> 01:50:09,020
<i>What the fuck is that thing?</i>

1207
01:50:09,312 --> 01:50:10,313
Oh, shit.

1208
01:50:16,695 --> 01:50:17,696
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1209
01:50:25,245 --> 01:50:26,246
Oh, shit!

1210
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:28,081
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

1211
01:50:29,124 --> 01:50:30,166
Stanley!

1212
01:50:30,375 --> 01:50:32,168
- Stanley! Stan!
- Stanley!

1213
01:50:32,377 --> 01:50:35,463
No! No! No!

1214
01:50:35,630 --> 01:50:36,673
It's okay.

1215
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:39,759
You left me!
You took me into Neibolt!

1216
01:50:39,968 --> 01:50:41,011
You're not my friends!

1217
01:50:41,219 --> 01:50:43,054
You made me go into Neibolt!

1218
01:50:43,263 --> 01:50:44,264
<i>Stanley, I'm sorry.</i>

1219
01:50:44,431 --> 01:50:45,974
<i>You made me go into Neibolt!</i>

1220
01:50:48,018 --> 01:50:49,561
<i>This is your fault.</i>

1221
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,232
<i>We would never let anything happen
to you.</i>

1222
01:50:54,399 --> 01:50:55,483
<i>We're here for you.</i>

1223
01:50:55,692 --> 01:50:58,903
You know we wouldn't do that to you.
Come on.

1224
01:50:59,112 --> 01:51:01,197
Bill! Bill!

1225
01:51:02,157 --> 01:51:03,158
Bill!

1226
01:51:03,325 --> 01:51:04,576
<i>Bill!</i>

1227
01:51:36,608 --> 01:51:37,817
Beverly!

1228
01:52:04,386 --> 01:52:05,929
I'll come back for you, Bev.

1229
01:52:13,728 --> 01:52:14,896
Bill!

1230
01:52:17,982 --> 01:52:19,067
Bill!

1231
01:52:21,861 --> 01:52:22,987
Bill!

1232
01:52:23,446 --> 01:52:24,656
<i>Come on.</i>

1233
01:52:24,823 --> 01:52:26,199
Get out of there, dude.
That's greywater.

1234
01:52:26,408 --> 01:52:28,576
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God, my fucking flashlight?

1235
01:52:28,785 --> 01:52:30,412
Eddie!

1236
01:52:34,958 --> 01:52:37,168
Come on, let's get the fuck
out of here! Come on!

1237
01:52:54,727 --> 01:52:56,312
- Holy shit.
- Bev? Bev?

1238
01:52:57,272 --> 01:52:58,857
- Beverly?
- Holy shit.

1239
01:52:59,774 --> 01:53:00,775
Bev.

1240
01:53:06,865 --> 01:53:08,700
<i>How is she in the air?</i>

1241
01:53:10,743 --> 01:53:12,203
Guys.

1242
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:14,581
Are those...

1243
01:53:15,582 --> 01:53:16,875
<i>The missing kids.</i>

1244
01:53:17,876 --> 01:53:19,043
<i>Floating.</i>

1245
01:53:20,712 --> 01:53:22,547
- Just let me grab her.
- Shit.

1246
01:53:28,219 --> 01:53:29,471
<i>I'm slipping.</i>

1247
01:53:37,896 --> 01:53:38,897
Bev.

1248
01:53:40,231 --> 01:53:41,566
Beverly.

1249
01:53:41,733 --> 01:53:43,401
Why isn't she waking up?

1250
01:53:43,568 --> 01:53:45,320
What is wrong with her?

1251
01:53:45,570 --> 01:53:47,655
Beverly, please! Come on!

1252
01:54:00,919 --> 01:54:01,961
Wow.

1253
01:54:06,674 --> 01:54:07,842
<i>Bev?</i>

1254
01:54:12,430 --> 01:54:13,932
"January embers"

1255
01:54:14,432 --> 01:54:16,643
"My heart burns there too"

1256
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:20,605
Jesus, fuck.

1257
01:54:21,981 --> 01:54:23,483
Oh, God.

1258
01:54:32,659 --> 01:54:33,993
Where's Bill?

1259
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:39,874
<i>Georgie.</i>

1260
01:54:43,545 --> 01:54:44,879
What took you so long?

1261
01:54:49,175 --> 01:54:52,011
I was looking for you this whole time.

1262
01:54:53,638 --> 01:54:56,391
I couldn't find my way outta here.

1263
01:54:59,269 --> 01:55:01,729
He said I could have
my boat back, Billy.

1264
01:55:07,318 --> 01:55:08,611
Was she fast?

1265
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,698
I couldn't keep up with it.

1266
01:55:13,992 --> 01:55:15,159
"She," Georgie.

1267
01:55:18,162 --> 01:55:19,789
You call boats "she."

1268
01:55:22,542 --> 01:55:24,502
Take me home, Billy.

1269
01:55:31,801 --> 01:55:33,344
I wanna go home.

1270
01:55:37,098 --> 01:55:40,727
<i>I miss you.
I wanna be with Mom and Dad.</i>

1271
01:55:42,729 --> 01:55:46,190
I want more than anything
for you to be home.

1272
01:55:48,651 --> 01:55:51,529
With Mom and Dad.

1273
01:55:53,615 --> 01:55:56,034
I miss you so much.

1274
01:56:00,913 --> 01:56:02,582
I love you, Billy.

1275
01:56:04,292 --> 01:56:05,627
I love you, too.

1276
01:56:14,677 --> 01:56:16,137
But you're not Georgie.

1277
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:03,226
Kill It, Bill! Kill It!

1278
01:57:03,393 --> 01:57:04,435
<i>Shit.</i>

1279
01:57:04,602 --> 01:57:06,312
<i>Kill It, Bill!</i>

1280
01:57:07,188 --> 01:57:08,398
Kill It! Bill, Kill It!

1281
01:57:09,232 --> 01:57:10,316
<i>Kill It!</i>

1282
01:57:10,483 --> 01:57:11,484
- Kill It!
- Kill!

1283
01:57:11,651 --> 01:57:12,652
Kill It!

1284
01:57:13,194 --> 01:57:14,195
It's not loaded.

1285
01:57:14,362 --> 01:57:16,656
Do it now, Bill!
Kill It! Kill It!

1286
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:19,492
Hey! It's not loaded!

1287
01:57:22,578 --> 01:57:23,996
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

1288
01:57:24,706 --> 01:57:26,374
Oh, shit.

1289
01:57:33,923 --> 01:57:34,924
<i>Bill, watch out!</i>

1290
01:57:38,594 --> 01:57:39,595
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

1291
01:57:41,639 --> 01:57:42,640
<i>Beverly, no!</i>

1292
01:57:42,807 --> 01:57:43,891
<i>Mike!</i>

1293
01:57:49,272 --> 01:57:50,273
<i>Help him!</i>

1294
01:57:50,606 --> 01:57:52,150
Fuck!

1295
01:57:53,860 --> 01:57:54,902
Ben!

1296
01:57:59,574 --> 01:58:01,409
<i>Stanley!</i>

1297
01:58:08,082 --> 01:58:09,375
Bill!

1298
01:58:10,668 --> 01:58:11,669
<i>Bill!</i>

1299
01:58:12,336 --> 01:58:13,755
<i>No, don't.</i>

1300
01:58:14,505 --> 01:58:15,506
Let him go.

1301
01:58:15,715 --> 01:58:16,841
No.

1302
01:58:17,008 --> 01:58:18,885
I'll take him.

1303
01:58:19,093 --> 01:58:21,053
I'll take all of you.

1304
01:58:21,846 --> 01:58:26,058
<i>And I'll feast on your flesh
as I feed on your fear.</i>

1305
01:58:29,604 --> 01:58:31,189
Or,

1306
01:58:33,024 --> 01:58:35,193
you'll just leave us be.

1307
01:58:35,359 --> 01:58:38,446
I will take him, only him

1308
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:41,199
and then I will have my long rest

1309
01:58:41,407 --> 01:58:45,536
and you will all live to grow
and thrive

1310
01:58:45,745 --> 01:58:49,248
and lead happy lives

1311
01:58:49,957 --> 01:58:53,586
until old age takes you back
to the weeds.

1312
01:58:57,423 --> 01:58:58,633
Leave...

1313
01:59:00,927 --> 01:59:03,054
I'm the one who dragged you all into this.

1314
01:59:03,846 --> 01:59:05,932
I'm so sorry.

1315
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:07,141
<i>Sorry.</i>

1316
01:59:11,604 --> 01:59:13,731
Go!

1317
01:59:15,566 --> 01:59:16,943
Guys, we can't!

1318
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:20,571
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1319
01:59:23,157 --> 01:59:24,492
I told you, Bill.

1320
01:59:24,951 --> 01:59:26,244
<i>I fucking told you.</i>

1321
01:59:27,245 --> 01:59:29,247
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

1322
01:59:29,914 --> 01:59:31,249
It's your fault.

1323
01:59:33,751 --> 01:59:35,586
You punched me in the face.

1324
01:59:35,753 --> 01:59:37,296
You made me walk through shitty water.

1325
01:59:37,505 --> 01:59:38,965
You brought me to a fucking
crackhead house.

1326
01:59:40,591 --> 01:59:41,926
And now...

1327
01:59:45,638 --> 01:59:47,306
I'm gonna have to kill
this fucking clown.

1328
01:59:48,099 --> 01:59:49,767
Welcome to the Losers' Club, asshole!

1329
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:58,901
- Mike!
- Mike!

1330
02:00:04,740 --> 02:00:05,825
<i>Stan, watch out!</i>

1331
02:00:08,619 --> 02:00:09,662
Mike!

1332
02:00:19,171 --> 02:00:20,172
<i>Kill him!</i>

1333
02:00:48,659 --> 02:00:50,536
I'm gonna kill you!

1334
02:00:56,042 --> 02:00:58,878
<i>Hey, Bevvie.
Are you still my little--</i>

1335
02:01:08,512 --> 02:01:09,513
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

1336
02:01:29,408 --> 02:01:31,535
That's why you didn't kill Beverly.

1337
02:01:32,828 --> 02:01:36,040
'Cause she wasn't afraid.

1338
02:01:36,832 --> 02:01:38,501
<i>And we aren't either.</i>

1339
02:01:39,418 --> 02:01:40,753
<i>Not anymore.</i>

1340
02:01:43,214 --> 02:01:45,299
Now you're the one who's afraid.

1341
02:01:47,051 --> 02:01:48,552
Because you're gonna starve.

1342
02:01:55,685 --> 02:01:58,229
<i>"He thrusts
his fists against the posts</i>

1343
02:01:58,396 --> 02:02:01,899
<i>"and still insists he sees the ghosts</i>

1344
02:02:02,149 --> 02:02:05,152
<i>"He thrusts
his fists against the posts"</i>

1345
02:02:24,714 --> 02:02:25,756
Fear...

1346
02:02:37,727 --> 02:02:40,521
I know what I'm doing
for my summer experience essay.

1347
02:02:53,367 --> 02:02:55,411
Guys. Guys.

1348
02:02:56,954 --> 02:02:59,123
The kids are floating down.

1349
02:04:17,827 --> 02:04:20,287
I can only
remember parts,

1350
02:04:21,413 --> 02:04:23,124
I thought I was dead.

1351
02:04:24,542 --> 02:04:26,293
That's what it felt like.

1352
02:04:27,545 --> 02:04:30,714
I saw us, all of us together
back in the cistern,

1353
02:04:30,923 --> 02:04:32,800
but we were older,

1354
02:04:33,425 --> 02:04:35,511
like, our parents' ages.

1355
02:04:36,554 --> 02:04:39,890
What were we all doing there?

1356
02:04:40,432 --> 02:04:42,476
I just remember how we felt.

1357
02:04:44,145 --> 02:04:45,771
<i>How scared we were.</i>

1358
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:48,315
I don't think I can ever forget that.

1359
02:04:53,737 --> 02:04:54,738
Swear it.

1360
02:04:55,781 --> 02:04:57,074
Swear

1361
02:04:57,616 --> 02:04:59,618
if It isn't dead,

1362
02:05:00,286 --> 02:05:03,706
if It ever comes back,
we'll come back, too.

1363
02:06:28,582 --> 02:06:29,625
<i>I gotta go.</i>

1364
02:06:32,461 --> 02:06:33,462
I hate you.

1365
02:06:43,847 --> 02:06:45,599
I'll see you later.

1366
02:06:45,933 --> 02:06:46,934
<i>Bye, Stan.</i>

1367
02:06:52,564 --> 02:06:53,607
Bye, guys.

1368
02:06:53,816 --> 02:06:54,817
Bye, Mike.

1369
02:06:54,984 --> 02:06:55,985
See you later, losers.

1370
02:06:57,987 --> 02:06:58,988
See you around, Bill.

1371
02:06:59,154 --> 02:07:00,197
See you, Rich.

1372
02:07:00,364 --> 02:07:01,448
See you guys later.

1373
02:07:03,117 --> 02:07:04,618
Bye, Ben.

1374
02:07:09,206 --> 02:07:12,042
You all packed for Portland?

1375
02:07:13,043 --> 02:07:15,212
Yeah, pretty much.

1376
02:07:15,629 --> 02:07:16,880
I'm going tomorrow morning.

1377
02:07:17,047 --> 02:07:18,882
How long will you be gone?

1378
02:07:20,718 --> 02:07:24,722
My aunt, she says I can stay
for as long as I want, so...

1379
02:07:27,808 --> 02:07:29,226
Just so you know...

1380
02:07:31,353 --> 02:07:33,480
I never felt like a loser
when I was with all of you.

1381
02:07:43,907 --> 02:07:45,367
See you around.

1382
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:34,124
Bye.
