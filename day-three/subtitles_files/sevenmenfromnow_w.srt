1
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,398
Don't mean to be busting in on you...

2
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,378
but I couldn't help seeing your fire
from the ridge.

3
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,776
- What are you...
- You heard the gent.

4
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,812
He just stopped by
to get in out of the rain.

5
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,981
- Ain't that right?
- That's right.

6
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,514
Come on in.

7
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,826
Thanks.

8
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,665
I'd be obliged for a cup of that coffee.

9
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,228
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

10
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,946
It's a mighty wet night
for a man to be out.

11
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:38,985
Sure is.

12
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,157
You must have rode a long way.

13
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:46,860
I walked.

14
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,288
Ain't you got no horse?

15
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,492
Did have.

16
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,936
Chiricahua jumped me.
About 10 miles back.

17
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,498
- They stole him?
- They ate him.

18
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,917
Don't I know you
from somewhere, mister?

19
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,251
Ever been in Silver Springs?

20
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,953
Can't say as I have.

21
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,299
I come from there.

22
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,536
I hear there was a killing in Silver.

23
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,237
Yeah, I heard.

24
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,236
The rain's slacking off, Clint.
We better get moving before...

25
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,712
What's your hurry?

26
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,680
No close town around.

27
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,829
That killing...

28
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,302
they ever catch up to
them fellows that done it?

29
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,301
Two of them.

30
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,370
Giddap.

31
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,538
Here.

32
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,787
- Good morning.
- Yes, isn't it?

33
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,587
- Looks like you could use a little help.
- A lot of help, mister.

34
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,753
These poor animals are about worn out.
Not to mention us.

35
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:13,560
Oh, the name's Greer, John Greer.
And this is Annie, my wife.

36
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,037
Ma'am.

37
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:27,005
- Well, think we can get it out, Mister...
- Stride, Ben Stride.

38
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,339
Sun's going to dry this mud before long.

39
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,644
And, is that good?

40
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:34,081
- Like as not, it'll hard up like a rock.
- I see.

41
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,757
Look, Mr. Stride,
all I own is in this wagon.

42
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:42,159
I can't say that I'd like to make
this mudhole my home.

43
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:46,221
I sure would appreciate it if you'd get
up there and make these horses pull.

44
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,826
Get up there yourself.

45
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,030
Anytime you're ready, Mr. Greer.

46
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:33,338
Giddap! Giddap, there!

47
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,808
Giddap, there. Come on, giddap!

48
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,888
Giddap! Giddap, there!

49
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,274
Well, I'd say that's the way
to get a wagon out of the mud.

50
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:12,013
I'd get to water as soon as I could
and wash your animals down...

51
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,677
before that mud cakes on them.

52
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,482
I'll do that, Mr. Stride.

53
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,487
I can't thank you enough.
Can we, Annie?

54
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,359
Glad to be of help.

55
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:22,896
Good day.

56
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,925
Oh, Mr. Stride?

57
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,837
I don't know exactly
how to say this, but...

58
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:35,403
well, if there's another mudhole
in Arizona, we'll get stuck in it, and...

59
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,736
Well, I'd feel a whole lot better
if you'd ride along with us.

60
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,511
I'm headed south.

61
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,673
Well, so are we.
Looks like we got company, Annie.

62
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,728
- Mr. Stride.
- Ma'am.

63
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,340
I want you to know
how much we appreciate this...

64
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,240
- your riding with us.
- Glad to be of help, if I can.

65
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,835
Oh, you can!

66
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,073
That isn't the first trouble we've had.

67
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,980
We've had broken wheels,
broken spokes, broken hubs, and...

68
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:55,612
Goodness knows what would have
happened if you hadn't come along.

69
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,790
We're from the East, you know.

70
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,795
I figured you were.

71
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:12,000
I just wanted to let you know
how much we appreciate this...

72
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,567
your riding along with us.

73
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,621
Well, as I was saying...

74
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:37,254
I'll never forget the look in Annie's eyes
when I told her what I wanted to do.

75
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,389
I guess she thought I was crazy.

76
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:43,128
"You can't talk your way from
Kansas City to California," she said.

77
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,767
And the most outdoors I've ever seen
was our own backyard.

78
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,042
She didn't try to stop me. Nope.
Not Annie.

79
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:56,109
It sure is wild country.
Well, I like wild things.

80
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:59,684
I guess that's why I've never been
able to settle down to one job.

81
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:02,152
It'll be different this time, though...

82
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,654
if we ever make it.

83
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,849
I never knew any place could be so far.

84
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,224
Yeah, they say there's no end to what
a good salesman can make out there.

85
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,956
What with the shipping trade and all.

86
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,965
Did you ever hear that, Mr. Stride?

87
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,405
Yes. Yes, I have.

88
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,377
Better wash his withers down again.

89
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,107
- They go raw easy with mud on them.
- You're the boss.

90
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:34,449
Of course, Annie was right about
my not being able to talk my way...

91
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,521
across the country.

92
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,749
Our money ran dry two weeks ago.

93
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,217
I've had to take odd jobs
along the way to stake us.

94
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,422
But we'll make it.
California, that's where we're going.

95
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,092
Figure you'll get there heading south?

96
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,896
I plan to swing west
to get at Flora Vista.

97
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,870
That way I can follow
the Sonora borderline all the way in.

98
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,807
At least, that's what a fellow told me
back in Silver Springs.

99
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,512
There. That clean enough, Mr. Stride?

100
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,682
Mr. Stride, that clean enough?

101
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,856
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's fine.
- Good.

102
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,893
Come on, boy.

103
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,065
Annie. Better hurry up.
Time we were moving.

104
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,004
Come on, boy.

105
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,924
I think we can make it here.

106
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,321
They're headed for Flora Vista, all right.

107
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,112
- Got a gun, Greer?
- Yes.

108
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,220
Get it.

109
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,449
- Afternoon, gentlemen. Ma'am.
- Afternoon.

110
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:57,084
I'm Lt. Collins
of the Second Squadron of the Fifth.

111
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,748
What can we do for you, Lieutenant?

112
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,348
- That depends.
- On what?

113
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,223
We've been dispatched
from Fort Crittenden...

114
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,694
to make a wide sweep south...

115
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:07,164
in an attempt to contact any and all
Chiricahua in the area.

116
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,565
Reports indicate they may be
massing along the border.

117
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,867
Can't be more than 50 of them left
in the whole territory.

118
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,432
According to our scouts,
there's well over 100.

119
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,807
That including the squaws, Lieutenant?

120
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,406
I take it you don't think
the Indians are dangerous.

121
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,505
They're worse than that. They're hungry.

122
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,641
Nothing as deadly as
a half-starved Chiricahua.

123
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,219
Well, then, we agree.

124
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,288
Do we?

125
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,019
We're heading
for Flora Vista, Lieutenant.

126
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,184
Do you think we can make it
without running into trouble?

127
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,693
Well, that, I can't say.

128
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,457
However, I strongly recommend
that you swing this wagon around...

129
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,430
and head on back the way you came.

130
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,969
Unfortunately, the military has
no jurisdiction over civilians.

131
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,435
But if you have any regard
for the safety of the lady...

132
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,030
I'd think twice
before continuing on south.

133
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:51,935
Good day, ma'am, sir.

134
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,804
Forward, ho.

135
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,455
Seems like it gets harder and harder
to get to California.

136
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,792
Seems that way.

137
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,761
You're going on south,
aren't you, Mr. Stride?

138
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,135
Far as I can.

139
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,037
Well, why can't we stick together?

140
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,110
- I realize there's a risk involved, but...
- Look, Mr. Greer.

141
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,576
You can swing west here
as well as at the border.

142
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,544
A day will put you on the side
of the Gila River.

143
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,845
All you have to do then is keep it
to your right and follow it on in.

144
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:35,045
Shouldn't ought to take you more than
four days out of your way.

145
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,689
I've been obliged to know you.

146
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,625
Stride...

147
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,563
I'm not going to head west
and I'm not turning back.

148
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,031
It's your wagon.

149
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,076
Come on, boy. Can't let them go alone.

150
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:08,854
Let's go.

151
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,250
Kind of a lonesome spot for a ranch,
isn't it, Mr. Stride?

152
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,557
It's a relay station for the Overland Line.

153
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,632
- No use sitting here, let's get...
- Hold it!

154
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,293
Let the team stand. I'll go have a look.

155
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,028
Old-timer?

156
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:45,344
Me?

157
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,713
Guess it's gotta be, don't it.
Nobody else here.

158
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,447
- Where are they?
- It's hard to say.

159
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,222
Headed up towards the north, maybe.

160
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,018
Then again,
they might even have turned west.

161
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,691
But, like I say...

162
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,426
it's hard to say.

163
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,423
- What run them off?
- Chiricahua.

164
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,231
Soldier boys come riding through
three days ago.

165
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,929
Claimed the Injuns was fixin'
to kick up their heels.

166
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:15,201
Then we seen war fire
in them hills to the south.

167
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:19,200
So they all just up and took off
like a scalded dog.

168
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,712
Guess they figured jobs
is easier to come by than hair.

169
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,078
I'm the only one stayed behind.

170
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,051
Injuns don't bother with me.

171
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,652
I ain't worth too awful much.

172
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,455
You say they pulled out
about three days ago?

173
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:39,258
Yeah. Bartender, he left, too.

174
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,993
Well, I'll be seeing you.
We gotta be moving.

175
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,265
You ought to do the same, mister.

176
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,498
Unless you hanker for a haircut
from a Chiricahua barber.

177
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,105
Come on, Claire.

178
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,144
Well, <i>adiós.</i>

179
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,311
That's Spanish.

180
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,489
Hello, Stride.

181
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,726
I've been looking to find you, Masters.

182
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,025
I figured you would be.

183
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,999
Soon as I heard what happened
in Silver, I figured you would.

184
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:17,694
- Ain't that right, Clete?
- Yep.

185
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,396
I half thought
you might know something...

186
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,496
about what happened in Silver.

187
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,175
Maybe.

188
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,004
If you're thinking I roll with them gents,
you dead wrong.

189
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:30,014
I helped bury a few men in my time
but I ain't never sunk that low.

190
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:31,674
I hope not, Masters.

191
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:34,946
- I'd hate to have to kill you.
- I'd hate to have you try.

192
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,592
- Everything all right, Mr. Stride?
- We'll be staying here for the night.

193
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,297
I'll see to watering the stock
and bedding them down.

194
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:56,273
Get your possibles and move inside.
A hot meal will do us all good.

195
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:59,539
- Can I give you a hand?
- Just do like I tell you.

196
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,092
I wonder what's the matter with him.

197
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,758
Sheriff's got things on his mind.

198
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,632
- Ain't that right, Clete?
- Yep.

199
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:26,872
Ma'am.

200
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:43,756
Sheriff.

201
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,808
I'll tell you, this has got to be cooking.

202
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,369
Real cooking.

203
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:11,877
Ain't that right, Clete?

204
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,184
I said, "Ain't that right?"

205
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,184
Yeah, sure. That's right.

206
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:22,453
Have to excuse Clete, here, ma'am.
He's kind of short on manners.

207
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,525
- More coffee?
- Well, yes, ma'am.

208
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,624
Don't mind if I do. Don't mind at all.

209
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,537
More coffee, John?

210
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:36,542
John?

211
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,135
More coffee?

212
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,009
No, thanks, Annie.

213
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,711
You say you're from Silver Springs,
Mr. Masters.

214
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,919
- Mostly.
- He was born there.

215
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,418
- Who said?
- You said!

216
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:55,717
I was young when I come there, Clete,
but I wasn't born there.

217
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:02,667
My folks had me in a shack up
in Lerno, ma'am.

218
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:05,731
They moved to Silver
the summer I was first able to walk.

219
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:09,296
And Mr. Stride, is he from Silver, too?

220
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:10,841
The sheriff, ma'am?

221
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,906
Yes, ma'am.
He was the law there for 12 years.

222
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,574
Was?

223
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:19,273
Yeah, they held an election
back last fall. Sheriff, he run...

224
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,547
but he wasn't much at kissing babies.

225
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,554
When they come to counting up...

226
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:27,388
he didn't have nothing but a spot on
his shirt where the badge used to hang.

227
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,184
Of course,
that won't make no never mind...

228
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,626
when he catches up
to them that done it.

229
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,661
The killing back in Silver.

230
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,736
- Didn't he tell you?
- No.

231
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,405
I reckon he wouldn't, at that.

232
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:44,307
You say there was a killing,
Mr. Masters?

233
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,338
Silver express office was held up.

234
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:49,771
Fargo box was stole. Lot of shooting.

235
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,884
Somebody was bound to get hurt.

236
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:52,111
Somebody was bound to get hurt.

237
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,985
Just too bad it had to be her.

238
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,055
Her?

239
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,959
Yeah, they killed her. The Sheriff's wife.

240
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,575
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

241
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,450
Is that a coyote?

242
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:29,886
I hope so.

243
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,652
Mr. Masters told us about...

244
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,327
Well, he told us about your wife.

245
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,426
Would you like to talk about her?

246
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:43,593
I know it's none of my business...

247
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,466
but it might make it easier.

248
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:49,741
You're right, Mrs. Greer.
It's none of your business...

249
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,605
and it won't make it any easier.

250
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,407
Good night.

251
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,381
Mrs. Greer?

252
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:03,249
There's one thing Masters in there
didn't tell you.

253
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:09,861
The reason my wife is dead.

254
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,426
Six months ago...

255
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,658
I lost my job
as the Sheriff of Silver Springs.

256
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:19,471
Three of those months,
I tried to get work.

257
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:23,338
Work that was fitting an ex-sheriff,
but I didn't find any.

258
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:26,872
The town allowed as
I could be the Deputy...

259
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:31,410
but my pride wouldn't let me,
so my wife had to take a job.

260
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:35,218
A clerk, checking freight for Fargo.

261
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:40,356
She was working at that job
the night she was killed.

262
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,592
Good night, Mrs. Greer.

263
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:06,181
Mighty fancy lady, that Mrs. Greer.

264
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,647
Think they'd get tired of crawling
around out there playing coyote.

265
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:17,422
Sheriff...

266
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:21,423
folks back in Silver said
you high-ended it out of town...

267
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,230
without knowing how much
them gents rode off with.

268
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,696
$20,000 in gold.

269
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,035
Fargo box near full of the stuff.

270
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:36,079
Of course, I know that ain't the reason
you're riding them down, but...

271
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,308
Well, that's sort of
why I'm gonna tag along with you.

272
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:47,189
You see, me and Clete figure that
when they left Silver they scattered.

273
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:48,453
Seven of them.

274
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,363
Two fresh-dug holes
where your tracks begin.

275
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,858
That leaves five still alive.

276
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,904
And one of them's got that strongbox.

277
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:01,573
So?

278
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,375
So.

279
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:06,503
If they're headed for Flora Vista...

280
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,875
That means they're fixing
to trade the gold across the border...

281
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,141
and ride away rich.

282
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:11,744
That is...

283
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,978
unless, of course, you catch up to them.

284
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,348
And if I do?

285
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:19,748
Then, all that stands
between me and $20,000...

286
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,020
is you.

287
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:23,390
Good night, Sheriff.

288
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:24,656
Masters.

289
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:25,964
Yeah?

290
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:29,129
You know who they are, don't you?

291
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:30,861
Maybe.

292
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,504
One thing for sure, though.

293
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:34,937
They know you.

294
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:37,932
You see, that's the trouble
with being a sheriff.

295
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:40,841
The only time you get to know a man
by his face...

296
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,914
is when you shut a cell door on it...

297
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,110
like you did mine.

298
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,732
- More coffee?
- No, thanks, Mrs. Greer.

299
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,475
- More coffee, John?
- No, thanks, Annie.

300
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:32,189
Hold it!

301
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,296
That was using your head, Stride.

302
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,628
I think we could have
handled them, though.

303
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,571
I was just going for my rifle.
I was scared.

304
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,868
We all were scared.

305
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,312
We better get moving. That horse
isn't going to hold them off long.

306
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:03,980
- It just don't seem right to me.
- What don't?

307
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:07,449
Why a full woman like that
would settle for half a man.

308
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:09,384
Why don't you ask her why?

309
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,048
Maybe I will, Clete. Maybe I will.

310
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,153
You stay with the wagon, Clete.

311
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:17,582
I'll get your horse.

312
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,648
He was fixing to cut you down.

313
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,884
You know him?

314
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:51,819
- No.
- He sure knew you...

315
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,020
Sheriff.

316
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:10,533
Mrs. Greer...

317
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:12,701
I suppose she want to read
over this gent.

318
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,712
All she said was to see
he's covered in a proper grave.

319
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,338
It's a waste of time, anyhow.

320
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,314
If a man ain't ready
when he gets this far...

321
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:22,546
a couple of holies said over his grave
ain't gonna help him none.

322
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,781
Anyhow, he ain't dug too deep.

323
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,581
- Clete.
- Yep?

324
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:29,660
- How old do you figure she is?
- Who?

325
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,160
Annie Greer.

326
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:33,562
Now, how would I know?

327
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,496
Twenty-five, twenty-six, would you say?

328
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,899
Want me to bury your boots, too?

329
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,939
She's a real looker, ain't she?

330
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,564
She ain't ugly.

331
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:46,701
A man could grow mighty fond
of a woman like that.

332
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,147
Looks like one already has.

333
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:52,684
Now, what would ever make you say
a thing like that, Clete?

334
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,668
That should be enough.

335
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,506
- Here, let me do this.
- Thank you.

336
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,201
Most men object
to doing a woman's work.

337
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,871
I hardly blame them, though.

338
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:58,779
They're right about our work
never being done.

339
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:05,014
Sure don't look like a man
with killing on his mind.

340
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:07,492
Say, you're quite a hand at this.

341
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:10,426
A woman would be fortunate
to have you around.

342
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,988
Would she, ma'am?

343
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,966
You shouldn't blame yourself
for what happened.

344
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:26,467
A man ought to be able
to take care of his woman.

345
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,068
Like my man?

346
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:31,739
Do you think I love him any less
because of the way he is?

347
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:33,782
Yes, ma'am.

348
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,554
You're making a big mistake,
Mrs. Greer.

349
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:40,318
Them clothes of yours.
They'll never dry.

350
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,892
Storm's coming.

351
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:31,300
Hey, wake up.

352
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,504
Come on, take over.
I'm gonna go get me a cup of coffee.

353
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:46,122
Well, right cozy in here, ain't it?

354
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:48,021
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

355
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,354
Coffee?

356
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,018
Don't mind if I do.

357
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:53,063
I'm afraid it's not as hot as it could be.

358
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:54,860
Just so as it's black.

359
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:00,895
- Storm seems to be letting up some.
- Yes, ma'am.

360
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:04,100
Stars'll be showing,
time it's your turn to take the guard.

361
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:07,203
Mr. Masters,
you know this part of the country.

362
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:08,574
Every rock.

363
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,205
Well, how far would you say we are
from Flora Vista?

364
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:12,840
With an early start come morning...

365
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,317
you should be able to noon there
with near no trouble at all.

366
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:17,450
Thank you.

367
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,819
Sure is good coffee, ma'am.

368
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,097
Mr. Greer...

369
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,430
how come you ever to
marry such a handsome woman?

370
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,432
Well, I...

371
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,733
We fell in love, Mr. Masters.

372
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:36,933
Love?

373
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,035
That's a mighty fancy word.

374
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:45,174
That's the trouble with the likes
of you and me, Sheriff.

375
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:48,810
We never take time out
for the fancy things in life.

376
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:54,258
We leave that to the fellows
that run sort of gentle, soft.

377
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:02,498
More coffee?

378
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:09,435
Been that way ever since ever, I guess.

379
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:14,209
Of course, that ain't saying that women
don't warm up to the likes of us.

380
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:15,711
Why, no, sir.

381
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:20,516
Why, I knew me a little old gal one time,
looked a whole lot like you, Mrs. Greer.

382
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,353
She'd been married
maybe five, six years.

383
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,920
Husband, he kind of short on spine.

384
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:29,292
And one day, along come this big,
good-looking gent...

385
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,487
started warming up to her.

386
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:35,128
First thing you know, why,
this little old gal, she just up and...

387
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,292
Drink your coffee, Masters.

388
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:47,003
Ain't you interested
in what she up and did, Sheriff?

389
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,576
You...

390
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:55,345
you say she looked like me?

391
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:58,379
Not near as pretty, ma'am.

392
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:02,319
Her eyes, they didn't show
a deep blue like yours.

393
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:06,387
Can't recollect her hair too well...

394
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:10,059
but couldn't have been near as soft
or as black as yours.

395
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,299
And the way she walked...

396
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:14,796
nothing like you.

397
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:19,469
You move like you're all over alive.

398
00:41:21,213 --> 00:41:23,909
And you say words quiet, soft.

399
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:30,014
Kind of making a man wish that
you was talking to him and nobody else.

400
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:39,761
Yeah, she looked a lot like you, ma'am.
But not near as pretty.

401
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,901
Well, I guess it's about time
we were turning in.

402
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,703
Well, don't you want to hear
the rest of the story, Mr. Greer?

403
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,472
You might could
learn something from it.

404
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,775
I don't understand.

405
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,446
Don't you?

406
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,910
He said he didn't.

407
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:07,087
You know what, Sheriff?
I just happened to think of something.

408
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:08,625
Danged if you don't remind me...

409
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,786
of that big, good-looking gent
I was talking about.

410
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,623
You know, the one that run off
with the other fellow's woman?

411
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:20,401
Seems that ain't nobody don't remind
you of somebody tonight, Masters.

412
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:24,542
Seems that way, don't it?

413
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:34,317
Sure you don't wanna hear
the rest of the story?

414
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,195
Suit yourself.

415
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,895
Much obliged for the coffee, ma'am.
Good night.

416
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,563
Good night, Sheriff.

417
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:07,111
Masters.

418
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,351
- Yeah?
- Leave him alone.

419
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:16,256
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Just do as I tell you.

420
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:18,329
Maybe you better
mind your own business.

421
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,763
Unless, of course,
Mrs. Greer in there is your business.

422
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:23,561
Good night, Sheriff.

423
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:26,497
I said, good night.

424
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:54,624
Get up.

425
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:03,033
It might be better all around
if you'd move along, Masters.

426
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:06,700
Maybe you're right.

427
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,044
Let's saddle up, Clete.

428
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,276
Here...

429
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:15,749
you'll be needing that.

430
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:25,790
Come on down.
I'll relieve you at midnight.

431
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:19,915
Mr. Stride?

432
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:32,828
Yes, ma'am?

433
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,730
Those...

434
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:39,327
Those men you're after...

435
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:42,565
they'll be waiting for you
in Flora Vista, won't they?

436
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,865
That depends.

437
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:49,806
Please, be careful.

438
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:53,116
Yes, ma'am. I plan to.

439
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,459
Good night.

440
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,463
Good night, Mrs. Greer.

441
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:21,401
Pour us a drink, Clete.

442
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,374
Where is everybody?

443
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,284
Hello, Masters.

444
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,750
Why, hello, Bodeen.

445
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:14,319
I kind of figured I'd find you around here.

446
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:17,326
Clete, this is Payte Bodeen
from Silver Springs.

447
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:19,188
Clete.

448
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,836
You're kind of a long way from home,
ain't you?

449
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:29,463
No more than you.

450
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:33,744
I can go back.

451
00:48:40,852 --> 00:48:42,114
Ladies.

452
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,882
This here is going to be
a private conversation, Nelly.

453
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:46,616
Well, sure, Payte. Sure.

454
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:49,585
You boys join me in a drink?

455
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:51,853
That's what we've come for.

456
00:48:58,236 --> 00:48:59,396
Cheers.

457
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:06,567
Strange, ain't it?

458
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:08,578
Running onto each other like this.

459
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,375
- Is it?
- Yeah.

460
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:15,517
Man don't ride south in this country
unless he got a reason.

461
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:25,553
- You got a reason, Masters?
- What do you think?

462
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:34,561
I hear they had themselves a holdup
back in Silver.

463
00:49:34,906 --> 00:49:36,635
Yeah, we heard that.

464
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:43,809
It'll go hard with them that done it,
if they catch up to them.

465
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:47,174
Yeah, it sure will.

466
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:48,252
Payte!

467
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,253
Howdy, Payte.

468
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:55,483
Everything all right?

469
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:57,527
Everything's just fine.

470
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:00,222
- Have a drink.
- Can use it.

471
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,731
Been running from Chiricahua
for two days.

472
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,699
Lucky to be here at all.

473
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:21,043
You boys waiting for somebody?

474
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,676
They ain't coming.

475
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:28,717
Ground's gonna be full of men,
time Stride gets through.

476
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:30,421
Stride?

477
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,557
Since when's he toting a badge again?

478
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:36,758
He ain't. Oh, didn't you know?
It was his wife they killed...

479
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:39,302
in that express office back in Silver.

480
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,399
Much obliged for the drink.
Come on, Clete.

481
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:49,003
- Masters.
- Yeah?

482
00:50:50,982 --> 00:50:53,678
Stride turned a key on you once,
didn't he?

483
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,310
Twice.

484
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:58,585
Man put me in jail...

485
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:04,025
I'd get even with him, if I could.

486
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:05,923
I don't follow you.

487
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:11,790
Them holdup fellows.
They got off with $20,000 in gold.

488
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:14,331
I heard.

489
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,138
So, it figures...

490
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:20,776
if they knew where to find the gent that
was after them, before he found them...

491
00:51:21,345 --> 00:51:24,246
they'd stand a whole lot better chance
of getting to spend it.

492
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:26,583
If I was them...

493
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:30,650
I'd be willing to offer a fair amount
for information like that.

494
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:35,222
When would a man get
this fair amount...

495
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,123
supposing of course,
that you were them?

496
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:46,432
When the wagon gets here
with the gold.

497
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:47,663
Wagon?

498
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:51,570
Fellow's bringing it in from Silver for us.

499
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:53,143
Name's Greer.

500
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:57,175
John Greer.

501
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:14,155
- Well, Mr. Stride, good luck.
- Same to you.

502
00:52:14,265 --> 00:52:16,733
And, thanks. Thanks a lot.

503
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:27,538
Mr. Stride?

504
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,117
I didn't want you to leave
without your clean shirt.

505
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:43,117
- I washed it for you.
- Thank you.

506
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:48,429
- Will we be seeing you in Flora Vista?
- I'll be there.

507
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:52,565
- I wish you'd let us go in with you.
- You know I can't do that.

508
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:59,666
- They'll kill you, won't they?
- They'll try.

509
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:02,177
- Then why...
- Look, Mrs. Greer...

510
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:06,342
I'm obliged for your concern.

511
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:14,087
You must have loved her very much.

512
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:19,222
- She was a good woman.
- Yes, she'd have to be.

513
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:01,739
Look.

514
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:05,241
It's Stride's horse.

515
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:36,931
Annie!

516
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:00,158
How is he?

517
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,994
I don't know how he is.
He is still unconscious.

518
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,464
- Anything I can do?
- No.

519
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:07,296
Annie...

520
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:09,065
we ought to
take him on into Flora Vista.

521
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:11,539
- There's bound to be a doctor there...
- We can't do that, John.

522
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:14,440
- But he's liable to die.
- Well, don't you think I know that?

523
01:00:14,545 --> 01:00:17,139
Annie, we're taking him on in.

524
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:20,313
You listen to me, John Greer.

525
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:22,908
If it wasn't for Stride,
we'd still be hub-high in mud...

526
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,681
twenty miles out of Silver.

527
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,221
He had reason to leave us,
good reason...

528
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:27,915
but he didn't,
because he knew we needed him.

529
01:00:28,025 --> 01:00:30,050
- But, Annie, you've got to...
- Those men in Flora Vista...

530
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,219
are waiting for him.
Waiting to shoot him down.

531
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:35,430
You take Stride's horse in
and bring a doctor back.

532
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:38,199
Annie.

533
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:41,268
Annie, I can't do that.

534
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:44,640
I've got to take the wagon in when I go.
It's something I have to do.

535
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:46,300
I just have to.

536
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:50,175
When we came through Silver,
remember I told you I got a job?

537
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,804
Well, I did, only...

538
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:53,746
Well, it wasn't a real job.

539
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:56,809
I guess I knew it was wrong
all along, but...

540
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,013
Well, you know we needed the money.

541
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:02,486
They said I was to ask no questions,
just do as they told me.

542
01:01:02,593 --> 01:01:05,460
I swear, I didn't know
it was going to turn out like this.

543
01:01:05,562 --> 01:01:07,621
John, what are you trying to say?

544
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,767
Annie, come here.

545
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:35,553
This is what I'm trying to say.

546
01:01:35,659 --> 01:01:38,423
$500 they said they'd give me.
All I had to do was haul it.

547
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:41,726
I picked it up in the tool shed
behind the express office.

548
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,355
- No...
- They're waiting for me now...

549
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:45,958
in the saloon in Flora Vista.
I'm due there today.

550
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,799
That's why I couldn't turn back.

551
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:51,341
- And I can't take Stride's horse in.
- Throw it down, Mr. Greer.

552
01:01:56,914 --> 01:01:59,348
If I go in without this, they'll kill me.

553
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:01,245
Throw it down.

554
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,793
Mrs. Greer, get up in the seat.

555
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:21,737
Just south of that canyon wall...

556
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:25,104
the trail swings west.
Stay on it, you'll get to California.

557
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:27,707
What about you?

558
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:30,710
It's the gold they're after.
If you don't show up...

559
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:32,577
they'll be along to get me.

560
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:35,048
But you can't do this.

561
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:36,676
Only thing I can do.

562
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:39,278
I've thought about it,
it's the only chance I've got...

563
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:41,220
them coming to me.

564
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:43,786
Those men, Stride...

565
01:02:45,162 --> 01:02:46,789
I didn't know what they'd done.

566
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:48,626
You have to believe that.

567
01:02:48,866 --> 01:02:51,699
If I thought it any different,
I'd have killed you.

568
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,265
Now, get her out of here.

569
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,509
Stride.

570
01:03:57,534 --> 01:04:00,765
Annie, there's bound to be
a sheriff in Flora Vista.

571
01:04:01,104 --> 01:04:03,004
We can't leave him back there.

572
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,684
They should've been back by now,
Payte.

573
01:04:24,795 --> 01:04:26,626
- Maybe we'd better...
- Shut up.

574
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:29,296
Been me,
I'd never send just two men out.

575
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,566
Man like Stride's awful tough to kill.

576
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:35,195
You talk a lot, Masters.

577
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,636
Couldn't be I touched you
where it hurt, could it, Payte?

578
01:04:39,743 --> 01:04:42,211
Sometimes he gets awful touchy.

579
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:45,338
Say out in words
what you're thinking, Masters.

580
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:47,911
Payte?

581
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:51,845
You wanna know what I'm thinking?

582
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,761
I think you sent them boys
out on purpose not to come back.

583
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:03,458
You think I'd do a thing like that?

584
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:06,200
I know you would.

585
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:14,400
Then it figures I'd do the same to you...

586
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:17,142
if I get the chance.

587
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:26,649
You got it.

588
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:39,030
Wagon's coming!

589
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:14,165
Hello, Greer!

590
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:21,069
We were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

591
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:29,209
Why don't you pull around back here?
We'll help you unload.

592
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:31,648
There's nothing to unload.

593
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:38,689
- Where is it?
- Stride's got it.

594
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:46,393
He says if you want it,
you'll have to come and get it.

595
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:47,864
You know where he is?

596
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:50,337
About a half-hour north
in a deep canyon.

597
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:53,340
He's sitting there, waiting.

598
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:56,503
I know the place, Payte.

599
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:11,588
- You wait here, Annie.
- John.

600
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:42,491
I suppose you'll figure as
I owe you something, Greer.

601
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:45,561
No. But there's something I owe Stride.

602
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,268
Get out of my way, Bodeen.

603
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:56,431
Go around.

604
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:34,573
I was wrong, Clete.
He wasn't half a man.

605
01:08:40,951 --> 01:08:42,145
Come on.

606
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,366
There it is.

607
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:16,051
Stride!

608
01:09:19,556 --> 01:09:22,286
This here is Payte Bodeen!

609
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:29,490
We come to get the box!

610
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:34,936
- Well, let's go get...
- Hold it.

611
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:38,538
- Think you can get a rope over it?
- You know I can.

612
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:42,474
I'll circle around.
We'll come at it from both sides.

613
01:13:29,305 --> 01:13:30,397
Hold it!

614
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:54,861
- What happened up there?
- Payte Bodeen...

615
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:56,990
I killed him.

616
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,933
- Why?
- Why not?

617
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:05,474
- Clete?
- Dead.

618
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:10,441
Sure is a shame, me and you
having to face it out this way.

619
01:14:12,382 --> 01:14:14,350
You could have stayed behind a rock.

620
01:14:15,852 --> 01:14:17,877
I never could enjoy
spending this $20,000...

621
01:14:17,987 --> 01:14:20,080
I'd done you that way, Sheriff.

622
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:27,059
I don't suppose
there's any way of getting at this box...

623
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:28,858
aside from going over you.

624
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:35,798
I didn't figure there was.

625
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,073
I sure would hate to have to do this...

626
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:42,007
what with Annie Greer
being how she is.

627
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:44,871
How is she?

628
01:14:46,883 --> 01:14:47,872
A widow.

629
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:53,155
Her husband,
he talked himself to death...

630
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:55,816
in front of the Sheriff's office
in Flora Vista.

631
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:57,819
A man can do that.

632
01:15:00,697 --> 01:15:01,823
Yeah.

633
01:15:06,402 --> 01:15:08,495
Anytime you're ready, Sheriff.

634
01:16:38,328 --> 01:16:40,762
I think you've made a wise decision,
Mrs. Greer.

635
01:16:40,863 --> 01:16:43,627
I understand California
is a mighty pretty place.

636
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,300
And you?

637
01:16:46,603 --> 01:16:49,128
I'll be taking that job as deputy in Silver.

638
01:16:50,006 --> 01:16:53,442
If there ever comes then,
when you're anywhere near...

639
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,940
I'll allow as I'll be there.

640
01:16:58,047 --> 01:16:59,480
I'll remember that.

641
01:17:02,085 --> 01:17:05,521
- Goodbye, Mrs. Greer.
- Goodbye.

642
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:26,475
- Driver.
- Ma'am?

643
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:30,468
- Take my baggage off the coach.
- Ain't you going with us?

644
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:33,706
Not for a while, anyway.
