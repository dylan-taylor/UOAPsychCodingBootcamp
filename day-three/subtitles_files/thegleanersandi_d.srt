1
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:51,794
THE GLEANERS AND I

2
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:56,590
G as in gleaning -

3
00:00:57,163 --> 00:01:00,010
To glean is to gather
after the harvest.

4
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:04,014
A gleaner is one who gleans.

5
00:01:05,202 --> 00:01:07,454
In times past only women gleaned.

6
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:11,239
Millet's Glaneuses
were in all dictionaries.

7
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:16,494
The original painting
is at the Orsay.

8
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:38,598
Gleaning, that's the old way.

9
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:43,217
My mother'd say, '' Pick everything up
so nothing gets wasted''.

10
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:47,701
But sadly we no longer do

11
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:50,912
because machines
are so efficient nowadays.

12
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:54,186
But before, I used to glean

13
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:56,428
together with my neighbors,

14
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:59,431
for wheat, and rice too.

15
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,779
I would put my big apron on

16
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:09,690
and we'd go gleaning ears of wheat,

17
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:11,849
lovely ears we would find.

18
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:19,710
A whole day in the sun,
with gnats and mosquitoes biting,

19
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:21,347
it wasn't too nice,

20
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:23,182
but we liked it.

21
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:28,896
Evenings, we were exhausted. Once
home with our bags and our aprons

22
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:35,016
we'd have a good time laughing
and drinking coffee together.

23
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:39,291
I was born in that farmhouse,
and I'll die there too.

24
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,325
- But not quite yet!
- OK, thank you very much.

25
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:44,484
Thanks very much, all of you.

26
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:47,726
I'm mixed up,
you've confused me now.

27
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,001
Yes, I've always gleaned.

28
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,766
I remember, with my grandmother
and my brothers and sisters.

29
00:02:57,225 --> 00:03:01,979
Before, during the war, they had
to glean, they were starving.

30
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:05,222
They pounded the grain
to make flour,

31
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,067
for bread.

32
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:11,655
We no longer pick these days,
we no longer glean to eat.

33
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:15,200
There are still
a few gleaners of corn around.

34
00:03:19,944 --> 00:03:21,738
Gleaning might be extinct

35
00:03:21,956 --> 00:03:25,814
but stooping has not vanished
from our sated society

36
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,422
Urban and rural gleaners
all stoop to pick up

37
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:32,143
There's no shame,just worries

38
00:03:32,393 --> 00:03:34,823
Yeah, food, grub

39
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:38,337
It's bad, sad, man

40
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:40,985
To bend down is not to beg

41
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:44,394
But when I see them sway
My heart hurts!

42
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:47,178
Eating that scrap-crap

43
00:03:47,564 --> 00:03:49,962
They've got to live on shit-bits

44
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:52,840
They've got to frisk for tidbits

45
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:55,561
Left on the street, leftovers

46
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:58,272
Rough stuff with no owners

47
00:03:58,491 --> 00:04:01,118
Picking up trash like
the streetsweeper

48
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:03,809
Zero for us, for them much better

49
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:07,082
They got to roam around
to kill the hunger

50
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,972
It's always been the same pain
will always be the same game.

51
00:04:17,311 --> 00:04:20,501
In the towns today
as in the fields yesterday

52
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:24,359
gleaners still humbly stoop
to glean.

53
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:27,602
But men have now joined
with women

54
00:04:28,405 --> 00:04:29,614
in gleaning.

55
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,734
What strikes me is
that each gleans on his own.

56
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,163
Whereas in paintings

57
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:41,719
they were always
in clusters, rarely alone.

58
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,472
But there's a famous one

59
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:48,330
painted byJules Breton
at the museum in Arras.

60
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:52,167
We took the road north.

61
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:56,014
Lots of big trucks,
but I'll come back to that,

62
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:59,121
and we arrived in the town of Arras,

63
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:00,935
we saw its square,

64
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,635
we saw its museum,

65
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:05,137
and Breton's Woman Gleaning.

66
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:10,392
There is another woman gleaning
in this film, that's me.

67
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:21,872
I'm happy to drop the ears of wheat
and pick up my camera.

68
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,656
These new small cameras,

69
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:27,085
they are digital, fantastic.

70
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,327
Their effects are stroboscopic

71
00:05:29,952 --> 00:05:31,120
narcissistic,

72
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:33,497
and even hyper-realistic.

73
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,501
No, it's not O rage,

74
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:23,618
no, it's not O despair,

75
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,308
it's not Old age, my enemy,

76
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:30,927
it might even be Old age, my friend
but still, my hair

77
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:34,691
and my hands keep telling me
that the end is near.

78
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:41,405
OK, right now,
we are driving towards Beauce,

79
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,877
renowned for its wheat.
The harvest being over

80
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,151
we'll focus on potato
gleaning instead.

81
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,155
Destalking the fields makes furrows

82
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:55,627
and ridges ready
for the grubbing machine.

83
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:01,654
Once the grubbing is over,

84
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,875
we can glean the whole field.

85
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:07,847
- Hello.
- Hello Mrs. Buard.

86
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:12,956
Since this morning,
I've collected a full 250 lbs alone.

87
00:07:13,384 --> 00:07:17,304
And these are good ones
you eat with herring.

88
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:19,952
Lots of restaurants buy them.

89
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:26,521
Some people are quite pleased
when the machine malfunctions.

90
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:30,212
There are lots left here.

91
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,486
The tractor ploughs too deep
and gets stuck.

92
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,043
They free it by lifting the machine
and they miss potatoes there.

93
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:41,212
So gleaners have a field day?

94
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:42,943
Oh yes definitely.

95
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,602
The owners don't give a damn

96
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,032
so long as there's nothing left.

97
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,971
They won't have to treat.

98
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,619
You still must sort them.

99
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:04,619
In supermarkets,
the firm ones are sold

100
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:08,477
in containers of 5 1 /2 to 1 1 pounds,

101
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:12,064
and these have to be
of a specific caliber,

102
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,525
of a specific size.

103
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,913
So we dump anything bigger.

104
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:24,034
The potato harvest
averages 4,500 tons per season.

105
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:27,516
But 25 tons are rejected

106
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,571
and dumped.

107
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:52,102
We reject all the outsized,
green ones, and stones,

108
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,094
the cut or damaged ones.

109
00:08:55,345 --> 00:08:57,399
Because they're unsellable.

110
00:08:57,576 --> 00:09:01,288
To the trade, we sell potatoes

111
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:04,666
within a range of 2 to 4 inches

112
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:08,847
and anything bigger
is automatically thrown away.

113
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:12,183
Potatoes remain
a staple foodstuff for many

114
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:16,563
and because large quantities
of potatoes are dumped,

115
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,586
the practice of gleaning
has reappeared.

116
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:22,725
In general people wait nearby

117
00:09:22,902 --> 00:09:24,633
and follow the trailers.

118
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,992
We followed the trailers
but didn't see anyone

119
00:09:30,795 --> 00:09:32,943
except a man who might have known,

120
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,092
not through a newspaper though
for they never announce

121
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:40,116
dumping here tomorrow,
there next week.

122
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:43,108
Potatoes left in the open like that

123
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:46,904
soon become green
and dangerous to eat.

124
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:51,387
Sometimes the children give
the signal.

125
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:53,618
Hey, we found a big one here!

126
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,167
C'mon, catch it!

127
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:03,419
Monday, potatoes

128
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:05,338
Tuesday, potatoes

129
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:08,361
Wednesday, potatoes again

130
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,260
Thursday, potatoes

131
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:13,481
Friday, potatoes

132
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:16,161
Saturday, potatoes again

133
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:19,977
Sunday, potatoes au gratin

134
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:25,242
Look, I've picked up more or less

135
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:27,849
200 or 300 pounds.

136
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:33,312
You find very large ones
in the leftovers.

137
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:35,710
The damaged ones we leave.

138
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:39,850
Some are too small,
we take the large ones rather.

139
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:42,456
See,

140
00:10:43,718 --> 00:10:44,656
misshapen ones,

141
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,032
heart-shaped ones.

142
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,816
The heart, I want the heart!

143
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,422
I was glad.

144
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:53,529
I immediately filmed them up close,

145
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,325
and set about filming
perilously with one hand

146
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:01,453
my other hand
gleaning heart-shaped potatoes.

147
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:14,507
Then I took a few home with me.

148
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:20,169
I looked at them again,
filmed them again.

149
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,066
Then it dawned upon me:
the Good Heart Charity Meals.

150
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:35,444
Why not organize an expedition

151
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:37,227
on the day the potatoes

152
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,270
are to be dumped?

153
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:45,255
When I think of all the food gone
bad that's enough to make me mad

154
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:49,321
If you've been kicked out
and you're down and out

155
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,939
Then you need food for nought

156
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:54,785
I take a few for me and my kids,

157
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,457
and we collect together.

158
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:06,025
I've joined the Charity Meals
because I was unemployed.

159
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:09,612
I still am but I expect
to start on a trial job soon

160
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:13,991
and meanwhile, I'd rather
help people than do nothing,

161
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:16,493
help people in dire straits.

162
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:19,037
I'm a single mother.

163
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,427
I get food from the Red Cross
and the Charity Meals.

164
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:27,900
When I see all this go to waste

165
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:31,184
and that some people
have nothing to eat,

166
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:33,196
it's really disgraceful.

167
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:38,910
On that day
they collected almost 7 00 lbs.

168
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:41,652
At least that's something.

169
00:12:51,255 --> 00:12:53,997
A little later,
almost on the same spot,

170
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:56,291
we saw a man approaching.

171
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,859
I went over to him and asked him

172
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:04,653
how much he thought there was.

173
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:11,284
Almost a ton if you add
all the mounds together,

174
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:14,423
a ton of potatoes wasted.

175
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:18,218
Same thing with cauliflowers,

176
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:21,200
fruit and vegetables
in other regions,

177
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:24,933
but here it's potato country,
and we take what we find.

178
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:30,042
We're better off working
in the fields than shoplifting.

179
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:34,317
It's the same for all of us,
I'm not alone.

180
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:37,142
We get by as best we can.

181
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:40,270
We do potatoes,
we look in trash cans,

182
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:43,680
that keeps me going for now.

183
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:46,297
It's a hard life, that's all.

184
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:48,935
The year 2K is upon us, great, heh?

185
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,140
OK, I'm on my way with my 7 0 lbs,

186
00:13:57,912 --> 00:14:02,020
and there are several tons left,
which could be picked,

187
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:06,086
but people don't know
where to come to. There you are.

188
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,072
They are hoboes in caravans.

189
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:28,451
We are gypsies, we travel around.
They're different from us.

190
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:35,030
It needs to be cut up
for the scrap merchant to come.

191
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:39,868
We don't have the necessary tools.
No electricity,just candles.

192
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,953
What do you do for water?

193
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,444
What?

194
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:47,104
Water?
That's all we have. It's over there.

195
00:14:48,147 --> 00:14:50,858
That's our tap.

196
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:55,279
- What if it freezes?
- If it freezes...

197
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,074
we pad around the pipe,
or we let it drip

198
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:02,754
to stop it freezing
when it gets really cold,

199
00:15:02,942 --> 00:15:07,655
like last year,
when it got to -7 0F on the ground.

200
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:09,782
You get used to it.

201
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:22,586
You seem to like beer?

202
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:25,203
I'd drink anything.

203
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,392
How many beers is that?

204
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:29,478
I drink a pack a day.

205
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:32,470
- What?
- Yeah, a pack of 2 4 a day.

206
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:34,180
2 4 or even 3 2.

207
00:15:37,277 --> 00:15:39,351
Tell me what happened to you.

208
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:42,000
Did you have a house before?

209
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:44,502
Yeah, I had a job.

210
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:47,495
I worked impossible hours,

211
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:49,663
21 or 22 hours a day.

212
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,384
- Truck driving?
- Yeah.

213
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:52,927
- A trucker?
- Yes.

214
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:55,982
I drove long vehicles.

215
00:15:56,753 --> 00:16:00,861
Then one day the police
breathalyzed me and then...

216
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:04,438
that's how I lost my job.

217
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:10,172
Then my wife left me,
she took my three kids with her,

218
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:13,550
and I was in free-fall after that.

219
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:15,229
Divorce, everything?

220
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:19,368
Yes, and I haven't seen my kids
for almost 2 years.

221
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:21,871
They're 500 miles away from me.

222
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,883
I can't go and see them.

223
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:26,219
I don't have a car or a license.

224
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,409
- It's terrible.
- Yes it is.

225
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:32,370
I think of them every single day.

226
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:39,262
- Here's Guilene.
- She'll tell you everything.

227
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:43,537
Did you know that once
they're through picking potatoes,

228
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:46,603
you're allowed to take leftovers?
- No.

229
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:48,938
You didn't know?

230
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:51,691
- It's not allowed.
- Yes it is!

231
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,892
I have something
very important to say:

232
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:59,093
Why has the Mayor put us here,
I've been here four years,

233
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:01,419
and now he wants us to go.

234
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:04,453
He says he was fed up
with us gypsies,

235
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,518
but I want to stay here.

236
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:11,094
I had an apartment
but it cost too much.

237
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,233
Her first trailer cost her $3 50

238
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:16,245
and the latest one,

239
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,113
where I am housed at the moment,
$3 5.

240
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:22,428
We met

241
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:26,505
when I was working
in a cafe as a cleaning woman,

242
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,559
that's how we met.

243
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:34,721
So long as there's welfare
money left, OK, but after...

244
00:17:35,774 --> 00:17:38,099
we have to get by somehow.

245
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:41,050
Then we have to beg

246
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:43,490
and forage through the trash.

247
00:17:44,157 --> 00:17:47,483
We find food in the garbage.

248
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:48,672
Good food?

249
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:53,582
We're badly off. We do find
good food. Which could still be

250
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:58,420
sold in shops. But they have to
change their shelves.

251
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,205
We take advantage of that,
it's a lucky draw.

252
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,105
But we have to comb
all the garbage cans everywhere

253
00:18:06,313 --> 00:18:07,940
to recover stuff.

254
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:09,545
See for yourself.

255
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,136
For the soup!

256
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:23,017
My bunch of flowers!

257
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:26,655
- Another cucumber.
- Sure, there's plenty.

258
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:29,856
That comes from the trash.

259
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:34,037
The expiry date is 1 1 -29,
two days ago.

260
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:36,018
- One day ago.
- Right.

261
00:18:36,196 --> 00:18:40,794
That's still valid for seven
or eight days, a week or so.

262
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:44,474
I've got fish which I found there.

263
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:47,290
It's good until 1 2-2 4.

264
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:49,020
We found it in the trash.

265
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:53,973
We're not afraid to get our
hands dirty. You can wash hands.

266
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:02,001
Hey, guys, the new appetizer

267
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:05,494
is lamb kidney in a chicory
root sauce

268
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:08,862
with a potato fritter

269
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,407
and an aniseed and nut soup

270
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,087
and mushroom mousse
with truffle oil.

271
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:21,311
As I watched all this cooking,

272
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:25,315
I asked the chef
if there were lots of leftovers, and

273
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:27,088
what he did with them.

274
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:29,069
Nothing should be wasted.

275
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:32,655
With the leftover lentils,
we make a lentil soup,

276
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,272
we mince the greenery into a gratin,

277
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,556
the meat bones we use for stock

278
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,694
the fish bones for sauce.

279
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:43,301
We don't throw anything away.

280
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:46,783
You have to be economical.

281
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:51,433
If I had to buy all the herbs
I pick daily on the hills...

282
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:54,718
A small bunch of savory
like this is $1 .50

283
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:57,596
and we use about 20
of them every day.

284
00:19:57,783 --> 00:20:00,452
We'd be spending a fortune on herbs.

285
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,548
Anyway, I love picking them.

286
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:10,399
That nice inventive and thrifty chef

287
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:13,329
offers a gourmet menu for $1 00.

288
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:17,020
Edouard Loubet
is the youngest French chef

289
00:20:17,197 --> 00:20:19,762
to have earned 2 stars
in the Michelin guide,

290
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:22,171
now called the Red Guide.

291
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:26,790
Surprisingly enough,
Edouard is also a born gleaner,

292
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,948
or rather a born picker.

293
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:34,057
With his hat on, in his shirt sleeves,
he looks like a Provencal figurine.

294
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:39,489
Don't tread on the apples!

295
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,837
We take what
the farmers leave behind

296
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:46,767
or we pick the ripe fruit
on the trees.

297
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:49,718
This is the best thing you can use

298
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:52,960
to make good spirits
or good fruit jelly.

299
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,985
I never miss the chance.

300
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,302
How come you, a chef, also pick?

301
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,378
Firstly because
my grandparents taught me to

302
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,287
along fields and roads,

303
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:12,364
and also because

304
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:16,743
I then know what produce I get
and where I get it from.

305
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:19,955
I don't want
refrigerated produce from Italy

306
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:24,198
which is sold only when someone
feels like saying it is ripe.

307
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:28,609
As we're talking grapes and wine...

308
00:21:28,963 --> 00:21:30,100
Let's go, Isa!

309
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:32,466
...we might as well go to
a wine area.

310
00:21:32,654 --> 00:21:34,760
We're off to Burgundy.

311
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:42,288
On the road,
there are trucks, lots of trucks,

312
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:46,146
of the kind we loved
when we were kids.

313
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:49,066
We pass them and gaze at them.

314
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:52,996
Here's a very big one
passing us, transporting cars,

315
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:55,499
and here's another one.

316
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:02,453
And now we are passing him,

317
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:05,112
we struggle a little
to pass this one.

318
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:07,093
It's like a child's game.

319
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:13,286
We're arriving in Burgundy.

320
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:17,040
Beaune to me
is above all the Hospices

321
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:19,438
and the painting by Van der Weyden,

322
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:21,596
The LastJudgment.

323
00:22:24,808 --> 00:22:28,926
The Archangel Michael weighs
and judges the deeds of the dead.

324
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:34,671
The ones who are light
are to be resurrected,

325
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:38,498
and the heavy ones
are to suffer in hell.

326
00:23:23,738 --> 00:23:28,076
The grape harvest is over,
and yet nobody is in sight.

327
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:29,515
Why is that?

328
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:33,331
If you want your wine
to be ranked as vintage,

329
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:35,593
the yearly production is limited.

330
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:38,690
That means you can only produce

331
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:41,964
a certain quota per plot.

332
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,208
Growing up, I didn't hear
much about pickers.

333
00:23:47,396 --> 00:23:52,224
Wine growers have always
protected themselves against them,

334
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:55,602
for if you let people
pick in your vines,

335
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:58,657
how can you be sure they are not

336
00:23:58,907 --> 00:24:01,451
going to pick on a large scale?

337
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:08,479
These vintage vines
have been entirely harvested

338
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:13,139
and the surplus has been
deliberately left on the ground.

339
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,611
They're drying out,
lost for everybody.

340
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,792
It's a measure to protect
our profession and capital.

341
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,786
What you see here,

342
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:28,883
is called second
generation grapes, verjuice,

343
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,856
or conscripts,
depending on the area.

344
00:24:34,326 --> 00:24:35,567
Conscripts.

345
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:37,099
Like soldiers?

346
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:42,354
Exactly, like conscripts.
Some people pick them.

347
00:24:43,303 --> 00:24:46,421
It's a second harvest
and yields a cheaper wine

348
00:24:46,608 --> 00:24:48,412
called wine of the pickings.

349
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:53,031
- Will it taste of Pommard?
- No, not at all.

350
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:58,015
It makes a table wine,
a really cheap table wine.

351
00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:02,915
The vintage wine region
is not a good one for picking.

352
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:08,348
Gleaning, or picking,
is forbidden in Burgundy.

353
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:11,059
It ended 3 or 4 years ago.

354
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:13,530
It's sad, but that's the way it is.

355
00:25:14,468 --> 00:25:16,793
Gleaning was lovely.

356
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:20,620
We would see the gleaner,
tramping along,

357
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:22,225
Gathering the relics

358
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:26,052
Of that which is falling
Behind the reaper...

359
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:28,033
- Do you know?
- Du Bellay?

360
00:25:28,387 --> 00:25:30,441
- Right?
- It is.

361
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:33,079
Impressive, you know it by heart!

362
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:37,125
I took over my father's estate.

363
00:25:40,743 --> 00:25:43,516
From the grape to the bottle,

364
00:25:43,694 --> 00:25:45,768
I am the only master on board.

365
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,157
I have no cellarman,
no head cellarman.

366
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:56,883
With Nadine, we choose the best
blends for our Chateau bottles.

367
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,521
- Do you both choose?
- We both do.

368
00:26:00,814 --> 00:26:02,128
Jean Laplanche,

369
00:26:02,586 --> 00:26:03,942
a keen wine grower,

370
00:26:04,505 --> 00:26:07,560
has another calling, psychotherapy.

371
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:12,627
I am a practicing therapist,
but above all a theoretician,

372
00:26:12,815 --> 00:26:15,244
or rather a philosopher of therapy.

373
00:26:16,047 --> 00:26:17,475
What's your theory?

374
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,480
What distinguishes me,
is that I have tried to integrate

375
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:25,858
into man's psyche,

376
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,802
the Other above the Ego, i.e.
I developed an anti-ego philosophy,

377
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:35,566
a philosophy which shows
how man first originates

378
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:37,578
in the Other.

379
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:40,049
He copes with his double life?

380
00:26:40,226 --> 00:26:42,374
- Rather well.
- He's good, isn't he?

381
00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:46,524
- Rather well.
- He's intelligent, I think. And modest.

382
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:48,672
It keeps me going.

383
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:51,883
- Isn't it daunting for you?
- What is?

384
00:26:52,238 --> 00:26:55,042
That he is a therapist
and makes wine too.

385
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:58,587
I was analyzed
so as to learn a little more.

386
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:00,235
- By him?
- No, by Lacan.

387
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:02,800
- Ages ago.
- I was very young.

388
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:04,676
A long time ago.

389
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:06,908
We'll be married 50 years

390
00:27:07,606 --> 00:27:09,139
in the year 2000.

391
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:13,038
Tell me how you met.

392
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,345
At a village dance,
where most people meet.

393
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:19,816
- The kiss!
- Right...

394
00:27:19,993 --> 00:27:22,495
No one's interested in that!

395
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:27,719
I must tell you something,

396
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,951
something the whole world
should know about.

397
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,912
I met him,
it was like a lightning bolt.

398
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:35,080
You see?

399
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:39,428
The way he was dressed,
I couldn't possibly miss him.

400
00:27:40,523 --> 00:27:43,640
He had a red cap on, honest,

401
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,977
he was back from the Riviera.
He looked so...

402
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:50,188
He had a red cotton cap,

403
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,212
a green shirt,

404
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:56,757
mustard yellow pants,

405
00:27:56,945 --> 00:27:59,405
rope espadrilles and...

406
00:27:59,582 --> 00:28:01,042
- Yellow ones!
- Right.

407
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:05,943
And a multicolored belt.
I couldn't miss him,just couldn't.

408
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:10,853
How was she dressed?

409
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:14,951
That I can't remember.
Yeah, it's the old story.

410
00:28:15,306 --> 00:28:18,955
But I didn't fall
for her right away.

411
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:21,113
It all came later with me.

412
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:23,199
How mean of me!

413
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,182
Is it true, Huguette?

414
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,956
- I'm not in his heart.
- It's true.

415
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,129
This is Laurent, my son.

416
00:28:38,307 --> 00:28:40,663
A gleaner or a picker,
I'm not sure.

417
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:43,447
But I heard Glanum, not gleaning,

418
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:47,513
that's why I talked
about Saint-Remy, where Glanum is.

419
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:52,070
Gleaning, no.

420
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:56,251
Because gleaning is very different
from picking, you see.

421
00:28:56,428 --> 00:28:57,783
But picking, yes.

422
00:28:58,315 --> 00:28:59,869
What's the difference?

423
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:03,560
The difference is that
you pick fruit that hangs,

424
00:29:03,737 --> 00:29:08,085
that is hanging,
but you glean things that sprout.

425
00:29:08,262 --> 00:29:10,139
Like grain. It's different.

426
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,089
Olives and grain.

427
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:15,143
Almonds...

428
00:29:17,197 --> 00:29:20,190
Figs too,
people make jams out of figs.

429
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,015
The fig, you pick.

430
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,187
Look, nature's wonders!

431
00:29:28,364 --> 00:29:30,689
Overripe and beautiful!

432
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:40,157
That's fruit from heaven!

433
00:29:42,252 --> 00:29:45,766
I half-feel like interfering,

434
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:49,937
but it is none of my business,
it's their fruit.

435
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:55,880
This one's almost
pure alcohol, I'll be tipsy.

436
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:59,467
Anyway, half the people are stingy.

437
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:05,660
They won't allow gleaning because
they don't feel like being nice.

438
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:09,559
There's a lot left.

439
00:30:09,904 --> 00:30:11,989
The harvest is over now.

440
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,626
Are these not edible?

441
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:17,963
Edible, yes, but not good
for making candied fruits.

442
00:30:18,224 --> 00:30:21,279
Do you allow people to collect them?

443
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:26,075
No. I'm not the owner, but up to now,
it's never been allowed.

444
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:30,287
The harvest of the cabbages is over,

445
00:30:30,465 --> 00:30:32,863
only a few are left here and there.

446
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:35,886
These cabbages can be gleaned

447
00:30:36,074 --> 00:30:39,129
with absolute impunity

448
00:30:39,484 --> 00:30:42,017
by gleaners from Avignon or around.

449
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:44,655
Here are lovely tomatoes.

450
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,794
The machine couldn't take
what's too low.

451
00:30:48,523 --> 00:30:50,119
All these tomatoes,

452
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:54,717
which are just as red
as my bible, the penal code,

453
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,250
all can be gleaned.

454
00:30:57,709 --> 00:31:01,421
And it's not me,
it's the penal code that says so,

455
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,112
in article R-26.1 0. Here:

456
00:31:06,134 --> 00:31:10,888
gleaning is allowed
from sunup until sundown.

457
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:12,452
First requirement.

458
00:31:13,193 --> 00:31:14,850
The second requirement

459
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:17,666
is that gleaning
occurs after the harvest.

460
00:31:18,302 --> 00:31:22,159
And here, we can clearly see
the harvest is over.

461
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:25,016
Paging through
an old law commentary

462
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:27,383
I happened upon a decree,

463
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,283
or rather an edict,
dated Nov. 2, 1 5 54

464
00:31:32,815 --> 00:31:35,411
which says
just the same as the law today.

465
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:40,249
It allows the poor, the wretched,

466
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:44,556
the deprived, to enter the fields
once harvesting is over.

467
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:48,392
Old documents talk
of the poor, the destitute,

468
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,636
but how are we to consider
those who want for nothing

469
00:31:52,886 --> 00:31:54,899
and glean just for fun?

470
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:57,787
It's as if they needed
something too.

471
00:31:58,037 --> 00:32:01,957
If they glean for fun, it's because
they have a need for fun.

472
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:05,471
So if the requirements
and the times are adhered to,

473
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:08,328
they can glean as the poor used to.

474
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:09,715
Thank you.

475
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:12,009
Sure.
I'll take a walk in the cabbages.

476
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:23,040
I'll walk my small camera
among the colored cabbages

477
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:26,345
and film other vegetables
which catch my eye.

478
00:32:51,963 --> 00:32:55,185
On this type of gleaning,
of images, impressions,

479
00:32:55,372 --> 00:32:57,385
there is no legislation,

480
00:32:57,562 --> 00:33:01,826
and gleaning is defined figuratively
as a mental activity.

481
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,590
To glean facts, acts and deeds,

482
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,779
to glean information.

483
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:08,791
And for forgetful me,

484
00:33:08,969 --> 00:33:12,858
it's what I have gleaned
that tells where I've been.

485
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:17,560
From Japan, I brought back in
my case souvenirs I had gleaned.

486
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:28,591
I am back home, the cats are here,

487
00:33:28,904 --> 00:33:29,770
there's mail,

488
00:33:30,197 --> 00:33:32,898
one plant's died,
the others haven't.

489
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:37,110
Then I look at the leak
in the ceiling and the mold,

490
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,538
I got used to it.

491
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:41,322
I like it in the end.

492
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:44,315
It's like a landscape,
an abstract painting,

493
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:45,910
a Tapies,

494
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:47,682
a Guo Qiang,

495
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:50,060
a Borderie.

496
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,114
There's water dripping,

497
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:53,949
I open my suitcase.

498
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:27,376
Amazing,
in a department store in Tokyo,

499
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:29,545
on the top floor,

500
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:32,037
there were Rembrandt paintings,

501
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,101
original Rembrandts.

502
00:34:34,383 --> 00:34:36,635
Saskia, up close.

503
00:34:38,595 --> 00:34:40,670
And then my hand up close,

504
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:44,111
I mean, this is my project:

505
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:46,968
to film with one hand my other hand.

506
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:50,898
To enter into the horror of it.

507
00:34:51,076 --> 00:34:53,098
I find it extraordinary.

508
00:34:53,484 --> 00:34:55,590
I feel as if I am an animal,

509
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:59,459
worse, I am an animal I don't know.

510
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:04,818
And here's Rembrandt's
self-portrait,

511
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:09,614
but it's just the same in fact,
always a self-portrait.

512
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:16,881
Maurice Utrillo's

513
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:21,062
we saw in a very small museum

514
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:24,472
in the former City Hall of Sannois.

515
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,901
We were going

516
00:35:27,297 --> 00:35:31,040
to film nearby, at Herve's,
alias VR99.

517
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:34,940
In the year 2000,
his alias will be VR2000.

518
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,828
'Loading up'

519
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:43,156
means retrieving
heavy objects people get rid of.

520
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,408
To do so,

521
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:50,184
town councils and city halls provide

522
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:53,311
small maps such as this one.

523
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:57,034
It shows all the streets,
the districts and the days

524
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:02,779
on which one can go
and pick them up.

525
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:08,555
I think the maps show
where to dump things rather.

526
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:10,984
Yes, right, well,

527
00:36:11,162 --> 00:36:14,842
I read the map my own way because

528
00:36:15,478 --> 00:36:18,742
that's where I find my raw material.

529
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:24,768
I am, among other things,
a painter and a retriever.

530
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:27,792
I prefer night time,

531
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:33,944
and because I go by bike,
I can only carry small things home.

532
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:37,635
It'll be easier if I show you.

533
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,557
I make images
from salvaged material,

534
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,183
frames from wood,

535
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:49,114
I use food packages, slates,

536
00:36:49,677 --> 00:36:53,045
and then I also recycle

537
00:36:53,264 --> 00:36:57,049
my own packets of cigarette paper,

538
00:36:57,747 --> 00:37:01,386
and what's good about these objects

539
00:37:01,782 --> 00:37:04,775
is that they have a past,
they've already had a life,

540
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:07,621
and they're still very much alive.

541
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:11,062
All you have to do
is give them a second chance.

542
00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:21,092
All you need to do is
wander around, locate sites,

543
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:25,784
and then simply help yourself,
like in a real department store.

544
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,769
On site, you find heaps
of heavy objects,

545
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:34,720
it is best to get there quickly,

546
00:37:34,908 --> 00:37:37,264
because the competition is fierce.

547
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:39,912
Objects go quickly.

548
00:37:51,673 --> 00:37:56,053
They're like presents left
on the street, it's like Christmas.

549
00:37:58,148 --> 00:38:02,590
When I was a kid, my grandfather
used to salvage things as well.

550
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:04,081
He made piles.

551
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:07,949
I've always liked
the world of dumps and salvage,

552
00:38:09,273 --> 00:38:13,058
anything that's been
sort of discarded by society.

553
00:38:14,184 --> 00:38:16,124
It's like a cavern here.

554
00:38:16,343 --> 00:38:18,772
My own little cavern, that's right.

555
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:23,464
A place where I combine

556
00:38:23,787 --> 00:38:25,132
objects differently.

557
00:38:25,977 --> 00:38:27,958
I need to accumulate.

558
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,939
It's a shelter as well?

559
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,201
From what?

560
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:36,132
From emptiness.
Because it's full here.

561
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:42,670
I'm moving towards emptiness now,
or rather, towards lessness.

562
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:44,870
As much lessness as possible.

563
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:47,153
- You're still a long way away!
- I am.

564
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:50,844
Right now, I store up things

565
00:38:51,021 --> 00:38:54,358
because I know
I will need to recycle some.

566
00:38:55,025 --> 00:38:57,142
The encounter happens
on the street.

567
00:38:57,319 --> 00:39:01,281
The object beckons me,
because it belongs here in a way.

568
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:06,880
The encounter also happens
on the road,

569
00:39:07,234 --> 00:39:08,861
and it happened to us.

570
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:12,521
On our left, an abandoned factory.

571
00:39:13,157 --> 00:39:16,869
On the other side, a sign '' Finds''.

572
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:20,935
''Curios'' is common,
but '' Finds'' is more inviting.

573
00:39:28,108 --> 00:39:29,641
Hello, how are you?

574
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:31,549
Hello.

575
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:34,333
Turn and face me!
He won't.

576
00:39:36,595 --> 00:39:39,306
I spotted some wheat behind
that chap,

577
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:44,103
and behind the robot,
I discovered a painting on gleaning.

578
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:46,396
It contained both

579
00:39:46,615 --> 00:39:49,326
the humble stooping
of Millet's Glaneuses

580
00:39:49,545 --> 00:39:52,392
and the proud posture
of Breton's Gleaner.

581
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,968
The painter
had an old dictionary at hand.

582
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:59,690
Honest, this is no movie trick,

583
00:39:59,878 --> 00:40:03,725
we really did find these Glaneuses
purely by chance.

584
00:40:04,226 --> 00:40:08,980
The painting had beckoned us because
it belonged here in this film.

585
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:15,695
On the road again, off to the
Ideal Palace of Bodan Litnanski,

586
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:18,687
a much visited,
much publicized place.

587
00:40:24,057 --> 00:40:27,529
This retired brickmason came
from Russia

588
00:40:27,706 --> 00:40:30,282
and started building totem towers

589
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:32,909
made of scraps he found in dumps

590
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:37,205
and brought back in his trailer
hooked up to his moped.

591
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:40,156
It's solid stuff,
you know, very solid.

592
00:40:41,866 --> 00:40:43,815
I am a brickmason.

593
00:40:56,265 --> 00:41:00,498
I like dolls, they're my system.

594
00:41:00,685 --> 00:41:02,416
Dolls are characters.

595
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:10,392
What do you think of all this?

596
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:12,405
- He's an amateur.
- Sorry?

597
00:41:12,624 --> 00:41:13,865
He's an amateur.

598
00:41:14,188 --> 00:41:16,471
We can't stop him, we let him.

599
00:41:16,794 --> 00:41:19,046
But your husband is an artist.

600
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:21,142
An artist, well, maybe...

601
00:41:22,393 --> 00:41:24,093
Why not?

602
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,251
There's better than that.

603
00:41:26,428 --> 00:41:29,692
- What?
- Better, much better than that.

604
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:34,634
Like Louis Pons, for instance,

605
00:41:34,811 --> 00:41:36,959
who uses junk as an inspiration.

606
00:41:37,981 --> 00:41:39,931
He draws through objects,

607
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:41,766
he accommodates chance.

608
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:47,125
All these objects around here

609
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,566
are my dictionary,

610
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:52,516
useless things.

611
00:41:54,434 --> 00:41:57,739
People think it's a cluster of junk.

612
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:00,972
I see it as a cluster
of possibilities.

613
00:42:03,203 --> 00:42:06,988
Each object gives
a direction, each is a line,

614
00:42:07,175 --> 00:42:09,845
picked up here and there,

615
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:12,316
indeed gleaned,

616
00:42:12,493 --> 00:42:15,131
and which become

617
00:42:15,517 --> 00:42:16,726
my paintings.

618
00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:19,228
The aim of art is to tidy up

619
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:21,397
one's inner and exterior worlds.

620
00:42:21,574 --> 00:42:25,046
These are just crayons,
children's crayons.

621
00:42:26,412 --> 00:42:29,738
Here we have tins and spools...

622
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,398
This is the tongue of a small bell.

623
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:36,901
I make sentences from things.

624
00:42:38,382 --> 00:42:40,738
A cricket on a heap of trash.

625
00:42:42,553 --> 00:42:46,661
Cages are interesting too,
a bit like boats, like violins

626
00:42:46,827 --> 00:42:49,424
and things whose...

627
00:42:50,727 --> 00:42:54,022
shapes at first are very simple
and the same,

628
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:57,306
but the possible variations
are infinite.

629
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,122
These are skirting boards
and frames.

630
00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:04,115
There is a... from cars...

631
00:43:05,063 --> 00:43:06,304
a windshield wiper.

632
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:08,671
But for me they are streaks.

633
00:43:08,848 --> 00:43:11,663
I have to balance the streaks.

634
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:15,667
That's a statement.
Horizontal statements, nothing else.

635
00:43:28,961 --> 00:43:33,163
Again one hand filming
the other hand, and more trucks.

636
00:43:34,393 --> 00:43:35,665
I'd like to capture them.

637
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:38,345
To retain things passing?

638
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:39,846
No,just to play.

639
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:28,966
Noirmoutier is an island

640
00:44:29,185 --> 00:44:33,032
renowned for its causeway
and its oysters.

641
00:44:34,262 --> 00:44:36,410
People glean there

642
00:44:36,765 --> 00:44:40,174
after rough storms
and very low tides.

643
00:44:47,243 --> 00:44:49,600
Storms dislodge oysters
from their beds

644
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,716
and wash them ashore.

645
00:44:52,488 --> 00:44:55,897
But they all know
that around Christmas time,

646
00:44:56,075 --> 00:45:00,037
we are so busy
that we leave it to the gleaners.

647
00:45:00,735 --> 00:45:02,810
They go as soon as

648
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:05,177
the storm has abated.

649
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:17,574
A high sea over the beds
is a pretty sight

650
00:45:17,856 --> 00:45:20,035
but to profit from the low tide

651
00:45:20,254 --> 00:45:23,694
gleaners need a copy
of the Tide Tables.

652
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:28,595
We come every year
for the lowest tide.

653
00:45:28,991 --> 00:45:32,567
They're going to follow
the receding sea

654
00:45:32,745 --> 00:45:35,320
and anything they find they pick up.

655
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:51,940
People collect the oysters
that have come loose.

656
00:45:53,024 --> 00:45:56,569
In theory, they keep out
of the poles around the beds.

657
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:58,477
They must keep out.

658
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:00,917
They are too close.

659
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,910
Here the oyster farmers
let them carry on, but...

660
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:07,496
it degenerates sometimes.

661
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:09,863
We don't trespass!

662
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,887
The limit must be here, but...

663
00:46:13,095 --> 00:46:15,462
we encroach a little sometimes.

664
00:46:16,056 --> 00:46:19,278
We're not stupid.
We see others and do the same.

665
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:22,166
If they tell us anything, we scram.

666
00:46:22,594 --> 00:46:25,482
It's tolerated
but not really allowed.

667
00:46:25,795 --> 00:46:27,849
It's not downright illegal.

668
00:46:28,443 --> 00:46:30,873
There still exists a right to glean,

669
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,866
provided people glean
1 5 yards from the beds.

670
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:38,109
- 25 yards away.
- Is it 25 yards now?

671
00:46:39,057 --> 00:46:41,101
What are people allowed to do?

672
00:46:41,278 --> 00:46:44,375
To collect up to 7 pounds each,
nothing more.

673
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,430
- 1 0 yards away minimum.
- Right.

674
00:46:47,649 --> 00:46:49,234
1 1 pounds per person.

675
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:53,581
7 pounds of clams
and 1 1 pounds of oysters,

676
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,396
something like that.

677
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:58,211
1 1 pounds per person, I think.

678
00:46:58,951 --> 00:47:00,578
Three dozen per person

679
00:47:00,765 --> 00:47:03,330
but surely they take more than that.

680
00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:06,187
They pick up small inedible oysters

681
00:47:06,364 --> 00:47:10,181
that were churned
by the waves and are full of sand.

682
00:47:10,368 --> 00:47:13,246
People from the mainland eat them,

683
00:47:13,423 --> 00:47:15,404
and then say they get sick.

684
00:47:25,674 --> 00:47:27,958
TheJura region was flooded.

685
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:30,804
The river Dard barred our route.

686
00:47:38,301 --> 00:47:41,981
I liked it when
animals barred my way,

687
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:44,098
or I just stopped for them.

688
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:29,151
The Nenon family,
in the hills near Apt,

689
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,664
present a special case of picking.

690
00:48:32,018 --> 00:48:35,834
The vineyard they found
was wholly abandoned.

691
00:48:37,065 --> 00:48:39,796
That's a fully fledged harvest here!

692
00:48:40,328 --> 00:48:44,290
Yes, the entire vineyard
was left unpruned last year.

693
00:48:44,614 --> 00:48:47,700
An entire harvest
going to waste.

694
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:52,225
I spotted this place
and I was very intrigued by it.

695
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:54,414
Could anybody say anything?

696
00:48:55,989 --> 00:48:59,211
- Don't the owners care?
- No. After Nov. 1 ,

697
00:48:59,607 --> 00:49:02,975
we are allowed
to pick grapes in the vineyards.

698
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,813
If not, they're eaten
by wild boars or birds.

699
00:49:09,001 --> 00:49:12,369
- Do wild boars like grapes?
- They love grapes.

700
00:49:14,736 --> 00:49:16,195
On that day,

701
00:49:16,508 --> 00:49:18,833
I filmed dancing pruning shears.

702
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:21,065
I forgot to turn my camera off,

703
00:49:21,555 --> 00:49:24,714
which is why we get
the dance of the lens cap.

704
00:50:17,816 --> 00:50:19,756
The cap has stopped its crazy jig.

705
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,529
We're off to see the only owner

706
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,177
who cares for his gleaners.

707
00:50:26,053 --> 00:50:30,401
I warn children about the terrible
effects if they eat too much,

708
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:35,374
but I take for granted that the
adults know and I leave them alone.

709
00:50:35,593 --> 00:50:36,594
Jerome Noel-Bouton

710
00:50:36,845 --> 00:50:39,128
shows us an old photo of his vines

711
00:50:39,316 --> 00:50:41,672
which used to be Marey's.

712
00:50:42,058 --> 00:50:44,904
There is a mini-museum
in the cellar.

713
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:47,938
An engineer
and erudite physiologist,

714
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:51,515
Marey invented chronophotography.

715
00:50:51,692 --> 00:50:53,287
He was a visionary.

716
00:50:53,537 --> 00:50:55,446
He analyzed movement

717
00:50:55,664 --> 00:51:00,419
before Muybridge and the Lumieres.
He is the ancestor of all movie makers,

718
00:51:00,711 --> 00:51:02,723
and we're proud to be family.

719
00:51:03,808 --> 00:51:08,844
Marey was my father's grandfather,
which makes him my great-grandfather,

720
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:11,419
and to be more specific,

721
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:16,768
my grandfather
was Marey's son-in-law, since...

722
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:19,802
his wife, my grandmother,
was Marey's daughter.

723
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,014
She married a man named Bouton

724
00:51:24,191 --> 00:51:27,935
and this estate, which used
to be in the Bouton family,

725
00:51:28,122 --> 00:51:29,926
was bought by Marey,

726
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:35,139
and returned to the Bouton family
when his daughter married a Bouton.

727
00:51:35,327 --> 00:51:36,985
Congratulations!

728
00:51:37,204 --> 00:51:39,602
The tower you can see over there,

729
00:51:40,092 --> 00:51:42,167
he built with his own two hands

730
00:51:42,386 --> 00:51:44,961
to house his still camera equipment.

731
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:48,423
He set up wires and waited.

732
00:51:48,756 --> 00:51:51,843
Animals or birds went past,
triggering the camera.

733
00:51:53,553 --> 00:51:54,616
That's the hut

734
00:51:54,877 --> 00:51:56,430
from which,

735
00:51:56,858 --> 00:51:58,974
with his chronophotographic rifle,

736
00:51:59,225 --> 00:52:01,654
he broke down the flight of birds.

737
00:52:05,387 --> 00:52:07,920
That's Demeny, Marey's assistant,

738
00:52:08,264 --> 00:52:10,808
holding the rifle and the film reel.

739
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:15,177
I wonder who the boy
with a bowler hat is.

740
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:20,224
Marey's experimental pictures

741
00:52:20,828 --> 00:52:22,007
and film bits,

742
00:52:22,184 --> 00:52:26,115
technical prowess aside,
are pure visual delight.

743
00:52:54,402 --> 00:52:57,321
Our train leaves Paris

744
00:52:57,498 --> 00:52:59,438
and happens to slows down

745
00:52:59,688 --> 00:53:02,117
as we pass
Ivry waste collection center.

746
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:03,932
The heart of our topic,

747
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:07,862
since we're going to Prades,
home of our musician Joanna.

748
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,523
She met youngsters
who had had a brush with the law

749
00:53:12,909 --> 00:53:16,131
for damaging
the trash bins of a supermarket

750
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,342
because the contents
had been doused in bleach.

751
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,555
I thought I could film them
explaining the case

752
00:53:24,805 --> 00:53:26,953
if I met all the protagonists -

753
00:53:27,141 --> 00:53:29,873
the youngsters gathered
on the square,

754
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:32,073
the manager of the shop,

755
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,045
and the magistrate from the court,

756
00:53:36,535 --> 00:53:38,641
who seemed concerned and polite.

757
00:53:39,486 --> 00:53:42,437
I wanted to know how
these homeless

758
00:53:42,614 --> 00:53:44,209
coped with the law.

759
00:53:45,857 --> 00:53:48,734
Should squatting be legalized?

760
00:53:48,912 --> 00:53:52,071
I could work on it,
if not for this robe.

761
00:53:53,854 --> 00:53:55,835
But your robe is lovely!

762
00:53:56,012 --> 00:54:00,141
It was a simple case
of youngsters vandalizing things.

763
00:54:00,329 --> 00:54:02,268
I found them guilty of violence.

764
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:04,468
Before bleach was sprayed on?

765
00:54:04,645 --> 00:54:07,075
They'd knock over the trash

766
00:54:07,252 --> 00:54:10,588
and my staff had
to clean up after them.

767
00:54:13,862 --> 00:54:17,991
That led me to apply the law

768
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:21,296
and bleach the trash,
which they didn't appreciate.

769
00:54:21,828 --> 00:54:23,882
- We got angry.
- But nothing serious.

770
00:54:24,122 --> 00:54:27,073
We knocked over trash cans,

771
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:30,764
and damaged the wall
with graffiti and tomatoes.

772
00:54:31,181 --> 00:54:32,640
They broke the camera.

773
00:54:32,891 --> 00:54:36,331
It was locked,
we had to climb a little.

774
00:54:36,644 --> 00:54:39,115
They went over the fence.

775
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:42,097
They were trespassing
on private property.

776
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:45,204
Appearing in court
was itself a penalty

777
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,958
for these youths
who want to be free of all rules.

778
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:51,085
We only stole trash.

779
00:54:51,325 --> 00:54:55,673
The aim isn't to fine them
but to remind them of the law.

780
00:54:57,518 --> 00:55:00,709
They all played their part,
applying their own logic.

781
00:55:01,595 --> 00:55:03,847
The kids said
what they were supposed to.

782
00:55:04,024 --> 00:55:07,569
We filmed them with their dogs.
It was picturesque.

783
00:55:07,747 --> 00:55:10,937
I'm not that antisocial.

784
00:55:11,823 --> 00:55:14,180
- May I ask you how old you are?
- 22.

785
00:55:14,357 --> 00:55:18,986
Their beauty is poignant when you
realize that, for whatever reason,

786
00:55:19,226 --> 00:55:22,146
they get most of their food
from trash cans.

787
00:55:23,689 --> 00:55:25,628
In court, I was told

788
00:55:25,805 --> 00:55:29,027
it was a dialogue of the deaf,
but not of the dumb.

789
00:55:29,455 --> 00:55:31,300
They seized the chance
to have fun.

790
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:35,335
I said she was mad,
she cited me for contempt of court.

791
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:40,267
We said she was out of her mind,
and she would go: Write it down!

792
00:55:40,726 --> 00:55:43,541
Recorder, write down:
Out of her mind!

793
00:55:44,312 --> 00:55:48,514
We felt it was a foregone
conclusion. It was sickening.

794
00:55:48,702 --> 00:55:53,112
She opted for trial in closed court.
I shouted and slammed the door.

795
00:55:54,124 --> 00:55:57,836
They're not through
talking about this episode,

796
00:55:58,023 --> 00:56:01,766
and I'm not through thinking
about it in my hotel room.

797
00:56:01,954 --> 00:56:05,989
We filmed and continue to film
people who hang around trash cans.

798
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:08,450
They have various reasons
for doing so.

799
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:11,140
Each experiences it differently.

800
00:56:14,612 --> 00:56:15,863
- Hi!
- Here he is!

801
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,145
How are you?

802
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,617
Sit down, there's coffee for you.

803
00:56:21,681 --> 00:56:23,964
We had been told: '' He wears

804
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:26,508
rubber boots.
He salvages everything''.

805
00:56:26,863 --> 00:56:30,575
Yes, I live almost 1 00%
on things from the trash.

806
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,935
Everybody, rich or poor,

807
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:39,281
throws food away. Why?

808
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:42,127
Because we are so stupid with food!

809
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:46,819
If we're past the sell-by date
of a yogurt, people go:

810
00:56:47,007 --> 00:56:49,436
''Oh my God, I can't eat this!

811
00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:51,897
It'll kill me!''

812
00:56:52,085 --> 00:56:53,440
So stupid.

813
00:56:53,617 --> 00:56:55,630
It's easy

814
00:56:56,089 --> 00:56:59,279
to tell from the smell of it
if it's OK or not.

815
00:56:59,769 --> 00:57:03,940
It's quite simple, I've eaten
1 00% trash for 1 0 years now...

816
00:57:04,576 --> 00:57:06,901
for 1 0 or 1 5 years,

817
00:57:07,078 --> 00:57:09,612
I've never been ill.

818
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:12,083
- You don't have a job?
- I do.

819
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:16,535
I have a job, a salary,
a social security number.

820
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:19,288
So you are not forced to do that?

821
00:57:19,465 --> 00:57:22,061
Absolutely not.

822
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,961
Salvaging is a matter
of ethics for me,

823
00:57:26,315 --> 00:57:29,433
because I find it
utterly unacceptable to see

824
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,050
all this waste on the streets.

825
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:37,336
That proves we're heading for
disasters, like the Erika oil spill.

826
00:57:37,763 --> 00:57:38,900
Oil Slick

827
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,067
Put the head on the right.

828
00:58:04,966 --> 00:58:05,800
Looser...

829
00:58:11,128 --> 00:58:12,755
Sea birds,

830
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:15,539
guillemots, razorbill penguins,

831
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:19,469
all those who were smashed up
real good by Total Fina Oil,

832
00:58:19,824 --> 00:58:23,160
those who will get
smashed up real good

833
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:26,810
by this over-consuming society...
If they are cleaned,

834
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:30,146
the birds might still get caught
in nets,

835
00:58:30,334 --> 00:58:33,139
it's for them that I'm an activist.

836
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:35,714
All the rest can die
in their apartments,

837
00:58:36,068 --> 00:58:39,405
on their trash,
I don't care. Birds first.

838
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:47,131
Do you always wear boots?

839
00:58:47,308 --> 00:58:50,780
Yes, rubber boots have 2 advantages,

840
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:55,066
on this hostile ground,
they're really good stuff.

841
00:58:55,347 --> 00:58:58,089
There's a psychological aspect too,

842
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:01,384
with my boots,
I'm like the lord of this town.

843
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:03,449
All these idiots dump away,

844
00:59:03,626 --> 00:59:06,649
I come after them
and rake in the chips.

845
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:14,230
Trash is Beautiful!

846
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:17,952
An exhibition featuring
demonstration trash cans

847
00:59:18,129 --> 00:59:21,434
was organized to teach children

848
00:59:21,643 --> 00:59:23,488
how to sort out the trash.

849
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:34,436
At Trash is Beautiful,
they like colors,

850
00:59:34,968 --> 00:59:37,637
and children play with bits of junk.

851
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:40,400
This is just plastic
from the street.

852
00:59:44,612 --> 00:59:47,980
Gino Rizzi is in charge
of the kids' workshop.

853
00:59:49,513 --> 00:59:52,985
He himself transforms
pots of yogurt into flowers

854
00:59:54,903 --> 00:59:57,614
and plastic bottles into mobiles.

855
01:00:00,992 --> 01:00:04,089
Where does play end
and art start?

856
01:00:04,819 --> 01:00:07,978
Cartier Foundation
for Contemporary Art

857
01:00:11,502 --> 01:00:13,483
The American artist Sze

858
01:00:13,661 --> 01:00:17,133
exhibits mobiles
made with lots of bits and pieces.

859
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,523
The kitchen trash
has made it to the art world,

860
01:00:22,773 --> 01:00:25,922
where junk is highly-prized
and priced.

861
01:00:40,196 --> 01:00:41,750
In any case, museum trash

862
01:00:41,979 --> 01:00:45,722
is small, cute,
clean and colorful.

863
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:49,205
Have those kids ever seen
brooms in action,

864
01:00:50,675 --> 01:00:53,897
or shaken hands with
a garbage collector?

865
01:00:58,432 --> 01:00:59,642
- How are you?
- Fine.

866
01:01:02,154 --> 01:01:04,302
That's neighborhood life.

867
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:07,357
I live here

868
01:01:07,618 --> 01:01:10,808
at Mr. Charlie Plusquellec's,
because he's a friend.

869
01:01:11,684 --> 01:01:12,863
More than a friend,

870
01:01:13,248 --> 01:01:17,002
a protector, a godfather,
he's everything to me.

871
01:01:17,252 --> 01:01:21,412
I am so very very happy,
very glad, I am here

872
01:01:21,986 --> 01:01:23,341
surrounded by nature.

873
01:01:23,685 --> 01:01:24,624
You see,

874
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:27,262
it's worse than paradise.

875
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:31,505
Salomon is a little bit
like a migrating bird.

876
01:01:31,693 --> 01:01:33,945
He arrives, he moves in,

877
01:01:34,122 --> 01:01:37,115
and then one day, he disappears.

878
01:01:37,469 --> 01:01:41,045
And then he comes back again,
and then leaves.

879
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,976
So far he's been back 3 times.

880
01:01:45,883 --> 01:01:49,397
Every day, I come out of here,

881
01:01:49,783 --> 01:01:52,066
I wander around,

882
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:56,842
looking here and there
for throw-aways.

883
01:02:09,437 --> 01:02:11,939
Don't touch anything!

884
01:02:12,534 --> 01:02:14,515
- You hear me?
- Yes, Ma'am.

885
01:02:14,692 --> 01:02:17,267
Don't you understand what I said?

886
01:02:18,696 --> 01:02:22,929
Every morning, early,
you come across a little something.

887
01:02:23,669 --> 01:02:25,129
It's like a lottery.

888
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:31,176
It's good.

889
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,254
There's lots.

890
01:02:37,203 --> 01:02:38,548
Do you need it?

891
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:40,810
Wait, he might want some.

892
01:02:41,269 --> 01:02:42,802
Want some bread?

893
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:46,805
I always come here and help myself.

894
01:02:48,609 --> 01:02:51,112
Sometimes you get good cold meats,

895
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:54,354
sometimes fowl, a bit of everything.

896
01:02:55,845 --> 01:02:58,275
Salomon found

897
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,622
chicken legs.

898
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:06,866
So I'll cook
the meat before it goes off.

899
01:03:08,649 --> 01:03:12,059
You're going to eat
chicken and rabbit for a month!

900
01:03:12,444 --> 01:03:14,550
No, don't worry.

901
01:03:14,769 --> 01:03:17,929
We always find someone
to share with.

902
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:24,998
We give it to the neighbors,
the woman next door especially.

903
01:03:36,936 --> 01:03:38,104
That's good.

904
01:03:38,886 --> 01:03:39,981
Right now,

905
01:03:40,241 --> 01:03:42,222
we have 1 , 2, 3,

906
01:03:42,879 --> 01:03:46,393
4 fridges and 2 freezers

907
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:50,251
that we picked up and fixed.

908
01:03:51,544 --> 01:03:54,088
I patch them up, I fix them,

909
01:03:54,296 --> 01:03:57,247
and when the machine works
I sell it or...

910
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,062
I give it away to our neighbors.

911
01:04:11,062 --> 01:04:13,836
Fridges are everywhere
on the streets.

912
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,287
Sometimes they work, sometimes not.

913
01:04:19,268 --> 01:04:22,531
The Waste Ground artists
of Villeneuve sur Lot

914
01:04:22,782 --> 01:04:24,585
collects fridges

915
01:04:24,773 --> 01:04:28,965
and recycle them
as fully furnished, fitted spaces.

916
01:04:42,509 --> 01:04:43,760
Fridge Demo

917
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,285
Free our comrades!

918
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,908
My neighbor the Lion of Denfert

919
01:04:57,054 --> 01:04:58,889
is made of bronze.

920
01:05:00,432 --> 01:05:03,528
My friend the Lion in Arles
is made of stone.

921
01:05:05,019 --> 01:05:07,094
We got there in the early hours.

922
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:12,527
The people from the fair
were still asleep,

923
01:05:12,881 --> 01:05:16,489
and I saw a man
looking at the river flow by.

924
01:05:20,367 --> 01:05:23,276
I half-felt like talking to him.

925
01:05:31,326 --> 01:05:33,400
Further on, along the Rhone,

926
01:05:33,651 --> 01:05:35,246
in a blissful orchard

927
01:05:35,809 --> 01:05:37,759
I saw gleaners arrive.

928
01:05:39,427 --> 01:05:40,855
You can tell them

929
01:05:41,064 --> 01:05:44,672
from their boxes,
sacks and plastic bags

930
01:05:44,859 --> 01:05:49,509
which don't look anything like
the standard containers of the workers.

931
01:05:50,218 --> 01:05:53,649
My name's David,
I'm a foreman at the Cape farm.

932
01:05:54,806 --> 01:05:56,433
We often allow

933
01:05:56,683 --> 01:05:58,633
gleaners to come in

934
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:00,718
after our pickers

935
01:06:00,926 --> 01:06:03,637
provided they remain
1 0 yards behind.

936
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:09,205
Look, there's still
a lot left in the trees.

937
01:06:09,935 --> 01:06:12,260
We just take advantage of this.

938
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:16,295
I collect them
so that they don't go to waste,

939
01:06:16,483 --> 01:06:19,329
and I share them out,

940
01:06:19,507 --> 01:06:21,863
we stew them or whatever.

941
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:26,805
I want to pick them because
there're lots left as you can see.

942
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:29,839
I don't take damaged ones,

943
01:06:30,016 --> 01:06:32,644
because my children
are very particular.

944
01:06:32,832 --> 01:06:35,407
They're used to getting the best.

945
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:40,172
This one is damaged
so I chuck it away.

946
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:43,571
We gleaners also discard some fruit.

947
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:48,690
Here's an apple
which has got nothing going for it,

948
01:06:48,868 --> 01:06:51,641
it's like an ugly and stupid woman.

949
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:54,456
It's small and sunburnt.

950
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:56,823
Commercial value: zero.

951
01:06:58,335 --> 01:07:01,140
We can't prevent people

952
01:07:01,567 --> 01:07:05,498
from providing themselves
with apples

953
01:07:05,675 --> 01:07:08,251
once we have finished harvesting.

954
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:11,545
So we proclaim
an official gleaning period,

955
01:07:11,723 --> 01:07:14,267
we take car registrations down,

956
01:07:14,371 --> 01:07:18,156
if it's a moped,
we ask for a Xerox of the owner's I D

957
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:23,661
and we tell them from when to when
they can come and collect.

958
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:26,393
Isn't it a bit over-regulated?

959
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:30,261
Well, it's either that
or nothing at all.

960
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:35,203
Once people are registered,

961
01:07:35,453 --> 01:07:40,385
they can take 400 pounds, I don't
mind, even if it's a whole lot.

962
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:42,616
Good for them.

963
01:07:43,138 --> 01:07:45,849
In this field of 3 hectares,

964
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:49,467
at least 1 0 tons
will be left unpicked.

965
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:53,356
That gives the gleaners
quite a lot of exercise.

966
01:07:56,744 --> 01:08:00,633
You have to find them
behind the trees, under the leaves.

967
01:08:00,811 --> 01:08:03,000
It takes a while
to fill up a basket.

968
01:08:03,355 --> 01:08:06,827
Picking is not a piece of cake,
it's hard work.

969
01:08:14,939 --> 01:08:16,847
Quite a few have fallen here.

970
01:08:18,348 --> 01:08:20,642
You just have to pick them up.

971
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:27,450
Robert, a gleaner of many crops,
let us follow him.

972
01:08:40,546 --> 01:08:42,485
I'm looking for pine nuts.

973
01:08:43,048 --> 01:08:44,706
You're really thorough!

974
01:08:45,071 --> 01:08:48,575
Right, I really don't
let anything go by.

975
01:08:48,794 --> 01:08:51,984
In this greenhouse,
the tomato harvest is over.

976
01:08:52,339 --> 01:08:55,529
We pick the remains
before they clean the place.

977
01:08:56,478 --> 01:08:58,657
Here, see the tomatoes...

978
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,765
That's nature,
it shouldn't be wasted.

979
01:09:03,537 --> 01:09:06,946
It's abandoned.
Once the harvest is over,

980
01:09:07,123 --> 01:09:10,189
it's not worth
hiring people just for those.

981
01:09:10,356 --> 01:09:12,305
They'd rather let us do it.

982
01:09:12,827 --> 01:09:16,267
Can anybody go in the greenhouses?

983
01:09:16,445 --> 01:09:19,885
No, not the greenhouses.
I don't know what the law is.

984
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:23,535
Greenhouses are a facility
to grow vegetables.

985
01:09:23,722 --> 01:09:25,766
Once the harvest is collected,

986
01:09:25,943 --> 01:09:30,145
there's some left, a few tomatoes,
grapes, carrots or celery.

987
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:33,106
If gleaners remain within the law

988
01:09:33,283 --> 01:09:35,358
farmers can't say anything,

989
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:38,538
can't sue them for anything.

990
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,301
Even on their property?

991
01:09:40,488 --> 01:09:41,875
Even then, precisely,

992
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:44,721
gleaning is always
on private property.

993
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:50,821
Mr. Dessaud, our lawyer in the fields,
explained gleaning rights.

994
01:09:51,728 --> 01:09:56,410
Mrs. Espie, our lawyer in the streets,
tells us about salvaging rights.

995
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:07,055
The law on gleaning
doesn't apply to these objects.

996
01:10:08,108 --> 01:10:09,766
'' Res derelictae''

997
01:10:09,985 --> 01:10:11,580
are ownerless things,

998
01:10:11,799 --> 01:10:16,074
since the owner's intention
has been clearly expressed:

999
01:10:16,251 --> 01:10:19,275
they have deliberately
abandoned them.

1000
01:10:19,588 --> 01:10:22,476
Only the penal code
deals with their status

1001
01:10:22,653 --> 01:10:27,282
and says this property can't be
stolen since it has no owner.

1002
01:10:27,658 --> 01:10:32,454
Those who take the object
become its legal owners.

1003
01:10:32,704 --> 01:10:36,531
This acquisition is unusual,
since it comes from no one.

1004
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:40,670
Once taken,
the object belongs to them

1005
01:10:40,847 --> 01:10:42,797
irrevocably.

1006
01:10:43,391 --> 01:10:44,809
Thank you very much.

1007
01:10:44,987 --> 01:10:46,123
You're welcome.

1008
01:10:46,624 --> 01:10:49,251
Yeah. Sidelined beds on the sidewalk

1009
01:10:49,585 --> 01:10:52,358
Washed-out machines,
tired-out fridges

1010
01:10:52,535 --> 01:10:54,965
just bend down
and grab your furniture

1011
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:58,583
Yeah. Cookers,
cushions, club armchairs

1012
01:10:58,802 --> 01:11:02,722
Weary wood chairs and TVsets,
Worn-out couches

1013
01:11:02,941 --> 01:11:05,861
just bend over,you're made over

1014
01:11:06,038 --> 01:11:08,467
Street rehab and TVrap,yeah,yeah!

1015
01:11:08,853 --> 01:11:09,958
Broken TVs

1016
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:17,444
I've seen lots ofTVs abandoned,

1017
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:19,634
and within a few minutes

1018
01:11:21,938 --> 01:11:24,263
somebody was taking out the copper.

1019
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:32,782
It's the copper
from the deflector coils.

1020
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,830
I looked at the magic screen
thinking I began this film

1021
01:11:51,748 --> 01:11:54,177
right after the eclipse shown on TV,

1022
01:11:55,084 --> 01:11:58,598
continued while the countdown
to Y2Kwas shown on TV,

1023
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:02,706
and ended the film
on the 1 st of May...

1024
01:12:07,888 --> 01:12:09,348
Other people

1025
01:12:09,838 --> 01:12:13,550
take TVs home,
hoping to repair them.

1026
01:12:14,603 --> 01:12:18,387
I found 2 small chairs on the street
and took them home.

1027
01:12:23,413 --> 01:12:26,468
One night when the bulky refuse
is thrown out,

1028
01:12:26,645 --> 01:12:31,160
I drove around with Francois
who had done one of my film scores

1029
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:33,245
and who also sang.

1030
01:12:43,797 --> 01:12:46,914
He has dressed
in white for 25 years.

1031
01:12:48,562 --> 01:12:51,659
Francois is curious,
he likes rummaging,

1032
01:12:51,836 --> 01:12:54,568
but he didn't find anything
that night.

1033
01:12:57,466 --> 01:12:59,489
He looked at an empty clock

1034
01:12:59,656 --> 01:13:01,386
and he turned it down.

1035
01:13:02,648 --> 01:13:05,317
I picked it up and took it home.

1036
01:13:10,478 --> 01:13:13,700
A clock without hands
is my kind of thing.

1037
01:13:17,819 --> 01:13:20,561
You don't see time passing.

1038
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:48,984
I like filming rot,
leftovers, waste,

1039
01:13:49,474 --> 01:13:51,767
mold and trash.

1040
01:13:55,813 --> 01:13:57,919
But I never forget

1041
01:13:58,107 --> 01:14:02,517
those who shop in the leftovers
and trash when the market is over.

1042
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:15,707
It's past 2 o'clock.

1043
01:14:16,092 --> 01:14:18,835
I've done my shopping
and I linger on

1044
01:14:19,366 --> 01:14:21,306
until the market is over.

1045
01:14:23,328 --> 01:14:27,395
I notice a man with a large bag
eating on the spot.

1046
01:14:33,317 --> 01:14:36,716
I would see him now and then,
always with his bag,

1047
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:38,979
always eating.

1048
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:47,289
The day he was eating parsley

1049
01:14:47,539 --> 01:14:49,489
I went over to him.

1050
01:14:50,187 --> 01:14:52,127
Do you often eat parsley?

1051
01:14:52,304 --> 01:14:55,682
Sometimes yes. Parsley's
full of vitamin C and E,

1052
01:14:55,859 --> 01:14:59,717
beta carotene, zinc,
magnesium, it's excellent.

1053
01:15:01,698 --> 01:15:03,888
His answer amazed me.

1054
01:15:05,045 --> 01:15:07,996
Over the following weeks,
I filmed him

1055
01:15:08,277 --> 01:15:12,583
repeatedly, with or without sound,
and he talked in snatches.

1056
01:15:14,231 --> 01:15:16,587
I pick up food at the markets

1057
01:15:17,567 --> 01:15:20,414
and I save money that way.

1058
01:15:21,602 --> 01:15:24,449
I'm mostly a vegetarian,

1059
01:15:24,626 --> 01:15:27,055
so I find what I need.

1060
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:31,403
I don't make much,

1061
01:15:31,758 --> 01:15:33,416
but I still have to eat.

1062
01:15:37,993 --> 01:15:40,526
You should see what
they get rid of...

1063
01:15:43,727 --> 01:15:46,793
From the markets, I get fruit,

1064
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,492
vegetables mostly,

1065
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,620
sometimes cheese too,
but that's rare.

1066
01:15:58,867 --> 01:16:00,942
I eat a lot of apples.

1067
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:05,008
And here I can get
as many apples as I want.

1068
01:16:06,343 --> 01:16:09,742
- How many apples a day do you eat?
- 6 or 7.

1069
01:16:10,826 --> 01:16:12,671
Is it your staple diet?

1070
01:16:13,547 --> 01:16:15,455
I also eat bread.

1071
01:16:19,105 --> 01:16:22,139
I get up at 4, I take the train

1072
01:16:22,379 --> 01:16:27,008
and I arrive in Paris at 5:45.

1073
01:16:28,332 --> 01:16:30,407
Between 6 and 7,

1074
01:16:30,595 --> 01:16:34,442
they throw away all of the bread
from the day before.

1075
01:16:34,838 --> 01:16:37,612
If you spot
a trash can near a bakery

1076
01:16:37,789 --> 01:16:40,886
it's likely
to contain sandwiches, bread,

1077
01:16:41,094 --> 01:16:42,554
and all that.

1078
01:16:46,662 --> 01:16:51,343
I eat a lot of bread. It's a staple
food full of proteins and glucids.

1079
01:16:51,531 --> 01:16:53,721
It's strange to be concerned...

1080
01:16:54,075 --> 01:16:56,129
- About balanced diets?
- Yes.

1081
01:16:56,609 --> 01:16:58,798
Since I studied biology,

1082
01:16:58,976 --> 01:17:03,532
it's quite normal
I should be concerned.

1083
01:17:05,899 --> 01:17:08,610
I used to be a teaching assistant.

1084
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:11,884
When people find out
I have a Master's degree,

1085
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:16,471
they don't understand why
I sell papers to make money.

1086
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:20,579
I sell street papers or magazines.

1087
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:26,418
Most times in front
of the train station.

1088
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:59,022
I live in a shelter where 50%

1089
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,733
of the people are illiterate.

1090
01:18:02,369 --> 01:18:06,988
Immigrants from Mali
and Senegal mostly.

1091
01:18:08,145 --> 01:18:12,139
I arrived in that shelter
8 years ago,

1092
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:16,382
and I've been teaching them
to read and write for 6 years.

1093
01:18:16,903 --> 01:18:21,595
I am not part of the school system,
I don't get paid for it.

1094
01:18:24,035 --> 01:18:28,831
I teach every evening
from 6:30 / 7:00

1095
01:18:29,082 --> 01:18:31,334
until 8:30 / 9:00.

1096
01:18:36,526 --> 01:18:39,550
He arranged
and decorated the classroom himself

1097
01:18:40,144 --> 01:18:44,419
for the students who may attend
whenever they please.

1098
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:00,455
Ac, ec, ic, oc...

1099
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:02,363
And see, for example,

1100
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:06,575
a noc-turnal ac-tivity.

1101
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:12,039
Right, a nocturnal activity.

1102
01:19:12,258 --> 01:19:13,989
What does ''nocturnal'' mean?

1103
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,015
Success? Success is...

1104
01:19:20,192 --> 01:19:22,768
Isn't success like a behavior?

1105
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:25,885
It's to succeed in life.

1106
01:19:26,594 --> 01:19:28,398
Somebody who has succeeded.

1107
01:19:28,607 --> 01:19:31,495
- Like Celine Dion has?
- Right.

1108
01:19:31,912 --> 01:19:33,121
Famous?

1109
01:19:33,309 --> 01:19:35,738
But it's more like the will to...

1110
01:19:35,916 --> 01:19:37,052
Succeed.

1111
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,086
Yes, when you've succeeded,
that's success.

1112
01:19:43,329 --> 01:19:46,029
A use-ful... in-sect.

1113
01:19:47,009 --> 01:19:47,698
What's that?

1114
01:19:48,198 --> 01:19:49,585
A cockroach.

1115
01:19:50,596 --> 01:19:53,297
I don't know if it is useful but...

1116
01:19:53,974 --> 01:19:55,987
but it is an insect.

1117
01:20:02,045 --> 01:20:03,463
Meeting that man

1118
01:20:03,848 --> 01:20:07,498
is what impressed me the most.

1119
01:20:08,373 --> 01:20:12,085
And the time it took
to find out about his nocturnal

1120
01:20:13,211 --> 01:20:15,953
and voluntary activity
in a suburban basement.

1121
01:20:24,138 --> 01:20:27,464
The other high point
is quite different in kind.

1122
01:20:28,517 --> 01:20:30,874
I talked the Museum of Villefranche

1123
01:20:31,062 --> 01:20:33,136
into bringing out from its reserves

1124
01:20:33,491 --> 01:20:35,044
a painting by Hedouin

1125
01:20:35,232 --> 01:20:38,777
which I had seen
reproduced in black and white.

1126
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:42,948
Brigitte, the curator,
and her assistant,Julie

1127
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:45,492
had to disturb
several sleepy paintings

1128
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:48,589
before finding the one
I wanted to reveal:

1129
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:51,362
Gleaners Fleeing Before the Storm.

1130
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:06,439
To see them in broad daylight,

1131
01:21:06,616 --> 01:21:09,911
with stormy gusts
lashing against the canvas,

1132
01:21:10,088 --> 01:21:12,590
was true delight.
