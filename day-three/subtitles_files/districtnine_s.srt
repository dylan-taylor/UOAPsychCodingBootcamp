1
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:49,674
<i>Attention, Mr. Hayes,
your wife is waiting at the station.</i>

2
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:54,053
<i>Oh, it was after..
You know, after last year's corporate,</i>

3
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,681
my wife was always encouraging me,
you know?

4
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,226
She said, "No, you did fine
in the corporate." I was a bit nervous.

5
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,478
This little guy. Hello? Sorry.

6
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,813
- That's nice, eh?
- Yeah.

7
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,232
Nice background with the people.

8
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,902
- We are here at... Must I look in there?
- Look into the lens.

9
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,906
We are here at MNU head office,
Department of Alien Affairs.

10
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,200
My name is Wikus van de Merwe.

11
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,829
And behind me you can see
other Alien Affairs workers.

12
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,082
And what we do here at this department is,

13
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,628
we try to engage with the prawn
on behalf of MNU

14
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,340
and on behalf of humans.

15
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,635
<i>To everyone's surprise,
the ship didn't come to a stop</i>

16
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,723
<i>over Manhattan or Washington or Chicago,</i>

17
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:43,561
<i>but instead coasted to a halt
directly over the city of Johannesburg.</i>

18
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,443
The doors didn't open for three months.
Nobody could get in.

19
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,363
<i>They eventually decided, after much
deliberation, that the best thing to do</i>

20
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,200
<i>would be to physically cut their way in.</i>

21
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,582
We're gonna need a drill down here.

22
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:09,253
<i>We were on the verge of first contact.</i>

23
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,130
<i>The whole world was watching.</i>

24
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,506
We need some more light.

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,637
Expecting, I don't know, music
from heaven and bright shining lights.

26
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,431
Got a lot of moisture in here.

27
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,017
Yeah, just go slowly.

28
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,145
Oh, my God.

29
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,280
The creatures were extremely malnourished.

30
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,867
They were very unhealthy.
They seemed to be aimless.

31
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,037
<i>There was a lot of international pressure
on us at the time.</i>

32
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:47,541
<i>The world was looking at Johannesburg,
so we had to do the right thing.</i>

33
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,794
<i>The government then
established an aid group</i>

34
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,881
<i>that started to ferry the aliens
to a temporary camp that was set up</i>

35
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,467
<i>just beneath the ship.</i>

36
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,803
<i>We didn't have a plan.</i>

37
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,347
<i>There was a million of them.</i>

38
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,141
<i>So what was a temporary holding zone</i>

39
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,978
soon became fenced, became militarized.

40
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,938
And before we knew it, it was a slum.

41
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,317
<i>Well, the truth is, nobody really knew
what this place was.</i>

42
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,196
There's a lot of secrets in District 9.

43
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,543
At first, a lot of attention was given
to giving the aliens

44
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,254
proper status and protection.

45
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,840
They're spending so much money
to keep them here

46
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:40,219
when they could be spending it
on other things, but at least...

47
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,306
<i>At least they're keeping them
separate from us.</i>

48
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,645
I wanna be realistic with everyone.

49
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,067
- The aliens will not be able to go home.
- The aliens are here to stay.

50
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,031
<i>There were literally thousands of theories
as to why the ship seemed inoperable.</i>

51
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,784
And what was speculated was
that a command module had detached itself

52
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:07,538
from the main ship
and then somehow mysteriously become lost.

53
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,875
Did it fall by itself or
was it programmed?

54
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,210
I don't know.

55
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,880
<i>Examination of the old video footage</i>

56
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:20,427
<i>shows very clearly
that a piece falls from the ship.</i>

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,768
We looked everywhere. There's pieces
falling off that vessel for bloody months.

58
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,020
<i>More energy weapon caches found.</i>

59
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,106
<i>The special task force conducted raids
in District 9...</i>

60
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,902
Where there's a weapon, there's crime.
Tensions rose and rose.

61
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,280
People became more and more fed up,
and eventually the rioting started.

62
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,992
<i>Residents in Tembisa rioted
for the third consecutive night</i>

63
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:49,330
<i>in an attempt to remove all the aliens
from their township.</i>

64
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,312
<i>The government have enforced
a nationwide curfew.</i>

65
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,942
The derogatory term "prawn" is used.

66
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,945
Obviously, it implies something
that is a bottom feeder

67
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,697
<i>that scavenges the leftovers.</i>

68
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:28,202
You can't say they don't look like that.
They look like prawns.

69
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,455
<i>Aliens made off
with an undisclosed amount of cash.</i>

70
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,082
<i>One bystander was hurt.</i>

71
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,377
What for an alien might be seen
as something recreational,

72
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,755
setting fire to a truck,
derailing a train,

73
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,509
is for us, obviously,
an extremely destructive act.

74
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,023
<i>After 20 years, public pressure
had forced the government</i>

75
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,985
<i>to ship the aliens out of Johannesburg.</i>

76
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:05,072
They had had enough,
and they wanted District 9 to be moved

77
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,533
and more intensively
policed and controlled.

78
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,829
<i>To enforce this eviction, the government
turned to Multi-National United.</i>

79
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,873
Welcome all, and thank you for coming.

80
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,001
Please listen very
closely to this briefing.

81
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:21,589
Today we start a very complex
and delicate operation.

82
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,844
<i>This is the largest operation
that MNU has ever undertaken,</i>

83
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:31,098
<i>and we believe that it is going
to be undertaken successfully.</i>

84
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,268
It is to move 1.8 million prawns

85
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:40,024
<i>from their present home in District 9
to a safer and better location</i>

86
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,777
200 kilometers outside
of Johannesburg city.

87
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,614
<i>We've built a nice, new facility
where the prawn can go.</i>

88
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,783
<i>He can be comfortable. He can stay there.</i>

89
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,829
The people of Johannesburg
and of South Africa are going to live

90
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:58,167
happily and safely,
knowing that that prawn is very far away.

91
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:04,173
UIO protocol dictates
that we give the aliens 24-hours' notice

92
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,050
of our right to evict.

93
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,178
Today, you will serve these notices,

94
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,181
getting the aliens to sign the I-27 form.

95
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,644
The legality that MNU is using to evict
the aliens is simply a whitewash.

96
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:21,691
So I'm going to appoint a field officer
to take direct command.

97
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,401
Wikus van de Merwe.

98
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,446
<i>Everybody always said
that Wikus was not a very smart boy,</i>

99
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,448
<i>but he was a wonderful son.</i>

100
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,577
That was my Wikus. Just...

101
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,250
Yes. Like up on the big stage.
Thank you, Piet. Mr. Smit.

102
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:43,546
<i>I had to put aside the fact
that my daughter was married to Wikus.</i>

103
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,800
That didn't factor in my decision
to promote him.

104
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:53,347
It's almost as big as my wedding day.
You know, not as big.

105
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,641
Wikus was always making me things.

106
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,394
He said that way,
they just mean so much more.

107
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,814
He left this papier-mâché ball
on the sofa one day,

108
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,109
and I didn't see it
and I sat down and I...

109
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,402
I kind of squished it.

110
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,822
They took all his stuff away
for the investigation,

111
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,575
and I made them bring it all back.

112
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,869
- Congratulations, man.
- Oh, thanks, man.

113
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,455
- Okay, you're gonna go to P-7.
- Wikus. Wikus.

114
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,334
Leslie. How's it going, man?
There's the shake. P-9 for you.

115
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,420
<i>I'm not saying what he did was right.</i>

116
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,007
He took the choices
that were given to him.

117
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,634
This is Trent. Fundiswa, Trent.
Trent, Fundiswa.

118
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,137
- Hi.
- Fundiswa's the guy that I've selected

119
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,556
to replace me,
if he can make it today, eh?

120
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,349
- I'll make it.
- You think you can?

121
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:42,605
I just want everyone watching this
to learn from what has happened.

122
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:47,234
You would think things like this would
happen to somebody else, not me.

123
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,570
Guys, don't forget to pack
the stun grenades.

124
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,448
Tovi. There's Tovi.
How's it going, man? A long time, eh?

125
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,575
- You got my stuff?
- Hey, big boss.

126
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,327
- How's it going?
- I'm all right.

127
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,704
This is Fundiswa.
He's training with us today.

128
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,957
<i>I think I was...
"Disgusted" would be the word.</i>

129
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,629
There was always a hint of something
not kosher with Mr. van de Merwe.

130
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:11,342
Nobody saw it coming. None of us had
any idea of what he was doing.

131
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:15,888
I think it's a great thing that it's not
the military guys in charge this time.

132
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:20,476
Not to say Koobus and the cowboys
are not wanted. You're always wanted.

133
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,978
You see now? These are the cowboys.

134
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,772
- Get out!
- Fire!

135
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,232
They shoot first
and then answer the questions.

136
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,151
You can see... Hey, sorry, sorry.

137
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,612
That's above the allocated amount
of ammunition.

138
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,822
Your pouches are full,
but you still carry.

139
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,908
Maybe you should speak to the colonel.

140
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,868
I just think that you should...

141
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,080
FNG over here says
that we got too much ammunition.

142
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,500
All I'm saying, Koobus,
is that you should find ways

143
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,336
of making your guys more efficient,
you know?

144
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,131
Listen to me, you fuck!
Get that fucking camera out of my face.

145
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,925
Fucking <i>doos.</i>

146
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,136
There are rules.
We're all living by rules.

147
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,933
I don't think he can be forgiven
for what he did. It was like a betrayal.

148
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:05,020
I've gotta get going, guys. I think we're
gonna have to cut this. We're gonna go.

149
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,897
This is tangled. This is tangled.

150
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,025
- Move it, move it.
- Come on, let's go.

151
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,320
- Hurry up. Go on. Go on.
- Go, go, go.

152
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,454
<i>We've got four teams in the air
and three teams on the ground.</i>

153
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,997
Got a visual on the ground crew.
We can take it into position.

154
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,833
<i>Copy that.</i>

155
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,049
These are full. Check your magazines,
people. Come on. Let's go.

156
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:38,387
The prawn doesn't really understand
the concept of ownership of property.

157
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,766
So we have to come there
and say, "Listen, this is our land.

158
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,685
Please, will you go?"

159
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,150
It's difficult to put the vest on
by yourself.

160
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,486
- Thomas, can you help me?
- They told me I was going to get a vest.

161
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,948
Just look... Thomas, just look on the side
if there's a vest there.

162
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,493
- I'm concerned about my family.
- Look, don't worry. It'll be fine.

163
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,912
<i>Rights groups have
demanded that mercenaries</i>

164
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,458
<i>should comply
with all UIO regulations in District 9.</i>

165
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,920
<i>We're coming to you
from the entrance of District 9,</i>

166
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,591
<i>as today Multi-National United sets out
to relocate</i>

167
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:20,095
<i>approximately 1.8 million
alien residents from their homes.</i>

168
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,306
<i>Human-rights groups are keeping
a watchful eye,</i>

169
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,477
<i>as many suspect abuses might occur.</i>

170
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,370
<i>We're seeing heavily armed
private security forces</i>

171
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:51,294
<i>being deployed into District 9,
backed up by significant air support.</i>

172
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,931
We go shack to shack
and get them to sign the form.

173
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,059
First one, E-X-triple-seven.

174
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,646
<i>We're seeing the convoy stop,
and the operation is about to begin.</i>

175
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,360
<i>- Arriving at destination.</i>
- Just stay focused.

176
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,488
- You ready, Thomas?
- Yeah.

177
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,490
- Okay. Yeah, that's it.
- Here we go.

178
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,200
- Ready, boss?
- That's the signal.

179
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,577
<i>Doors will now open. Please mind the step.</i>

180
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,914
- You stay behind us. Good luck, boy.
- Sure, sure.

181
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,293
- No, no. Don't split up.
- Shit!

182
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,213
- Thomas.
- We've got the bastard.

183
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,383
Stay, stay, stay. Stay low.
Where is he going? What is he...?

184
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,801
Okay, Thomas, move away.

185
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,928
<i>It's clear that security is very high,</i>

186
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,806
<i>and it's only the beginning
of a total clampdown.</i>

187
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,145
We are here to assist you.

188
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,773
Move out. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

189
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,651
Let's go. Move out. Let's go!

190
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,819
This is MNU agents.

191
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,447
- Open the door, please.
- Open up, open up. MNU are here.

192
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,491
- MNU.
- Always hold your badge up.

193
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,744
Hello. Hello. Hello.

194
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,622
Okay. This is Wikus van de Merwe from MNU.

195
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,000
We are here to serve
you an eviction notice.

196
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,211
You just put your scrawl there.

197
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,422
Okay, all right. Thomas, hold it.

198
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,340
We've got the scrawl. As he hit it...

199
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,678
That's what I was saying,
it counts as a scrawl.

200
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:29,516
First time you come in, there'll always be
a little bit of tension between us...

201
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,227
Hey! Hey, food sack,
you can't eat that, man.

202
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,980
The prawn likes to eat the rubber.
Like a marshmallow.

203
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,858
No, no, no! Don't prod him.
Don't prod him like that.

204
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,069
Don't prod him.

205
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,154
Fuck.

206
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,031
You see that. Breaking the rules.

207
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,741
No, stay calm.

208
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:51,038
Okay, this is gonna be problems.
All the prawns are coming out.

209
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,458
They wanna see what's going on.
No, hey. Stop it! Stop it!

210
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,667
Horace, bring my <i>goed.</i>

211
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,961
See? Everybody's gathering now.
Don't shoot.

212
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,089
- You're gonna turn it into a war zone.
- What is that? Tear gas?

213
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,342
- Is that tear gas?
- No, it's cat food.

214
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,886
It's cat food. I just distract them.

215
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,139
Yeah, yeah. He got a bit close,
he was prodding a prawn and he...

216
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,058
He's lost his arm.

217
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,145
So we need a team down here
straightaway, please, man.

218
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,234
That's a pity, because you know this...

219
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,779
Hell, this is a nice cat food, you know?

220
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,950
But it's not your house,
so we'll give it to someone else.

221
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,494
We need you to sign there.
Okay, there it is.

222
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,581
Now you can take that. Okay, all right.
Thomas. Thomas, wait. Take it easy.

223
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,793
<i>The creatures became incredibly obsessed
with cat food.</i>

224
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,588
Something about that. It was like catnip
for cats, only a lot more intense.

225
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,091
Get down on the ground or I'll shoot!

226
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,677
Come on. Come on. That's it. Come on.

227
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,762
MNU are your friends.

228
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:53,684
Hello? MNU. We are here
to serve eviction notices. Okay?

229
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,560
Hold it, boys.

230
00:14:55,644 --> 00:15:00,357
<i>What we have stranded on Earth
in this colony, is basically the workers.</i>

231
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,736
They don't think for themselves,
take commands, have no initiative.

232
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,324
They've lost all of their leadership
through, we presume, illness.

233
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,083
- We are here for you.
- Keep your fucking hands up.

234
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,707
Holding stable
in the Nigerian compound area.

235
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,594
<i>Where there's a slum, there's crime,</i>

236
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,596
<i>and District 9 was no exception.</i>

237
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,057
The Nigerians had various scams going.

238
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,435
One of them was the cat-food scam

239
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,231
<i>where they sold cat food to the aliens
for exorbitant prices.</i>

240
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,160
<i>Not to mention interspecies prostitution.</i>

241
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,038
<i>And they also dealt in alien weaponry.</i>

242
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,707
You have a car hijacking,
there's a chop shop there.

243
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,959
See that? That's somebody's car in there.

244
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:05,338
The Nigerians in District 9 are headed
by a man called Obesandjo.

245
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:09,301
<i>He's a very powerful underground figure
in Johannesburg.</i>

246
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,220
Don't play with these boys.
He'll cut you in four pieces.

247
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,723
- He will put you on each side of...
- Boss. Boss.

248
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,727
That's the boss there.
Okay, no problems. No. Keep walking.

249
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:23,106
Don't look at him. That's gonna cause
problems. Trent, don't film here now.

250
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,068
Double up, baby, double up.

251
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:30,030
- All right, next, 766. All right.
- Now, this is the one.

252
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,325
- MNU agents. Open the door, please.
- Hey, hey.

253
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,118
- What?
- Jesus.

254
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,579
- Thomas. Check around the side.
- What is it?

255
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,415
Check around the side there. That's a...

256
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,250
Control, it's Wikus van de Merwe.

257
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,252
I need a population-control team

258
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:48,673
at JV-766, Zone 4 immediately, please.
Check that side, Thomas.

259
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,927
- There's 40 to 50 eggs in here.
- Is this normal?

260
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,179
- This is an amazing find.
- They're all gone.

261
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,515
I can just show you a little bit
how it works.

262
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,476
Basically, a cow is hung from the ceiling,
you can see here.

263
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,855
Very little of it left, of course, because
all these pipes supply the nutrition

264
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,399
to the little prawn eggs.

265
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,652
- You can do one, if you want.
- No, I'm fine.

266
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,364
You want to see? There you go. Okay.
No more nutrition to the guy.

267
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,575
- And then, finally, we take out that.
- Oh, God.

268
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,829
The little guy has gone
to a nice little sleep now.

269
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:22,666
Just pop him out. There we go.
And pop him out here.

270
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,253
You can take that. Keep it as a souvenir
for your first abortion.

271
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,547
- You can feel like you did one.
- Yes, boss.

272
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,216
Where's the team now?

273
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,844
Okay, here he comes, guys.

274
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,096
This is The Snake.

275
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,516
To go in and abort each egg one at a time
would take a very long time.

276
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,435
So this makes a lot of sense.

277
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,022
Do you hear that? That's a popping sound
that you're hearing.

278
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:50,944
It's almost like a popcorn.
What the egg does is, it pops up.

279
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,197
The little guy, what's left of him,
pops out there.

280
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,242
So that's the sound
that you are hearing with the popping.

281
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,996
You don't need that, man. Only
sissies wear that. You don't need that.

282
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,833
- You've been drinking a little bit, eh?
- Watch the suit, man.

283
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,586
What are you doing
with these television sets here?

284
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,004
What's this?

285
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,423
Hey. Smile for the cameras there, eh?

286
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,050
- That's a first-day find.
- That's a big find.

287
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,012
You see this? Look at this.
Trent. Trent, look at this.

288
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,722
There's weapons all over here.

289
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,433
TK-57572.

290
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,281
MNU is trying to move the aliens
for humanitarian reasons,

291
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:41,161
<i>but the real focus, just as it has been
right from the beginning, is weapons.</i>

292
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:45,749
<i>MNU is the second. Largest weapons
manufacturer in the world.</i>

293
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,752
We assumed that we'd be able
to pick up the alien gun

294
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,421
and be able to shoot it,
but it didn't work like that.

295
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,592
<i>As we discovered, their technology is
engineered in a biological manner</i>

296
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,719
<i>and interacts exclusively with their DNA.</i>

297
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,764
<i>So it just doesn't work with humans.
It's as simple as that.</i>

298
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,644
This is basically a guy
and there's three humans here.

299
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,979
Basically, trying to make a warning,
you know?

300
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,733
He's saying, "I killed three humans.
Watch out for me."

301
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,195
Hey, don't urinate on your own bloody...
Okay. Back up. Back up.

302
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,530
Back up, back up, back up. Guys. Thomas.

303
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:21,493
Control, this is Wikus requesting
First Battalion air support, please.

304
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:28,125
You want to talk to them or you want
to talk to me? Yeah, you can talk...

305
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,754
No.

306
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,219
Okay, guys, thanks very much.
Yeah, no, he had a spade.

307
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,904
To Control, van de Merwe unit.
This is Yankee-Foxtrot-5-3-0.

308
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:24,992
This is a dangerous area, you know.

309
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:38,546
Okay, now, you see, this is a problem.
This is a gang sign. You see this?

310
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,549
So again, looks like we have a...
Thomas, look sharp, eh?

311
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,468
Looks like we have more gang members.

312
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,152
Fundiswa, you just stay back.
You stay behind Thomas.

313
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,349
MNU agents. Open up!

314
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,809
Hello?

315
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,896
MNU! We're serving eviction notices.

316
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:59,150
MNU agents. Open the door, please. Hello.

317
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,445
We would like you to please sign...
That's unacceptable.

318
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,655
Move out! Move out!

319
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,658
- That is totally unacceptable!
- Get out, you stupid prawn.

320
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,452
- That's bloody rude. Get outside!
- Come on. Move!

321
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,121
- Move! Move!
- Get outside.

322
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,956
We tried to talk nicely with you.

323
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,377
I tried to talk nicely with him, I did.
Get him out to the front there, Thomas.

324
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,295
- Keep moving.
- Cheeky bastard.

325
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,047
You got something in your house?

326
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,966
- All the way, Thomas.
- On your knees.

327
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,219
- I'm gonna have a look.
- Just stay there. Right there.

328
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,847
Sir, we have to serve you
an eviction notice.

329
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,266
Do you understand that?

330
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,560
This is a classic kind of gangster shack.

331
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,020
I can tell you,
we gonna find weapons here.

332
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,648
Trent, watch your head.
Don't hit the cow's head.

333
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,984
Just checking for panels.

334
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,737
You hear that? Yeah, it's hollow there.

335
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,658
See? Look at that. Look at that.

336
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,577
I haven't seen this type of setup.

337
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:55,206
It's almost like a
chemistry type of a set.

338
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,501
There's gonna be something.

339
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,796
What is this <i>kak?</i>

340
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,800
What is this?

341
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,931
I don't know. This has got
the markings there of...

342
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,893
So it's definitely alien.

343
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:18,271
But it's not a weapon.

344
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,441
But I don't trust it.
You know, I don't trust anything that...

345
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,194
Are you all right?

346
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,614
- Wikus, are you all right?
- Cut it. Turn it off.

347
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,704
Just switch it off.
Turn it off. Turn it off.

348
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,707
You gonna just... You gonna cut that part,
Trent, out of this?

349
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,250
- Yeah.
- Where it sprays me.

350
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,460
We'll cut that.

351
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,297
We just found a dangerous object here.

352
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:49,260
It has a fluid in it that I suspect might
leak onto people or cause damage.

353
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,931
So we just check that in
and we take that down nicely to the lab.

354
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,016
It's not a weapon, but it's dangerous.

355
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,851
He's got weapons somewhere here.

356
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,104
My sense is telling me that.
Let's check the other side here.

357
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,397
- Thomas.
- Yes, sir?

358
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,566
- Thomas, keep the gun on him.
- I got him.

359
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,361
Keep the gun on him, Thomas.
There's weapons here.

360
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,282
This is Christmas.
This is Christmas, my friends.

361
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,701
This is the biggest find
that I've ever seen.

362
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,120
Control, come in.
This is Wikus van de Merwe

363
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,498
requesting First Reaction Battalion

364
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:22,001
<i>at Foxtrot. Yankee-5.3.0.</i>

365
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,505
<i>- I'll send them out to you now, sir.</i>
- Stand by, guys.

366
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,048
<i>ETA five minutes, over.</i>

367
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,593
This I've never seen. Have you seen this?
Amazing. Look at this gun.

368
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,012
- Fuck, man.
- What gun is this?

369
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,515
- This is absolutely amazing.
- Just hold it still.

370
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,101
- What are you doing?
- I wanna show this to Thomas.

371
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,895
- You said we can't handle them.
- I'm just gonna show it.

372
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,679
I'm not gonna use it.
It doesn't even work with humans.

373
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:48,654
- Thomas, look at this gun.
- Yeah. That's a big one, man.

374
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,698
You're a dealer, eh?

375
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,160
You hear this? You see what's happening?

376
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,830
First Battalion, my friend,
you know what that means?

377
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,624
That means your days
of flaunting the law are over.

378
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,086
Have a look there. You see that?
What's that? That's a hiding for you.

379
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,671
That's a hiding.

380
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,424
- Hey. Hey.
- Stop that!

381
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,510
- Stand back!
- Hey.

382
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,143
Wikus!

383
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,366
Come here!

384
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,036
- Wikus, are you all right?
- Come here.

385
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,289
Where do you think you're going?
Hey. Come on.

386
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,624
- Are you okay?
- Fuck off!

387
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:46,002
You don't run away from a chopper.
Where are you going?

388
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,296
You wanna piss me off?

389
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,259
Skeet off, brother. Skeet off.

390
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,515
Koobus to base, come in.

391
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,684
I've got two people down.

392
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,229
MNU guard, MNU agent.

393
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,108
It's Foxtrot-Yankee-5-3-0, copy?

394
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,110
And we need a medevac ASAP.

395
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,822
No, that's fine, Koobus.
I don't need the medevac.

396
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:18,451
- Wikus, you burned your arm.
- I'll just treat it here, Koobus.

397
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,704
It's not serious. I'll treat it here.

398
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,581
I think you must go to a doctor,
a hospital.

399
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,957
- No.
- Get it checked out.

400
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:29,629
I'll just have it treated by the medics.
Just help me... Help me up quick.

401
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,757
Did you see how fast that one was, Trent?

402
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,217
Yeah, he was fast.

403
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,636
Hell, this guy was fast, I promise you.

404
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,676
- Are you okay?
- Just a bit hot. Are you hot?

405
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,177
- Are you hot, Trent?
- Yeah.

406
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,597
Yeah. If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the kitchen.

407
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,683
That's what I... That's what I say.

408
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,144
- They are too dangerous. I understand.
- You see.

409
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,147
Another kid. There's just kids everywhere.
Kids everywhere.

410
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,024
This is what I mean.
This is why we get rid of them.

411
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,068
- The little ones.
- That's why we abort.

412
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,113
- Should I shoot the little bastard?
- You can't shoot it now.

413
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,448
It's illegal to do that.

414
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,575
- MNU agent, come out!
- Hello.

415
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,369
Hello, little guy. MNU.
Here's a sweetie for you, okay?

416
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,788
There you go. Eat your sweetie.

417
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,291
Yeah, he's gonna eat his sweetie.

418
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,710
Works like a charm every time, you know.

419
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,545
- Hey. Hey, come on! Hey!
- Fuck, man.

420
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:56,299
You almost poked my eye out
with a fucking lollipop.

421
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,509
- I tried to be fucking nice to you!
- Hey.

422
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:02,514
Fuck.
Is this your fucking little runt here?

423
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,976
You teach him some manners.
Thomas, get him out.

424
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:12,107
Come. Get down!
Had enough of you stupid things.

425
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,943
We're from MNU.

426
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,906
We require your scrawl
on this eviction notification.

427
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,242
Yes, it's eviction notice.

428
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,162
Put your scrawl on the bottom.
There's your name?

429
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:30,250
Christopher Johnson.
Put your name at the bottom.

430
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,378
You're going to another place.
A city built for prawns.

431
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,299
And we're not even going
to charge you. Okay?

432
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,093
Sign the fucking paper.

433
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,596
You don't have a choice.
You have to sign the document.

434
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,974
This guy's obviously...
He's a little sharper.

435
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,936
You know? So we're gonna have
to try something.

436
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,437
Hello.

437
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:55,191
Okay, seems like we didn't understand
each other there properly, eh?

438
00:28:55,275 --> 00:29:00,404
Okay. So you've got a little one, eh?
Do you have a license for that?

439
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:04,492
You see this litter out here? This is
dangerous conditions for your child.

440
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,621
Article 75 says that because your child
is living in dangerous conditions,

441
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:12,458
I'm gonna take him to Child Services.
I'll have a chat with your son.

442
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,126
Hey! Hey! Hey!

443
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,796
Don't threat... Don't point
your fucking tentacles at me.

444
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,923
Don't point your fucking tentacles at me.

445
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,802
You want to stay, your boy is coming
down with me to Child Services.

446
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,888
He's gonna spend the rest of his life
in a 1-by-1 meter box.

447
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,516
- Keep the gun on him, Thomas.
- Hello, little guy.

448
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,602
It's the sweetie man coming.

449
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:35,231
Fuck. Look at this, Trent. Fuck.

450
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,526
Thomas. Thomas, keep the gun on him,
he's definitely a criminal.

451
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,403
He's got a whole computer shop here.

452
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,154
He's going nowhere, boss.

453
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,282
You know, this is amazing. I mean, this...

454
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,159
These are obviously, you can see,
stolen computers now

455
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,203
that he's decorating his place with.

456
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,373
Definitely doesn't have a permit for this.

457
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,210
Where is that fucking little runt?

458
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,797
Hello, it's the sweetie man.

459
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,549
Here's a sweetie...

460
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,885
Hey, I've got a s...

461
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,347
- Hey. Wikus.
- Trent, turn it off.

462
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,767
- Turn off the fucking camera, man.
- Wikus, are you okay, boss?

463
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,853
- Are you all right?
- Fuck off. Fuck off!

464
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,522
Shit.

465
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,804
- I said...
- All right, I'll switch it off.

466
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,617
- Shall I leave him?
- Just leave him here.

467
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,076
You're lucky.

468
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,329
We'll come back for you tomorrow,
my friend.

469
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,832
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow,
Christopher Johnson.

470

<i>When dealing with aliens,
try to be polite but firm.</i>

471
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,505
<i>- A smile is cheaper than a bullet.</i>
- Are you feeling better?

472
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,549
- What?
- How are you feeling?

473
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,637
I'm... I'm fine. I'm all right.
I'm just... I'm a bit dizzy.

474
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,851
Actually, just pull up there on the side.
I just wanna get something to eat here.

475
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:03,527
Are you sure you should be having that
after your whole puking episode?

476
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,112
I actually feel a lot better.

477
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,115
- I think I needed to cleanse.
- Boss.

478
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,742
Boss.

479
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,994
- Boss. Your...
- Wikus, that's... That's...

480
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:15,123
Black stuff coming out of your nose there.

<i>Telephone call for Mr. Clark on Line 5.</i>

482
00:32:56,224 --> 00:33:00,644
Certain factions of Nigerian gangs want
to extract weaponry from District 9

483
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,231
and have been trying to for years.

484
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,861
One hundred.

485
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:10,738
All right, boys!

486
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:21,624
And they amassed thousands of these
weapons without the ability to use them.

487
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:37,431
"Muti" is a South African word.

488
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:41,769
<i>Today, it's synonymous
with witch. Doctory and magic.</i>

489
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,409
<i>The Nigerians were consuming
alien body parts.</i>

490
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:02,373
They believed that by doing so,
they were ingesting their power

491
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,959
<i>to use alien weaponry.</i>

492
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:19,098
Just give me a fucking chance
to go in front of you, man.

493
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,109
- Oh, baby, thank God.
- Hi, baby.

494
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,944
- I need to get to the toilet.
- Why?

495
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,280
- Why are the lights off?
- What's the matter?

496
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:38,451
- I might have crapped in my pants.
- Surprise!

497
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,706
- What's this for?
- Your promotion.

498
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,875
Oh, right. Got my promotion.

499
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,252
- Oh, Dad, how's it going?
- Good to see you.

500
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,422
Mom, how's it going? That's good.
Yeah, what a surprise, man.

501
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,757
- Congrats on the promotion.
- Yeah, no, thanks.

502
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,093
Congratulations, boss.
You're gonna be great.

503
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,053
- Thanks.
- Wikus, what happened?

504
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,972
Just had a small incident.

505
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,517
I'm just gonna go to the toilet
and then I'll talk to the people, okay?

506
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,520
- I need to talk to you. Come with me.
- Okay, I just gotta...

507
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,481
- Guys, can you give us a moment?
- Sure, no problem.

508
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,400
What happened out there?

509
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,235
A small incident.

510
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:19,325
You know, an unruly prawn
and I just had to get him in my grasp.

511
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,952
Listen to me, too many aliens died
out there today.

512
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,955
UIO is all over my backside.

513
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,959
Focus! You're not going
to fuck this up for me.

514
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,505
If you can't do the job,
I'll find someone who can.

515
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,261
- Hi there.
- Hey, it's nice to see you again.

516
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,848
Now, does this mean
he's in charge of this new operation?

517
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,892
- Yes.
- That's nice, eh?

518
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,354
Wikus? Baby, are you okay?

519
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,866
Okay, let's cut some cake.

520
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,410
<i>Cut some cake.</i>

521
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,894
- He doesn't look very well.
- Are you all right?

522
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,139
Just calm down, okay?

523
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,219
Wikus.

524
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,944
<i>Dr. Smith, please come
to Room 405. Dr. Smith.</i>

525
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,701
Is it...? Is it badly infected?

526
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,661
There's a lot of suppuration.

527
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:50,040
Also, you should know on my right hand,
some fingernails were coming loose.

528
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,501
And I had a black fluid
coming out of my nose

529
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,885
and sort of a black vomit.

530
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,174
What happened to my arm?

531
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,260
- Just breathe deeply.
- What happened?

532
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,970
- This is oxygen.
- What is this?

533
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,431
Just breathe deeply. Calm down.

534
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,518
- Stay calm.
- Doctor, tell my wife.

535
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,771
Go tell my wife.

536
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:18,652
<i>Attention, all medical staff members,
evacuate Ward 11 immediately.</i>

537
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:23,782
<i>All medical staff members,
evacuate Ward 11 immediately.</i>

538
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,201
Who the fuck are you, man?

539
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,620
What the fuck is wrong with you?

540
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,207
Fuck you! Fuck you!

541
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,918
Get the fuck off me, you bitch! Fuck!

542
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,213
What are you assholes planning on doing?

543
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,965
Stop right there, madam.

544
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,885
What's going on?
What are you doing to him?

545
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,428
- Let go of me!
- All right.

546
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,431
- Let me through. Let me through!
- Good to go. Come on.

547
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,767
- Wikus!
- Madam, get your hands off me.

548
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,145
Where are you taking him?

549
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,731
We have the infected agent on board.

550
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,277
We're en route to MNU HQ
with an ETA of five minutes.

551
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,743
Unzip it. Unzip it.

552
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,244
Okay.

553
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:12,123
- You got him? You ready?
- Yeah. Got him.

554
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,962
They've decided not to use any anesthetic.

555
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,757
The reason being, with nitrous,
the subject reacts to...

556
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,218
- Blood pressure is way above normal.
- Calm down.

557
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:28,222
The arm is doing
some really interesting things.

558
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,306
Aaron, what do you think we've got here?

559
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:35,437
We would have expected it to...
The antibodies to react and maintain.

560
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,980
- Dr. Visser?
- Yes?

561
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,608
I think you should see this.

562
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,319
I found it in his jacket.

563
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,987
Do you think this is alien?

564
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,032
No. No. No.

565
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,867
No, don't.

566
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,037
Don't. No.

567
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,457
Sons of bitches leave me... Fuck.

568
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,965
Where is this?

569
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,846
What?

570
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,228
What...?
What are they doing to these prawns?

571
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,358
Pain threshold, test one, DBX-7.

572
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,028
<i>Commencing test one, DBX.7.</i>

573
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,993
Now that's a strong pain reaction.

574
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,495
That means the nerves have fused.

575
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,665
I mean, it's almost completely integrated.

576
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,626
Okay, do it.

577
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,588
- B5.
<i>- Testing AMR.B5.</i>

578
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,299
All right. Okay.

579
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,009
- Clear the range.
<i>- Range fire.</i>

580
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,137
- Now. Quickly.
<i>- Quiet, please. We are now recording.</i>

581
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,514
Swing it around.

582
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,224
- What are you doing?
- There we go.

583
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,310
What are you doing?

584
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,270
- Can you grip that?
- What is this?

585
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,064
- Put it through.
- Why are you doing that with the gun?

586
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,108
- Stand by to fire.
- Stand by.

587
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,694
- You want me to shoot that?
- Stand by.

588
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,696
- Stand back.
- I cannot use this weapon.

589
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,073
And fire!

590
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,410
<i>That's good.</i>

591
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,663
- It worked. That's satisfactory.
<i>- AMR-B5 test complete.</i>

592
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,166
Right. Thanks very much.
Load up another target.

593
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,210
- You got this?
- Do you know where my wife is?

594
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,754
Do you know if my wife knows
where I am? Sir?

595
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,841
Where's my wife?

596
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,219
- Pull. Pull.
- I won't do that.

597
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,845
No, sir, I will not pull it.

598
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,223
What did you say about your wife?

599
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:37,059
- Fuck your wife!
- No, sir. No, please, sir. I will...

600
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,561
- I will not pull.
- Have to use the prod again.

601
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,314
Fire!

602
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,527
- B7.
<i>- AMR-B7.</i>

603
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,737
- I'll pull it.
- He says he can pull it.

604
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,448
I can pull the trigger.

605
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,743
I said I would pull it.

606
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,027
- You rotten pig!
- Fire.

607
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,126
- B21.
<i>- AMR-B21.</i>

608
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,754
Move. Hurry up. Move.

609
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,881
We want him in the center, by the chain.

610
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,717
- Get this off me.
- Come on. Time. Time.

611
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,179
Hey, leave that fucking prawn, man.
I will shoot a pig.

612
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:17,516
I'll shoot... Sir. Listen.
I'll shoot a pig again for you.

613
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,769
I'll pull the trigger,
but I'm not shooting that prawn, hear me?

614
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,773
- Untie that fucking guy, man.
- B21. The human hand.

615
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,608
That's good. It worked.

616
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,903
<i>- Just untie that guy. Untie that guy, sir.</i>
- Holy shit.

617
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,532
This is... You can't use the real guy.
He didn't do anything.

618
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,910
Right. I wanna observe this one.
You prod him.

619
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,162
- Everybody standing by.
- Let him go.

620
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,372
Ready to go?

621
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,417
- Don't use a... Oh, no.
- Three, two, one.

622
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,919
- Don't, don't, don't.
- Go.

623
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,256
Amazing.

624
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,176
<i>AMR-B21 test completed.</i>

625
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,764
All right. I think that's all we need.

626
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,226
Gentlemen, you're running out of time.

627
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,896
This is the key stage
in the metamorphosis.

628
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,483
His DNA is in perfect balance
between alien and human.

629
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,820
The problem is, as the infection spreads,

630
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:15,282
the transition becomes permanent
and less active.

631
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,701
He's going to turn into one of them,
a prawn?

632
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,620
What happens to him isn't important.

633
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:23,165
What's important is that we harvest
from him what we can right now.

634
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,753
This body represents hundreds of millions,

635
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:31,173
maybe billions of dollars' worth
of biotechnology.

636
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:35,427
There are people out there,
governments, corporations,

637
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,638
who would kill for this chance.

638
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,308
- Will he survive the procedure?
- No, of course not.

639
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:45,395
We need everything.
Tissue, bone marrow, blood.

640
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:49,191
The procedure's gonna basically
strip him down to nothing.

641
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,901
What about next of kin?

642
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,738
Please, help me. Don't let them do it.

643
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,198
I'll handle that.

644
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,868
Okay. I say, let's go.

645
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,246
Good. Thank you.

646
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:17,594
I don't understand.
None of this makes any sense.

647
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,973
He just hurt his arm, Dad.

648
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,849
The doctors are trying, sweetheart.

649
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,938
They're doing their best to save him.

650
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,901
We're starting to harvest material
from the specimen.

651
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:36,238
We'll start with soft tissue first.
Cut through the chest cavity.

652
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,532
We need to get the heart out quickly.

653
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:42,494
Once the septicemia set in,
it just spread.

654
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,622
- Don't touch me with this gas!
- Calm down.

655
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,249
You know Wikus.

656
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,002
He never was very strong.

657
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,297
I'll go through the chest,
straight into the heart.

658
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,299
- That should quiet him down.
- Fuck you!

659
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,093
Can I see him?

660
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,890
Not a good idea.

661
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,356
Fucker. Fuck you!

662
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:15,444
You don't fucking come near me.
Don't fucking come near me.

663
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,662
Fuck you. You big fucking man, huh?

664
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,249
Hey. Hey. Drop the knife.

665
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:33,003
Fuck you! Drop that thing
or I'll fucking cut his eyes out.

666
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,923
Okay. All right. Okay.

667
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:40,649
- We're gonna get you, mate.
- I'll fucking kill you. I'll kill you.

668
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,690
You need to let go of him now.

669
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,236
That's okay, Tania.

670
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,614
Everything will be okay.

671
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,124
Smit.

672
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,128
When?

673
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,340
Get Koobus.

674
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,826
Hey, hey, wait, man!

675
00:45:56,253 --> 00:46:00,048
<i>Wikus van de Merwe, white male, mid-30s,</i>

676
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,092
<i>is considered highly dangerous.</i>

677
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,301
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, baby.

678
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,470
<i>- Wikus? Is that you?</i>
- It's Wikus...

679
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,181
- Mrs. Smit? Hi.
<i>- How dare you phone us.</i>

680
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,892
- What are all these people doing?
<i>- None of your business.</i>

681
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,144
I need to speak to Tania straightaway.

682
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,772
It's my house. This is my phone
that you are using.

683
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,149
- I'm fucking... What?
<i>- It's disgusting.</i>

684
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:22,320
- He tried calling me.
- Anton, it's me. It's me. Accept...

685
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,905
Accept the call.

686
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:27,242
I've been friends with you
for fucking 19 years, man!

687
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,828
Fuck off! What are you watching, man?
Fuck off!

688
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:33,039
We thought it was for the best
because he needed help.

689
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:37,627
Special medical help. And he wasn't
gonna get that as a fugitive.

690
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,463
Come on. Move, move, move.

691
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,174
Go, go, go.

692
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:48,597
<i>He became the most valuable
business artifact on Earth.</i>

693
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,976
He was the only human who had ever

694
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,731
successfully been combined
with alien genetics and remained alive.

695
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:01,860
<i>But his real value was
that he could operate alien weaponry.</i>

696
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,202
Hello.

697
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:15,165
Can I get seven schnitzel burgers
and a large sauer klopse, please?

698

Oh, you <i>bliksem.</i>

703
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,890
I have to call my manager.

704
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,893
That's totally untrue.
You are legally obliged to serve me.

705
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,978
<i>Which is causing bodily disfigurement.</i>

706
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,481
Can I buy your burger, please?
If I could just...

707
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,232
<i>- It's contagious.</i>
- Don't listen.

<i>Police warn people to stay

<i>The entire world was watching him.</i>

719
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:06,985
<i>He was on every radio station,
every image on television.</i>

720
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,863
Anything you could
find had his face on it.

721
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,573
So he had nowhere else to go.

722
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,368
<i>He ended up hiding in
the one place he knew</i>

723
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,580
<i>no one would ever come looking for him.</i>

6 rand 50 or nothing.

725
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:54,509
Hello. I'd like to buy some meat, please.

726
00:50:56,386 --> 00:51:00,557
Yes, have you got hamburger
or, you know, steak roll?

727
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,101
Does it look like a hamburger shop?

728
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,061
- Which one do you want?
- Goat, then.

729
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,023
Come on, come on, come on, man.
I don't have all day here.

730
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,859
- Is that cat food there?
- Yeah, it is.

731
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:13,403
That's cat food, eh?
I'll have some of that, guys.

732
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,613
- Is that all?
- Yeah.

733
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,052

00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,209
Oh, God, please, let it be you.

<i>- Yes, it's me.</i>

I'm so happy you called me, baby.

739
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,887
<i>- Wikus, listen to me.</i>
- Okay.

740
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:25,099
<i>I have something to say to you
and it's not gonna be easy.</i>

741
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:28,686
No, okay, look. Listen, baby,
before you say anything.

742
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:32,523
Your father is working against me, baby.
He's lying to you.

743
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:37,737
I did not have sex with one
of these fucking creatures, man.

744
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,573
I would never have
any kind of pornographic activity

745
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,534
with a fucking creature. Baby...

746
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:47,121
<i>But they said that you'd
become obsessed with them.</i>

747
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,873
<i>I can't do this.</i>

748
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,834
Baby, please,
don't give up on me, you know?

749
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:57,298
Don't give up on me because I can... I...
I wanna see you again, baby.

750
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:01,052
And I'm gonna fix my arm,
and I'm gonna see you again,

751
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,846
and I'm gonna kiss you,
and I'm gonna hold you again.

752
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,309
<i>I don't want you to hold me again.</i>

753
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,730
Baby?

754
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,859
Baby?

755
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:33,043
Hey, hey. What the...?
Hey, hey. Hey, man. Hey.

756
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,231
Okay.

757
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:21,883
<i>Directly to the left of us.</i>

758
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,817
<i>Roger that. I'll send you
a couple choppers back up and...</i>

759
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,585
Copy, Control. No sign of the target.
Moving to Sector 6.

760
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,173
Okay, please, I need your help. Okay?

761
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,802
Okay. We gonna play hide-and-seek.

762
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,804
You wanna help me hide?

763
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:10,348
Show me your favorite hiding place.

764
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,437
No. Please, you don't... I need to hide.

765
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:20,191
Okay? They're coming.
They wanna kill me. All right?

766
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:24,446
I just need to hide here, sir,
for five minutes. Okay? I just need to...

767
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:39,461
What is this <i>kak?</i>
What are you doing here? I remember you.

768
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:45,133
Please, sir, you have to help me. I'm
losing blood. They're trying to kill me.

769
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,964
Where the fuck I am?

770
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,676
Please.

771
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,710
I don't know what you're talking about.

772
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,189
Right, right.

773
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:47,237
Was it a black fluid in a glass container?

774
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,365
Right. I confiscated it,
and the guys at the lab took it.

775
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,618
It'll be at MNU. MNU has it.

776
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,581
Okay. Okay.

777
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,006
What is this?

778
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,342
Where is this?

779
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:14,723
Is that your shack?

780
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,185
This whole thing's under your shack?

781
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:23,481
For 20 years you've had this fucking thing
hidden down here. This is...

782
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,275
This is very illegal.

783
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:31,823
I mean, this is a fine, you know,
if they... If they catch you with this.

784
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:48,172
What is he saying about the fuel?
Are you trying to start this thing?

785
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:52,135
Are you little fuckers trying
to start this and get away, eh?

786
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,222
Yeah, you sneaky fucking prawns, eh?

787
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:04,063
What? What did you say about the fixing?

788
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,398
What, you could fix me?

789
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:13,364
No. No. Listen, listen. Are you
saying that you could turn this...?

790
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:17,035
This prawn hand into a human hand?
You can make me human again?

791
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,296
That's fantastic!
You guys are brilliant, eh?

792
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,631
I always thought
the prawns were intelligent.

793
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,384
Let's do it.

794
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,642
Right. Right. Okay.

795
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:45,146
All right, I'll tell you what,
why don't we go...?

796
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,524
Let's get some more.
Let's go collect some up.

797
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,114
Fuck, man. Fuck!

798
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:58,451
Fuck!
The only one is the one I confiscated?

799
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,288
It's four stories underground.

800
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,529
Why's he keep looking at me like that?

801
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:18,679
Fuck off, man. I'm not the same.

802
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,015
Not the fucking same.

803
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:39,617
And what then? Then we both die, eh?
Both of us dead.

804
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:44,122
That's a suicide mission. Can you not fill
my head with that sort of nonsense?

805
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:57,886
Oh, Christ.

806
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,206
Fuck. Okay.

807
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:47,560
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

808
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,420
- Hello?
<i>- Wikus?</i>

809
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:18,048
- Tania? Baby.
<i>- Are you okay?</i>

810
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,134
Oh, God. Thank God.

811
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,303
<i>Where are you?</i>

812
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,143
<i>All those things my father said...</i>

813
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,813
<i>I know he was trying to protect me.</i>

814
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,108
<i>I just don't know what to believe anymore.</i>

815
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:39,320
Baby, baby, I know,
but listen to me. It's all lies.

816
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,824
I swear to you.
Everything he said to you is lies.

817
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:44,992
<i>I know.</i>

818
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,245
What? What?

819
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:51,499
<i>I believe you, Wikus.
I just want you back.</i>

820
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:54,126
<i>I want everything back the way it was.</i>

821
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:58,881
That's... Baby, that's what I want.
That's what... That's great.

822
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:03,261
That's great news. I can make it
the way it was, if you take me back.

823
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:08,558
<i>But how? How can we go back?</i>

824
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:15,481
I have a plan,
and I know how to fix it. All right?

825
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:20,569
I know how to fix myself. And it'll be me
and we'll be back together.

826
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,446
<i>You promise me?</i>

827
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,532
I promise you, baby.

828
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,743
Don't give up on me, okay?

829
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:31,288
Because I haven't given up on you,
all right?

830
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,457
<i>I won't.</i>

831
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,292
<i>I love you.</i>

832
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,795
<i>I love you too.</i>

833
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:40,924
- Tell me you got a fix on him.
- D-9.

834
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:47,781
Hi. You don't wanna go to the tents.
They're not better.

835
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,825
They're smaller than the shacks.

836
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,411
Actually more like a concentration camp.

837
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:57,667
If I can get you that black fluid,
what happens then?

838
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,130
And you can start that thing?

839
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:09,095
Okay. So just to be clear,
this is gonna go back...

840
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:14,808
This is gonna go back
to be human like this.

841
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:16,352
I can go home.

842
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:19,480
And then, you can go home.
You can take your boy.

843
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:22,859
You can take all the prawns.
If I could get you that fluid, right?

844
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:38,332
Look. Look, Christopher.

845
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,835
I know where we can get weapons.

846
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:52,221
Hi, guys. Hello. Hi, hi. Hello.

847
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:57,435
- I'd like to buy some weapons, please.
- No, no, no. Hold it.

848
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,534
I need to buy weapons, please.

849
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:18,789
You and I both know that
there are illegal weapons inside there.

850
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:23,044
I have money and I would like to buy
some of those wea... Okay.

851
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,839
Okay. Okay. Okay.

852
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,344
- I brought you here to make me money.
- Sit. Don't move around.

853
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,806
You're fucking wasting my time.

854
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:39,644
Shut up. Fucking lying bitch.

855
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:50,530
Thank... Thank you, sir, for your time.
Thank you very much for seeing me.

856
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,866
I would like to buy some weapons.

857
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:59,413
AK-47, some grenades,
maybe tear-gas canisters.

858
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,582
I see you have limpet mines here as well.

859
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:06,336
And I also see you guys have
alien weapons there, which is great.

860
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,089
I could have one or two of those.

861
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:11,884
I have money, okay?

862
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,970
Now, I'm...

863
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,082
Sir. Please, sir.
Please, sir. Please, sir.

864
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:34,073
Shit.

865
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:40,538
No, no, no. No, don't, please.

866
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,712
Why are you doing that? Why is he...?
What is he...? What do you want?

867
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,172
- What do you...?
- Shut up.

868
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,007
Please.

869
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,217
Sir, don't.

870
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:55,886
Forget the weapons. Forget the weapons.

871
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,430
Forget the weapons.

872
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,809
What's he saying?
What does he want? What did he say?

873
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:04,604
What does he want? What does he...?

874
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,615
I'll show you. I'm gonna teach you.

875
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:17,783
Hey, hey, hey.

876
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:20,828
Holy shit.

877
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,377
You tell them to stand down!

878
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,467
You tell them to be quiet.

879
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,221
You, back off. Put your gun down.

880
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,557
Tell them to put the weapons
in the bag, man.

881
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:45,144
Fuck. Give me the fucking weapons, man.

882
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:47,887
Don't you fucking look at me.

883
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:53,319
I said, don't fucking look at me.

884
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:03,120
Fucking hurry up, man!

885
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:21,513
Drop the fucking knife.

886
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:24,934
- Drop your fucking knife!
- Easy, easy.

887
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:34,234
And no live ammo. He's useless to us dead.

888
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:35,986
Would you relax?

889
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:39,948
For fuck's sakes. My men have done this
a hundred times before.

890
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:43,911
Maintaining a visual on that location
at November-Alpha-1 -9-1-1.

891
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,998
- The unit is closing in now, sir.
<i>- It's gonna be quick.</i>

892
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,959
<i>It's gonna be clean.</i>

893
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:54,505
And best of all, it's gonna be quiet.

894
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,718
Van de Merwe hasn't got a clue
what's coming his way.

895
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:03,764
It's empty.

896
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,141
Where are they?

897
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,602
The target is gone. The place is empty.

898
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:11,855
<i>What do you mean, "empty"?
Where the fuck is he?</i>

899
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:15,234
That little shithead has got no idea
what's coming his way.

900
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:16,777
I'm gonna find him.

901
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,701
<i>Security breach, Level 2.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

902
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:26,495
<i>Do not use...</i>

903
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,979
There are the guards. At the gate.
Watch the guards at the gate, man.

904
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,043
Come on.

905
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,214
<i>Security breach, Level 2.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

906
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,925
Move. Get out. Get out!

907
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,180
- Don't shoot!
- Go.

908
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:47,891
Going down. Four stories down.

909
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,394
This is alien weaponry.
Give me a status report.

910
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:52,354
<i>Security breach, Level 4. Bio lab.</i>

911
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:55,649
- It's van de Merwe. He's on Level 4.
- Switch to live ammo.

912
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,318
- We're taking him out.
- Colonel.

913
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:00,487
We were ordered not
to use live ammunition.

914
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:03,021
- They want him alive.
<i>- Security breach, Level 4.</i>

915
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:09,163
Okay. Stay here until I call you.

916
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,124
I need to get the door open.

917
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,418
<i>Possible alien tissue detected.</i>

918
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,211
I said, stay until I call you.

919
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:19,298
<i>Wait for the decontamination process
to finish before..</i>

920
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,384
You trying to get yourself killed?

921
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:30,393
He shot at me.

922
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:36,064
Open up! Get the fuck out!
Don't fucking look at me. Get out!

923
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,608
Get the fuck out!

924
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:44,657
Okay.

925
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:54,708
- Move, move, move.
- Get out! Everybody get the fuck out!

926
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:58,003
Get out! Go! Move out of here now!

927
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:01,048
I'll send you home in a fucking jar. Go!

928
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,136
Don't worry about that.

929
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,722
It's in one of these.

930
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,225
Check these. Check these boxes.

931
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:16,271
Any kind of a box that looks
like it can hold a tube. Just check that.

932
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,190
These fuckers.

933
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,654
Go, go, go.

934
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:27,450
Clear.

935
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,666
<i>- Security breach...</i>
- I got it! I got it.

936
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:42,381
Chris, I got it. Let's go. Let's go.

937
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:44,800
Christopher!

938
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:49,513
Oh, fuck.

939
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:54,935
Listen. Listen, I didn't... I promise you,
I didn't know they were doing this.

940
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:57,604
Until they brought me here
the other day, I swear to you,

941
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,315
I did not know they were doing this,
but...

942
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,568
Christopher. Christopher, listen,
look at me. Listen to me.

943
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:06,446
We need to leave now. Okay?

944
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,949
The whole of MNU is gonna come down here.

945
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,784
He's going to destroy us.

946
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:15,080
We are big but quick. We can do this.

947
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,714
- Okay, we're gonna get out of here.
- Target. Fire!

948
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:20,794
Move, move, move.

949
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,633
Move down the row in formation. Move!

950
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,974
- Fuck!
- Move close.

951
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,308
You fucking bastard!

952
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:38,478
- Christopher, what are you doing?!
- Two o'clock.

953
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:39,813
Cover the sides!

954
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:44,610
The bugs, the bugs, the bugs!

955
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:48,906
Think of your boy, for fuck's sake!

956
01:12:57,831 --> 01:13:00,625
What are you doing?!
Are you out of your fucking mind?!

957
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,044
Move, move!

958
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:04,922
You'll get us killed.

959
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,968
Fuck, yeah, man. Come on.

960
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,679
It's a fucking dead end!

961
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:17,389
I didn't say anything about a way out.
I promised you we'd get in. We're in.

962
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:21,146
What? Where are you going?

963
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,898
Follow you?

964
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:27,685
What are you doing?

965
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:30,989
I've got you, Wikus!

966
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,200
It's a dead end!

967
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:46,589
Come on. Get in!

968
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,344
Okay.

969
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,223
Okay, hold on.

970
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:09,611
<i>Reports are coming in of an explosion
in downtown Johannesburg.</i>

971
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:13,657
Well, there was a terrorist attack,
but I can assure you we've dealt with it.

972
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:21,790
Drop it now. We drop it now. The cunt!

973
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,050
They're really pissed at us now.

974
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:36,472
Shit.

975
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:44,063
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

976
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:48,067
Don't drop that fucking thing.

977
01:14:57,242 --> 01:14:59,662
Come on, come on, come on. Move!
Get down there.

978
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,003
Set it down right now!

979
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:11,037
When we get to the mother ship,
how long is this gonna take?

980
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:13,801
The fixing. To fix me.

981
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:19,264
Okay. All right. That's fine.
How long do you need?

982
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,643
Sorry, wait. Just go slowly
with the clicks there.

983
01:15:23,727 --> 01:15:27,981
It sounded like you said "three years."
Like human years.

984
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:33,237
What? Three fucking years?!

985
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:43,455
The deal was, you go home, I get fixed.

986
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:50,170
I'm a fucking medical experiment!
You hear me?

987
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:53,090
I'm a fucking medical experiment, man.

988
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:04,142
I'll just stay here, Christopher.
I'll just stay here in this shack.

989
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,687
And I'll see you in three years' time, eh?

990
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:09,648
Hey, Christopher.

991
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:26,999
Arriving on the ground. First Reaction
Battalion is in pursuit. Over.

992
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,131
Where the fuck is he?!

993
01:16:35,215 --> 01:16:36,883
Hey.

994
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:39,511
You got Wikus down there, my boy?

995
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:42,263
Tell me!

996
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:46,559
No. Your daddy needs to stay there
to sort out a few things, all right?

997
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:50,564
But we're gonna go and come back
and fetch him. Okay? All right?

998
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:55,944
In here?

999
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,821
It goes in here, eh?

1000
01:16:57,905 --> 01:17:00,532
How the fuck do you open this, prawn?

1001
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:05,912
Hey?

1002
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:08,748
Tell me, you fucker.
You want me to fucking kill you?

1003
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:13,045
Hey? Is that what you fucking want? Hey?

1004
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:18,801
Hey?

1005
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:24,848
- Okay. Let's see.
- Do you understand me?

1006
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:28,935
What?

1007
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:31,938
What? Okay. There's no buttons.

1008
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:33,565
- On.
- Open it!

1009
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:37,277
- Activate.
- You have five seconds to tell me.

1010
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:40,739
One prawn, one bullet.

1011
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:49,289
I can't believe I get paid to do this.

1012
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:54,002
I love watching you prawns die.

1013
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:58,131
What the fuck, man?

1014
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:01,009
Oh, fuck.

1015
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:07,099
All right. Okay. Okay.

1016
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:15,274
Get out! Now!

1017
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,824
<i>This is remarkable.</i>

1018
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:27,577
<i>It looks like something is emerging
from the ground.</i>

1019
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:30,079
<i>Something is definitely coming
out of the ground.</i>

1020
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:33,041
All right. All right. Okay. Okay, steady.

1021
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:37,296
Fuck it!

1022
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,761
Go sit down. You can't play here now.
Your Uncle Wikus is flying.

1023
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,930
Uncle Wikus is flying now, all right?

1024
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:49,433
Fuck. Fuck off!

1025
01:18:56,773 --> 01:18:59,651
- Hold your track on that target.
<i>- Affirmative, colonel.</i>

1026
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,612
Fire when locked.

1027
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:08,076
<i>It seems to be drifting
towards the center of the territory.</i>

1028
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,828
<i>- We have a lock.</i>
- Fire!

1029
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:14,666
<i>Something has fired upon it.
Yes, it's been hit.</i>

1030
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,751
What the fuck is that?!

1031
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:20,547
<i>One of the engines is billowing smoke.
It's out of control.</i>

1032
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:24,843
It's going down, boss.
Should I send the boys to fuck him up?

1033
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:31,766
<i>- -Now, and.. And it's hit the ground.
- A massive impact.</i>

1034
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,727
<i>And it's come to a standstill.</i>

1035
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:44,237
Shut the fuck up!

1036
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,323
Get this fuck inside.
We're moving out. Come, let's go!

1037
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:51,119
- Move him out. That's it.
- Move!

1038
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,248
<i>We're banking around,
trying to get a better view of the ship,</i>

1039
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:57,125
<i>which is absolutely wrecked.</i>

1040
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,711
<i>Waiting for some of the smoke to clear.</i>

1041
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,484
<i>Somebody has been
pulled out of the vehicle.</i>

1042
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:06,319
<i>It looks like a human being.</i>

1043
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:09,322
<i>We are getting unconfirmed reports
that this might be</i>

1044
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:12,408
<i>Wikus van de Merwe,
a fugitive that has been on the run</i>

1045
01:21:12,492 --> 01:21:14,911
<i>from Multi-National United
for the past week.</i>

1046
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:19,666
<i>They're loading him into a vehicle now
and heading off.</i>

1047
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:28,466
<i>Battalion One to Control, confirming
prisoners are secured and traveling.</i>

1048
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,428
<i>Expect delivery by 1600 hours.</i>

1049
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:47,152
What the fuck?!

1050
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:50,655
Back up.

1051
01:21:57,204 --> 01:21:58,830
Watch out. Watch out!

1052
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,085
We found him, boss.

1053
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:16,598
Get up. Move! Move!

1054
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:24,314
- Take cover. Fall back.
- We need to regroup.

1055
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:26,733
What the fuck?

1056
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,699
Control, we're taking enemy fire.

1057
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:37,452
We need support. Backup. Backup now!

1058
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,001
Fuck off! No, fuck off, man!

1059
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,722
Get your hands off me. Fucking get off me!

1060
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:05,480
Get your fucking hands off me!
I'll fucking kill you.

1061
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,736
Fuck you.

1062
01:24:00,785 --> 01:24:05,290
Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck you!

1063
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:15,550
Go, go, go.

1064
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:19,721
<i>Arriving at location. Over.</i>

1065
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:30,982
- Additional troops are moving into place.
- Go, go, go.

1066
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:38,239
Move it.

1067
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:40,909
- Koobus!
- Cover the eastern block.

1068
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,924
No, no, no. It won't work.

1069
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,053
- Go, go, go.
- Move it.

1070
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,984
<i>With MNU security forces,
this armed faction is..</i>

1071
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,861
It won't work.

1072
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:10,081
Let's cut here.

1073
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:28,641
Fuck!

1074
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:38,068
Fuck.

1075
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:49,662
<i>We're getting reports of alien devices
activating throughout the city.</i>

1076
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:53,917
<i>That alien technology is starting
to work again after 20 years.</i>

1077
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:50,473
- Pienaar?
- Yeah.

1078
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:53,684
- See that prawn in the Casspir?
- Yeah.

1079
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:56,187
He knows what the
fuck is up with that ship.

1080
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:59,065
Get the fucker out
and get him talking now.

1081
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,486
- Kronier.
- Cover.

1082
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:16,791
<i>Contractors are closing in
on the Nigerian compound, and it...</i>

1083
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:21,838
Over here, cunt. Come outside,
you fucking alien. Come here.

1084
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:34,809
What's your plan, huh? What's your plan?

1085
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:39,856
Move, move, move.

1086
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:59,209
How are you doing that?

1087
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,420
Who's moving that ship?

1088
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,424
All right. That's very comfort...

1089
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:09,844
Fucking <i>bliksem.</i>

1090
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:15,934
Wait for my command.
Make sure you fucking shoot to kill.

1091
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,774
- Fall back!
- What the fuck?

1092
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,652
Move it, move it!

1093
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:30,114
Take the right flanks.
Take that fucker down.

1094
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:39,915
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire and keep your positions.

1095
01:29:39,999 --> 01:29:41,960
It's van de Merwe.

1096
01:29:43,086 --> 01:29:45,171
Hey, Dickus!

1097
01:30:00,019 --> 01:30:03,397
You may have the prawn. Okay?
Just let me fucking go.

1098
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:05,399
- Run, Wikus!
- You let me go.

1099
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:07,359
- Run!
- You let me go!

1100
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:12,531
And keep on running,
you fucking coward. Run! Run!

1101
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:14,241
<i>Control. This is Control.</i>

1102
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:18,329
Get the air support up
and get on his fucking tail now!

1103
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:21,207
<i>Copy that. Air support is
dispatching now. Over.</i>

1104
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:23,417
It's not gonna work, boss.

1105
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:26,462
He's a tough one. He's not gonna talk.

1106
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,590
Then just fucking kill him.

1107
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:45,981
<i>- He's not gonna talk.
- Then just fucking kill him.</i>

1108
01:30:46,065 --> 01:30:47,191
Fuck.

1109
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:51,487
<i>- He's a tough one. He's not gonna talk.
- Then just fucking kill him.</i>

1110
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:16,679
Hey. Come on.

1111
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:19,513
I'll get you out of here.
I'll get you to the drop ship.

1112
01:31:20,933 --> 01:31:22,935
It's not too fucking far! Get up.

1113
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:25,938
I'm gonna get you there.
I'm gonna get you to your boy.

1114
01:31:26,022 --> 01:31:28,900
Come on. Stay behind me. Stay behind me.

1115
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:41,662
Retreat! Fall back! Fall back!

1116
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:43,873
Fall back, fall back, fall back.

1117
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:48,211
Come on, run, run, run! Go.

1118
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:54,258
Arriving at location now.

1119
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:56,343
We have clearance to engage.

1120
01:31:56,427 --> 01:31:59,222
It's coming towards us.
Get down, get down.

1121
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:05,603
- Take up positions to the east!
- Go, guys. Go. Move.

1122
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:13,277
JJ, go for point three. Okay, go, go, go!

1123
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:19,367
He's heading for the drop ship.
Cut those fuckers off!

1124
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:28,835
What the fuck?

1125
01:32:35,174 --> 01:32:37,093
- Shit.
- You fuck!

1126
01:32:39,762 --> 01:32:42,973
No, we can make it.
I think the ship's stopping.

1127
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:45,059
We can make it. Come on.

1128
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:54,193
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1129
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:05,204
Listen, you go ahead. You can make it.

1130
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:09,667
I'm gonna just hold him off here
and I'll join you soon.

1131
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:16,965
Take your boy and go home.
You have to make it.

1132
01:33:17,049 --> 01:33:19,899
Don't make me go through this
and not make it. Understand?

1133
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:25,933
Go! Go now before I change my mind, man.

1134
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:26,851
Go!

1135
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:56,923
Fuck! I'm not fucking scared of you!

1136
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:06,265
Big fucking men.

1137
01:34:26,536 --> 01:34:28,037
Come on! Bring what you got!

1138
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:30,581
Come on!

1139
01:34:53,271 --> 01:34:55,106
You want me? You want me?

1140
01:35:00,444 --> 01:35:01,654
Is that all you've got?

1141
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:06,117
Is that all you've fucking got?

1142
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:12,706
<i>Some sort of quite extraordinary light
from the mother ship.</i>

1143
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:15,626
<i>I've never seen anything like it.
It's a beam of..</i>

1144
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:24,176
Select weapons. Okay, fuck. Which one?

1145
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,971
No, not that one. Go forward.
Forward scan. Okay.

1146
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:31,726
Fire.

1147
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:02,965
<i>Report. Come in.</i>

1148
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:04,883
Get to the vehicle now. Get going.

1149
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:06,427
- Yes, colonel.
- Go, go, go!

1150
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:17,229
Fuck.

1151
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:33,871
Fuck. Fuck.

1152
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:36,332
You wanna fucking play with me, Koobus?

1153
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:39,543
You fucker!

1154
01:36:57,853 --> 01:36:59,438
He almost got him.

1155
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:03,609
Go. Come on.

1156
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:12,404
Unbelievable.

1157
01:39:13,572 --> 01:39:16,242
Now I know why everybody wants
a piece of you.

1158
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:22,498
I can't wait for those med boys
to cut you up.

1159
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:28,378
But you know what? You're not gonna waste
any more of my time.

1160
01:39:28,462 --> 01:39:31,507
You half-breed piece of shit.

1161
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:36,262
I'm gonna just fucking kill you myself.

1162
01:39:44,603 --> 01:39:45,938
Stay back, you fucker.

1163
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:48,190
Stay back.

1164
01:39:49,942 --> 01:39:51,944
Stay back!

1165
01:41:17,571 --> 01:41:20,407
<i>And people everywhere across Johannesburg</i>

1166
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:24,077
<i>are flooding the streets,
are pouring out of their offices.</i>

1167
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:28,331
<i>And all eyes are pointing up
towards the sky on this momentous day.</i>

1168
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:32,794
<i>It's the first time, ladies and gentlemen,
in over two decades</i>

1169
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:35,422
<i>that the mother ship has shown
any movement,</i>

1170
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:37,465
<i>and people are tremendously excited.</i>

1171
01:41:37,549 --> 01:41:40,719
<i>The city has come to
an absolute standstill.</i>

1172
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:45,390
<i>And everybody wants to know
what's going to happen next.</i>

1173
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:48,727
<i>There's no way of knowing
whether Christopher Johnson will return.</i>

1174
01:41:48,811 --> 01:41:53,649
We don't know if he was escaping,
whether he will effect a rescue plan...

1175
01:41:55,901 --> 01:41:58,153
and as the so-called free press says,

1176
01:41:58,237 --> 01:42:00,837
whether or not he'll come back
and declare war on us.

1177
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:31,019
<i>This is the last known footage
of Wikus van de Merwe.</i>

1178
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:36,107
<i>And we can only speculate
as to what has happened to him.</i>

1179
01:42:36,191 --> 01:42:40,403
The more zany conspiracy
theories state that

1180
01:42:40,487 --> 01:42:44,908
he's been captured by MNU
or by another government.

1181
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:50,330
Or by perhaps some shady government agency
and is actually being held in captivity.

1182
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:52,791
If we knew where he was,
we would help him.

1183
01:42:52,875 --> 01:42:56,586
And that is the most difficult part,
just not knowing where he is.

1184
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:58,630
Wikus, sadly, is gone,

1185
01:42:58,714 --> 01:43:03,635
but I'm the one who stays behind
with all the questions.

1186
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:05,720
I can't give the answers.

1187
01:43:05,804 --> 01:43:09,015
He died in my mind a long time ago.

1188
01:43:09,099 --> 01:43:10,308
And that's that.

1189
01:43:10,392 --> 01:43:14,145
Wikus van de Merwe is a name
that will become very widely known

1190
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:18,108
because of this pivotal role
that he played in this whole event.

1191
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:21,403
<i>He was an honest man
and he didn't deserve what happened.</i>

1192
01:43:21,487 --> 01:43:25,323
<i>I know. I looked into the computer system
and I found stuff.</i>

1193
01:43:25,407 --> 01:43:28,910
I mean, the whole data was there,
you know?

1194
01:43:28,994 --> 01:43:31,372
They didn't even do
a good job of hiding it.

1195
01:43:49,723 --> 01:43:52,810
You guys haven't seen my wife.
Let me show you my wife.

1196
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:55,562
She's my special angel.

1197
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:58,857
She even looks like a angel with a halo.
You want to see?

1198
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:03,403
With the white veil over the head,
she even looks like an angel.

1199
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:07,490
Everyone says his wife's an angel, but
this is a real angel that you're seeing.

1200
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:10,724
On the cameras. They won't put that
in the video, I don't think.

1201
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:22,631
I found this at my front door,
as though somebody had just left it there.

1202
01:44:24,341 --> 01:44:28,345
My friends say I should throw it away
because it's just a piece of rubbish.

1203
01:44:30,013 --> 01:44:32,933
And it couldn't possibly come from him.

1204
01:44:34,017 --> 01:44:36,186
I know it's true.
