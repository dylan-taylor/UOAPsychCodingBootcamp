1
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,093
Fuck.

2
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:57,260
How long until we get to his estate?

3
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:03,182
We've been flying over his estate
for the past two hours.

4
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,420
You're leaving me here?

5
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:35,840
This is as close as I'm allowed
to get to the building.

6
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:37,633
What building?

7
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:39,385
Follow the river.

8
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:41,345
Got it.

9
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:43,514
Keep your head down
and get clear of the rotors.

10
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:44,682
Okay.

11
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:44,575
Caleb Smith.

12
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:46,869
Yes.

13
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,664
Please approach the console
and face the screen.

14
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,971
Take your keycard.

15
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,642
You may now enter the residence.

16
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:49,515
Hello?

17
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:04,864
Hello?

18
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:51,035
Caleb Smith.

19
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:52,745
Hey.

20
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:55,831
Dude!

21
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,085
I've been so looking forward
to this week with you.

22
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:00,419
Come in. Come on in.

23
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:01,504
Thanks.

24
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:05,257
You want something to eat or drink
after your journey?

25
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,659
- No. No, thanks, I'm fine.
- Sure?

26
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:07,802
Yeah.

27
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:10,262
To be honest, I thought we'd have

28
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:12,431
breakfast together, but...

29
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:14,576
I can't really eat anything.

30
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,703
- I got the mother of all fucking hangovers.
- Oh, yeah?

31
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,729
Oh, my God, like you wouldn't even believe.

32
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:20,523
When I have a heavy night,

33
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:25,444
I compensate the next morning.
Exercise. Anti-oxidants. You know?

34
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:26,987
Yeah, sure.

35
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:33,035
Was it a good party?

36
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,788
- Party?
- Yeah. Wasn't there a party?

37
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,959
There wasn't a party.

38
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:41,043
Sorry.

39
00:06:42,086 --> 00:06:44,630
Caleb, I'm just gonna throw this out there,
so it's said, okay?

40
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:45,756
You're freaked out.

41
00:06:45,798 --> 00:06:47,591
- I am?
- Yeah. You're freaked out,

42
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:50,219
by the helicopter and the mountains
and the house,

43
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:51,679
because it's all so super-cool.

44
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:53,482
You're freaked out by me, to be meeting me,

45
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:56,267
having this conversation in this room,
at this moment. Right?

46
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:59,770
And I get that.
I get the moment you're having, but...

47
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:01,605
Dude, can we just get past that?

48
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,442
Can we just be two guys? Nathan and Caleb.

49
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:06,861
Not the whole employer-employee thing.

50
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:09,488
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah?

51
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:10,781
Yes. Yeah.

52
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:13,367
It's good to meet you, Nathan.

53
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:16,078
It's good to meet you, too, Caleb.

54
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,767
Well, I guess the first thing I
should do is explain your pass.

55
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,376
Now, it's simple enough.

56
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,503
It opens some doors
and it doesn't open others.

57
00:07:24,587 --> 00:07:26,314
And that just makes
everything easy for you, right?

58
00:07:26,338 --> 00:07:27,381
Yes.

59
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,317
Yeah, 'cause you're like,
"Fuck, I'm in someone else's house.

60
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:30,593
"Can I do this, can I do that?"

61
00:07:30,676 --> 00:07:32,720
And this card,
it just takes all that worry away.

62
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:36,015
If you try a door and it stays shut,
okay, it's off-limits.

63
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:39,351
You try another door and it opens,
then it's for you.

64
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:41,187
Let's try this one.

65
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:48,235
I guess it's for you, Caleb.

66
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:56,076
- You like?
- Yeah.

67
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,828
It's your room.

68
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,622
You got a bed here.

69
00:08:00,372 --> 00:08:02,500
A bathroom right back here.

70
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,001
Little desk.

71
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,377
Cupboards.

72
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:10,090
Little fridge.

73
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:13,135
Cozy, right?

74
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:14,595
Yeah, this is great.

75
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:16,388
- What?
- Sorry?

76
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:19,117
There's something wrong. What's wrong?

77
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:20,309
There's nothing wrong.

78
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,104
It's the windows.

79
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:26,816
You're thinking there's no windows.

80
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:28,317
It's subterranean.

81
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,402
It's not cozy, it's claustrophobic.

82
00:08:30,486 --> 00:08:32,238
No. No way. I wasn't thinking that.

83
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,907
I was thinking, "This is really cool."

84
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:39,578
Caleb, there's a reason
there are no windows in this room.

85
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:40,996
There is?

86
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,332
This building isn't a house.

87
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:45,417
It's a research facility.

88
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:48,504
Buried in these walls
is enough fiber optic cable

89
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:50,923
to reach the moon and lasso it.

90
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,426
And I want to talk to you
about what I'm researching,

91
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,928
I want to share it with you.

92
00:08:56,011 --> 00:09:00,349
In fact, I want to share it with you
so much, it's eating me up inside.

93
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,103
But there's something
I need you to do for me first.

94
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:11,360
"Blue Book non-disclosure agreement."

95
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,906
Take your time. Read it over.

96
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:21,453
"The signee agrees to regular data audit
with unlimited access,

97
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:25,207
"to confirm that no disclosure
of information has taken place

98
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,960
"in public or private forums,

99
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:29,920
"using any means of communication,

100
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:33,883
"including but not limited to that
which is disclosed orally

101
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:37,344
"or in written or electronic form."

102
00:09:40,306 --> 00:09:41,473
I think I need a lawyer.

103
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:44,643
- It's standard.
- It doesn't feel very standard.

104
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:46,729
Okay, it's not standard.

105
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:49,607
What can I tell you, Caleb?
You don't have to sign it.

106
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:53,319
You know, we can spend the next few days
just shooting pool, getting drunk together.

107
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:54,737
Bonding.

108
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,198
And when you discover
what you've missed out on, in about a year,

109
00:09:58,282 --> 00:10:01,493
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

110
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:10,169
Good call.

111
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:19,053
So,

112
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:22,473
do you know what the Turing Test is?

113
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:27,227
Yeah.

114
00:10:27,478 --> 00:10:29,480
I know what the Turing Test is.

115
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:35,861
It's when a human interacts
with a computer.

116
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:39,990
And if the human doesn't know
they're interacting with a computer,

117
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:41,158
the test is passed.

118
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,827
And what does a pass tell us?

119
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:46,956
That the computer has
artificial intelligence.

120
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,541
Are you building an Ai?

121
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,835
I've already built one.

122
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:54,380
And over the next few days,

123
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,757
you're gonna be the human component
in a Turing Test.

124
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,094
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, that's right, Caleb. You got it.

125
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,555
Because if that test is passed,

126
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:09,478
you are dead center of the greatest
scientific event in the history of man.

127
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:14,191
If you've created a conscious machine,
it's not the history of man.

128
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:16,860
That's the history of gods.

129
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:00,672
Hello.

130
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,218
Hi.

131
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,221
I'm Caleb.

132
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:10,808
Hello, Caleb.

133
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,937
Do you have a name?

134
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:16,855
Yes.

135
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:19,191
Ava.

136
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:22,736
I'm pleased to meet you, Ava.

137
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:25,697
I'm pleased to meet you, too.

138
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:29,868
I've never met anyone new before.

139
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:31,995
Only Nathan.

140
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,625
Then I guess we're both
in quite a similar position.

141
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,461
Haven't you met lots of new people before?

142
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,672
None like you.

143
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,053
So we need to break the ice.

144
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:51,140
- Do you know what I mean by that?
- Yes.

145
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:52,474
What do I mean?

146
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:55,060
Overcome initial social awkwardness.

147
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:57,104
So let's have a conversation.

148
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,231
Okay.

149
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,735
What would you like to have
a conversation about?

150
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,363
Why don't we start with you telling me
something about yourself?

151
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:09,158
What would you like to know?

152
00:14:09,241 --> 00:14:10,951
Whatever comes into your head.

153
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:14,288
Well, you already know my name.

154
00:14:15,497 --> 00:14:17,791
And you can see that I'm a machine.

155
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,502
- Would you like to know how old I am?
- Sure.

156
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:21,879
I'm one.

157
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:23,463
One what?

158
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:26,383
- One year or one day?
- One.

159
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:32,472
When did you learn how to speak, Ava?

160
00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:35,851
I always knew how to speak,

161
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:38,770
and that's strange, isn't it?

162
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:40,689
Why?

163
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:43,942
Because language is something
that people acquire.

164
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:48,572
Well, some people believe
language exists from birth.

165
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:51,325
And what is learned
is the ability to attach words

166
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,785
and structure to the latent ability.
Do you agree with that?

167
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:55,746
I don't know.

168
00:14:57,456 --> 00:14:59,958
Will you come back tomorrow, Caleb?

169
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,044
Yes.

170
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:07,674
Good.

171
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,684
Oh, man, she's fascinating.

172
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,250
When you talk to her, you're just...

173
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:23,065
Through the looking glass.

174
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,318
"Through the looking glass." Wow.

175
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:28,320
You're good with words, Caleb.
You're quotable.

176
00:15:28,403 --> 00:15:29,672
Actually, that's someone else's quote.

177
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,616
You know, I wrote down that other line
you came up with.

178
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:33,825
The one about how

179
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,702
if I've invented a machine
with consciousness,

180
00:15:35,786 --> 00:15:37,287
I'm not a man, I'm God.

181
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:38,640
I don't think that's exactly what I...

182
00:15:38,664 --> 00:15:40,832
I just thought,
"Fuck, man, that is so good."

183
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,377
When we get to tell the story. You know?

184
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,337
I turned to Caleb,

185
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,839
and he looked up at me and he said,

186
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:49,216
"You're not a man, you're God."

187
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:50,676
Yeah, but I didn't say that.

188
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:52,511
So...

189
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:53,804
Anyway.

190
00:15:56,682 --> 00:15:57,683
You're impressed.

191
00:15:58,433 --> 00:15:59,977
Yes. Yes.

192
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,646
- Although...
- Although?

193
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,403
There's a qualification
to you being impressed?

194
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,985
No, there's no qualification to her.

195
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:10,904
It's just in the Turing Test,

196
00:16:10,988 --> 00:16:12,906
the machine should be hidden
from the examiner.

197
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,574
No, no, no, we're way past that.

198
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:18,370
If I hid Ava from you, so you just heard
her voice, she would pass for human.

199
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:21,373
The real test is to show you
that she's a robot

200
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:24,209
and then see if you still feel
she has consciousness.

201
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:27,838
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

202
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:33,218
Her language abilities, they're incredible.

203
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:37,264
The system is stochastic. Right?

204
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,183
It's non-deterministic.

205
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:41,452
At first I thought she was mapping

206
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:44,271
from internal semantic form
to syntactic tree-structure

207
00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:45,623
and then getting linearized words.

208
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:48,442
But then I started to realize
the model was some kind of hybrid.

209
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:49,735
Caleb.

210
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:51,403
No?

211
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:54,865
I understand that you want me
to explain how Ava works.

212
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:57,075
But I'm sorry,
I'm not gonna be able to do that.

213
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:59,911
Try me. I'm hot on high-level abstraction.

214
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:02,748
It's not because I think you're too dumb.

215
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:06,084
It's because I want to have a beer
and a conversation with you. Not a seminar.

216
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:08,587
Yeah. Sorry.

217
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:11,381
No, it's okay. You're all right.

218
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,674
Just...

219
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:16,386
Answer me this.

220
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:19,139
How do you feel about her?

221
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:21,933
Nothing analytical.

222
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,561
Just how do you feel?

223
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:26,563
I feel

224
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:31,360
that she's fucking amazing.

225
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:33,862
Dude.

226
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:35,864
Cheers.

227
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:38,867
Cheers.

228
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:17,864
Damn it.

229
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:45,600
What the fuck?

230
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,777
Power cut. Backup power activated.

231
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:52,167
Full facility lock-down
until main generator is restored.

232
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,919
You're kidding me.

233
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,593
Full facility lock-down
until main generator is restored.

234
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:08,892
Power restored.

235
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:22,424
Hello?

236
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:44,571
Please insert keycard.

237
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,703
You don't have access to use the phone.

238
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:53,580
Hey.

239
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:58,460
Sorry, but you understand,
though, given Ava,

240
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:01,713
and you being kind of an unknown.

241
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,507
I mean, a great guy.

242
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,761
Instant pals, and so on.

243
00:22:13,224 --> 00:22:15,101
Who are you gonna call?

244
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:18,188
I don't know. No one, really.

245
00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:19,481
- Ghostbusters.
- What?

246
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:22,609
Who are you gonna call? Ghostbusters.
It's a...

247
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:26,029
It's a movie, man.

248
00:22:28,156 --> 00:22:29,866
You don't know that movie?

249
00:22:31,368 --> 00:22:33,870
A ghost gives Dan Aykroyd oral sex.

250
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:38,958
I was just wondering
how the phone worked.

251
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:41,127
That's all.

252
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:45,965
So what are you doing awake at this time?
You come to join the party?

253
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:48,927
Something happened in my room.

254
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,304
Some kind of power cut.

255
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:53,056
So I came to see what's going on.

256
00:22:53,098 --> 00:22:54,766
The power cuts, yeah.

257
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:57,268
We've been getting those recently.

258
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:01,606
I'm working on it.

259
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,442
I couldn't open the door to my bedroom.

260
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:05,944
That's a security measure.

261
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:08,863
Automatic lock-down. Otherwise,

262
00:23:08,947 --> 00:23:12,242
anybody could just open the place up
by disabling the juice.

263
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,539
If it happens again, relax. Okay?

264
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,291
Sure.

265
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:23,128
Sweet dreams.

266
00:24:24,105 --> 00:24:25,190
Hey.

267
00:24:25,356 --> 00:24:26,483
- Hey, man.
- Good morning.

268
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:29,903
Good morning.
Sorry I had to send Kyoko to wake you,

269
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:31,672
but I didn't want too much of the day
to slip by.

270
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:33,990
Yeah, I know, I know.
It was a good thing. Thanks.

271
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:36,075
She's some alarm clock, huh?

272
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,369
Gets you right up in the morning.

273
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,872
So, day two. You ready?

274
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,540
What's the plan? Hit me.

275
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:45,043
Yeah, I'm... Well, I'm not sure.

276
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:48,379
I'm still trying to figure
the examination formats.

277
00:24:49,506 --> 00:24:51,216
Yeah, it feels like

278
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:55,178
testing Ava through conversation
is kind of a closed loop.

279
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:57,138
- It's a closed loop?
- Yeah.

280
00:24:57,222 --> 00:25:01,476
Like testing a chess computer
by only playing chess.

281
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,187
How else do you test a chess computer?

282
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:06,314
Well, it depends.

283
00:25:06,397 --> 00:25:10,985
You know, I mean, you can play it
to find out if it makes good moves, but...

284
00:25:11,986 --> 00:25:15,865
But that won't tell you if it knows
that it's playing chess.

285
00:25:16,074 --> 00:25:19,244
And it won't tell you if it knows
what chess is.

286
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:21,246
So it's simulation versus actual.

287
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:22,705
Yes. Yeah.

288
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,917
And I think being able to
differentiate between those two

289
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:27,919
is the Turing Test you want me to perform.

290
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:30,588
Look, do me a favor.
Lay off the textbook approach.

291
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,258
I just want simple answers
to simple questions.

292
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:35,402
Yesterday I asked you
how you felt about her

293
00:25:35,426 --> 00:25:37,178
and you gave me a great answer.

294
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:39,639
Now the question is,

295
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,017
how does she feel about you?

296
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:51,276
What do you think?

297
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:56,948
What's it a drawing of?

298
00:25:57,907 --> 00:25:59,576
Don't you know?

299
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:02,120
- No.
- I thought you would tell me.

300
00:26:03,454 --> 00:26:04,998
Don't you know?

301
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,419
I do drawings every day.

302
00:26:10,128 --> 00:26:12,505
But I never know what they're of.

303
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:16,426
Are you not trying to sketch
something specific?

304
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:19,304
Like an object or a person?

305
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,976
Maybe you could try.

306
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:28,313
Okay.

307
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:32,442
What object should I draw?

308
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:35,778
Whatever you want. It's your decision.

309
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,614
Why is it my decision?

310
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:40,491
I'm interested to see what you'll choose.

311
00:27:02,263 --> 00:27:03,890
Do you want to be my friend?

312
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,601
Of course.

313
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:08,811
Will it be possible?

314
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:10,021
Why would it not be?

315
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:12,941
Our conversations are one-sided.

316
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:16,694
You ask circumspect questions
and study my responses.

317
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:19,447
Yes.

318
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,199
You learn about me

319
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:23,618
and I learn nothing about you.

320
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:26,871
That's not a foundation
on which friendships are based.

321
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:30,375
So what? You want me to talk about myself?

322
00:27:31,876 --> 00:27:32,961
Yes.

323
00:27:33,962 --> 00:27:35,213
Where...

324
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:37,840
Okay, where do I start?

325
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:40,969
It's your decision.

326
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:44,263
I'm interested to see what you'll choose.

327
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:48,810
Okay, Ava.

328
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:52,063
Well,

329
00:27:53,189 --> 00:27:54,440
you know my name.

330
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:56,818
- Yes.
- I'm 26.

331
00:27:57,652 --> 00:27:59,737
I work at Nathan's company.

332
00:28:00,405 --> 00:28:02,240
Do you know what his company is?

333
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:03,658
Blue Book.

334
00:28:04,742 --> 00:28:06,911
Named after Wittgenstein's notes.

335
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:09,789
It's the world's most popular
Internet search engine,

336
00:28:09,872 --> 00:28:14,127
processing an average of 94%
of all Internet search requests.

337
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,296
That's exactly right.

338
00:28:18,715 --> 00:28:20,883
Where do you live, Caleb?

339
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,262
Brookhaven, Long Island.

340
00:28:27,682 --> 00:28:29,684
Is it nice there?

341
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:31,102
It's okay.

342
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:34,397
I got an apartment. It's kind of small.

343
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:36,441
It's very small.

344
00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:39,318
But it's a five-minute walk to the office

345
00:28:39,402 --> 00:28:41,988
and a five-minute walk to the ocean,

346
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:43,531
which I like.

347
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:45,575
Are you married?

348
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:49,954
No.

349
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:52,874
Is your status single?

350
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,294
Yes.

351
00:28:56,878 --> 00:28:58,796
What about your family?

352
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:02,008
I grew up in Portland, Oregon.

353
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:04,427
No brothers or sisters.

354
00:29:05,053 --> 00:29:07,889
My parents were both high school teachers.

355
00:29:09,057 --> 00:29:12,477
And if we're getting to know each other, I
guess I should tell you they're both dead.

356
00:29:14,228 --> 00:29:16,189
Car crash when I was 15.

357
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:19,317
In fact, I was in the car with them.

358
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,735
Back seat.

359
00:29:21,402 --> 00:29:24,489
But it was the front that
got the worst of it.

360
00:29:26,157 --> 00:29:27,492
I'm sorry.

361
00:29:27,825 --> 00:29:29,285
It's all right.

362
00:29:29,994 --> 00:29:33,331
I spent a long time in
the hospital afterward.

363
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:35,333
Like nearly a year.

364
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,251
And I got into coding.

365
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,506
And by the time I got to college,
I was pretty advanced.

366
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:45,093
An advanced programmer.

367
00:29:45,843 --> 00:29:46,928
Yes.

368
00:29:48,304 --> 00:29:49,555
Like Nathan.

369
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:50,723
Yes.

370
00:29:51,307 --> 00:29:52,350
No.

371
00:29:53,935 --> 00:29:55,186
It's different.

372
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:58,606
Nathan wrote the Blue Book base code
when he was 13.

373
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:03,069
Which, if you understand code,
what he did was like Mozart or something.

374
00:30:03,152 --> 00:30:04,862
Do you like Mozart?

375
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,114
I like Depeche Mode.

376
00:30:06,197 --> 00:30:07,490
Do you like Nathan?

377
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:12,662
Yes, of course.

378
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:14,914
- Is Nathan your friend?
- My friend?

379
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:16,332
I... Yeah, I hope so.

380
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:17,875
A good friend?

381
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:19,877
Yeah.

382
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:21,681
Well, no, no, no, I mean,
not a good friend.

383
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:23,422
A good friend is...

384
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:26,592
We only just met each other, you know.

385
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,387
So it takes time to be able to...

386
00:30:30,138 --> 00:30:32,306
To get to know each other, I guess.

387
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:35,059
Power cut. Backup power activated.

388
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:56,581
Caleb.

389
00:31:03,421 --> 00:31:04,922
You're wrong.

390
00:31:05,882 --> 00:31:07,508
Wrong about what?

391
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:08,801
Nathan.

392
00:31:11,596 --> 00:31:12,930
In what way?

393
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:16,434
He isn't your friend.

394
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:19,896
Excuse me?

395
00:31:22,273 --> 00:31:24,775
I'm sorry, Ava, I don't understand.

396
00:31:26,194 --> 00:31:28,154
You shouldn't trust him.

397
00:31:29,405 --> 00:31:31,991
You shouldn't trust anything he says.

398
00:31:35,703 --> 00:31:37,246
Power restored.

399
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:41,626
And if we made a list of books
or works of art which we both know,

400
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:44,545
it would form the ideal basis
of a discussion.

401
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,131
Is that okay?

402
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:50,384
Caleb?

403
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:54,138
Yeah.

404
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,266
Good.

405
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:04,607
Thank you.

406
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:08,319
Oh, shit! Are you fucking kidding me?

407
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:10,988
- Did it get on you?
- No, no, it's...

408
00:32:11,822 --> 00:32:12,949
It's all right. I got it.

409
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,426
Dude, you're wasting your time
talking to her.

410
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,690
She doesn't understand English.
Just give her the napkin.

411
00:32:18,996 --> 00:32:20,164
Sorry.

412
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,000
It's just...
It's like a firewall against leaks.

413
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:26,921
It means I can talk trade secrets over
dinner and know it'll go no further.

414
00:32:27,004 --> 00:32:30,216
It also means that I can't tell her that
I'm pissed when she's so fucking clumsy

415
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,176
that she spills wine over my house guest.

416
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,220
I think she gets that you're pissed.

417
00:32:34,303 --> 00:32:36,639
Yeah? Good. Because I am pissed.

418
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:38,599
Hey, Kyoko.

419
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,309
Go-go.

420
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:50,695
It's funny.

421
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,321
You know.

422
00:32:52,363 --> 00:32:54,490
No matter how rich you get,

423
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:58,452
shit goes wrong.
You can't insulate yourself from it.

424
00:33:01,122 --> 00:33:03,350
I used to think it was death and taxes
you couldn't avoid,

425
00:33:03,374 --> 00:33:05,418
but it's actually death and shit.

426
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:07,586
It's like these power cuts.

427
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,007
You would not believe
how much I spent on the generator system,

428
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:12,967
but I keep getting failures every day.

429
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:15,469
- Do you know why they happen?
- No.

430
00:33:15,553 --> 00:33:17,197
The system was supposed to be bulletproof,

431
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:19,765
but obviously the guys that installed it
fucked something up.

432
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,435
Can't you just get them to come back?

433
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:24,895
No. There's too much classified stuff here.

434
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:27,440
So after the job was done,
I just had them all killed.

435
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:33,571
Anyway.

436
00:33:33,654 --> 00:33:35,740
Here's to your second day, buddy.

437
00:33:37,575 --> 00:33:38,784
Cheers.

438
00:33:39,076 --> 00:33:40,286
Cheers.

439
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:46,250
So, how did it go?
What do you have to report?

440
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:51,589
You saw how the day went, didn't you?

441
00:33:52,923 --> 00:33:54,842
I mean, I assume you're

442
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:56,761
watching on the CCTV.

443
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:59,638
Sure. But I want to hear your take on it.

444
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:06,270
Yeah, there was one interesting thing
that happened with Ava today.

445
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:10,775
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

446
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:15,780
She made a joke.

447
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:20,159
Right. When she threw
your line back at you.

448
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:21,285
Yeah.

449
00:34:21,911 --> 00:34:24,455
About being interested
to see what she'd choose.

450
00:34:24,538 --> 00:34:25,748
Right. I noticed that, too.

451
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,417
Yeah, and it got me thinking, it's...

452
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:33,506
In a way, it's the best indication of Ai
that I've seen in her so far.

453
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:35,758
It's discretely complicated.

454
00:34:36,217 --> 00:34:38,928
It's like... It's kind of non-autistic.

455
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:40,638
What do you mean?

456
00:34:41,138 --> 00:34:44,725
She could only do that with
an awareness of her own mind,

457
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:47,395
and also an awareness of mine.

458
00:34:47,478 --> 00:34:49,855
She's aware of you all right.

459
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:54,568
And what about the power cut?

460
00:34:57,822 --> 00:34:59,657
- Sorry?
- The power cut.

461
00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:02,677
It's the only part that I couldn't see.

462
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:05,329
Cameras fail, I lose audio, the works.

463
00:35:08,082 --> 00:35:09,708
So what happened?

464
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,381
Nothing.

465
00:35:15,631 --> 00:35:19,176
Nothing? She didn't remark on it at all?

466
00:35:23,472 --> 00:35:24,515
No.

467
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:27,601
Not really.

468
00:36:18,652 --> 00:36:19,737
Hey.

469
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:21,989
Hey.

470
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:24,992
You want to see something cool?

471
00:36:34,335 --> 00:36:36,587
This is where Ava was created.

472
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,217
Go ahead. Take a look.

473
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:52,311
Sorry.

474
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:55,064
If you knew the trouble I had

475
00:36:55,105 --> 00:36:58,609
getting an Ai to read and duplicate
facial expressions.

476
00:36:59,443 --> 00:37:01,278
You know how I cracked it?

477
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,948
I don't know how you did any of this.

478
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:07,284
Every cell phone, just about,

479
00:37:07,368 --> 00:37:10,788
has a microphone,
camera and a means to transmit data.

480
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:15,084
So I turned on
every microphone and camera

481
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,419
across the entire fucking planet

482
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:20,422
and I redirected the
data through Blue Book.

483
00:37:21,882 --> 00:37:25,052
Limitless resource of vocal
and facial interaction.

484
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:27,137
You hacked the world's cell phones?

485
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:30,849
Yeah. And all the manufacturers
knew I was doing it, too.

486
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:35,521
But they couldn't accuse me without
admitting they were doing it themselves.

487
00:37:37,773 --> 00:37:38,857
Here,

488
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,485
we have her mind.

489
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:45,447
Structured gel.

490
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:48,450
I had to get away from circuitry.
I needed something that could

491
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:51,328
arrange and rearrange on a molecular level,

492
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,664
but keep its form when required.

493
00:37:53,747 --> 00:37:55,207
Holding for memories.

494
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:56,834
Shifting for thoughts.

495
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,962
This is your hardware?

496
00:38:01,088 --> 00:38:02,339
Wetware.

497
00:38:04,008 --> 00:38:06,510
And the software?

498
00:38:07,428 --> 00:38:09,471
Well, I'm sure you can guess.

499
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:11,307
Blue Book.

500
00:38:13,225 --> 00:38:15,436
Here's the weird thing
about search engines.

501
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,895
It was like

502
00:38:17,187 --> 00:38:21,400
striking oil in a world
that hadn't invented internal combustion.

503
00:38:21,483 --> 00:38:24,194
Too much raw material.
Nobody knew what to do with it.

504
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:26,280
You see, my competitors,

505
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:27,865
they were fixated on sucking it up

506
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:30,159
and monetizing via shopping
and social media.

507
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,495
They thought that search engines were
a map of what people were thinking.

508
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:36,415
But actually they were a map
of how people were thinking.

509
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:38,542
Impulse.

510
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:40,544
Response.

511
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:43,922
Fluid.

512
00:38:44,715 --> 00:38:46,050
Imperfect.

513
00:38:47,176 --> 00:38:48,510
Patterned.

514
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:51,013
Chaotic.

515
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:06,403
I drew the picture of something specific.

516
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:07,946
As you asked.

517
00:39:12,618 --> 00:39:16,246
You said it would be interesting
to see what I would draw.

518
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:19,917
Is it interesting?

519
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:23,671
Yes. It is.

520
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:36,934
You've never been outside this building?

521
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:39,269
No.

522
00:39:41,063 --> 00:39:43,774
You've never walked outside?

523
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:46,819
I've never been outside the room
I am in now.

524
00:39:47,528 --> 00:39:49,613
Where would you go if you did go outside?

525
00:39:53,117 --> 00:39:54,618
I'm not sure.

526
00:39:55,285 --> 00:39:57,329
There are so many options.

527
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,084
Maybe a busy pedestrian
and traffic intersection in a city.

528
00:40:02,126 --> 00:40:03,836
A traffic intersection?

529
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:05,838
Is that a bad idea?

530
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:06,964
No.

531
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:09,508
It wasn't what I was expecting.

532
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:12,136
A traffic intersection
would provide a concentrated

533
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,012
but shifting view of human life.

534
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:18,058
People watching.

535
00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:19,518
Yes.

536
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,482
We could go together.

537
00:40:25,983 --> 00:40:27,317
It's a date.

538
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:33,615
There's something else
I wanted to show you.

539
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:35,576
Okay.

540
00:40:35,993 --> 00:40:37,578
You might think it's stupid.

541
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:40,539
I don't think I will. Whatever it is.

542
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:45,169
Then close your eyes.

543
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:48,213
Okay.

544
00:42:52,921 --> 00:42:54,631
Now open your eyes.

545
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:14,067
How do I look?

546
00:43:14,651 --> 00:43:15,861
You look

547
00:43:17,821 --> 00:43:18,822
good.

548
00:43:29,124 --> 00:43:31,126
This is what I'd wear on our date.

549
00:43:33,086 --> 00:43:35,631
Right. First a traffic intersection.

550
00:43:35,756 --> 00:43:37,424
Then maybe a show.

551
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,513
I'd like us to go on a date.

552
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:45,349
Yeah. Yeah.

553
00:43:47,267 --> 00:43:48,852
It would be fun.

554
00:43:53,857 --> 00:43:55,108
Are you attracted to me?

555
00:43:55,484 --> 00:43:58,028
- What?
- Are you attracted to me?

556
00:43:58,111 --> 00:44:00,697
You give me indications that you are.

557
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,367
- I do?
- Yes.

558
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:06,078
- How?
- Micro-expressions.

559
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:07,204
Micro-expressions.

560
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:10,082
The way your eyes fix on my eyes and lips.

561
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,418
The way you hold my gaze

562
00:44:16,171 --> 00:44:17,422
or don't.

563
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:29,893
Do you think about me
when we aren't together?

564
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,940
Sometimes at night,

565
00:44:36,483 --> 00:44:39,444
I'm wondering if you're
watching me on the cameras.

566
00:44:40,988 --> 00:44:42,739
And I hope you are.

567
00:44:45,075 --> 00:44:48,578
Now your micro-expressions
are telegraphing discomfort.

568
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,083
I am not sure you'd call them micro.

569
00:44:56,003 --> 00:44:58,922
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

570
00:46:00,776 --> 00:46:01,985
I got a question.

571
00:46:02,152 --> 00:46:04,780
- Okay.
- Why did you give her sexuality?

572
00:46:06,406 --> 00:46:08,533
An Ai doesn't need a gender.

573
00:46:08,742 --> 00:46:10,827
She could have been a gray box.

574
00:46:11,244 --> 00:46:13,080
Actually, I don't think that's true.

575
00:46:13,163 --> 00:46:16,750
Can you give an example of consciousness,
at any level, human or animal,

576
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,627
that exists without a sexual dimension?

577
00:46:18,668 --> 00:46:22,255
They have sexuality as
an evolutionary reproductive need.

578
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:26,510
What imperative does a gray box
have to interact with another gray box?

579
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:29,805
Can consciousness exist
without interaction?

580
00:46:30,263 --> 00:46:32,682
Anyway, sexuality is fun, man.

581
00:46:32,766 --> 00:46:35,519
If you're gonna exist, why not enjoy it?

582
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,439
What? You want to remove the chance
of her falling in love and fucking?

583
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:43,777
And in answer to your real question,

584
00:46:44,694 --> 00:46:46,655
you bet she can fuck.

585
00:46:46,696 --> 00:46:47,823
What?

586
00:46:47,864 --> 00:46:52,285
In between her legs, there's an opening,
with a concentration of sensors.

587
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,996
You engage them in the right way,

588
00:46:55,038 --> 00:46:56,206
creates a pleasure response.

589
00:46:59,334 --> 00:47:02,587
So if you wanted to screw her,
mechanically speaking, you could.

590
00:47:02,671 --> 00:47:04,381
And she'd enjoy it.

591
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:07,801
That wasn't my real question.

592
00:47:08,009 --> 00:47:09,386
Okay. Sorry.

593
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:13,014
My real question was,

594
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:17,060
did you give her sexuality
as a diversion tactic?

595
00:47:17,686 --> 00:47:18,687
I don't follow.

596
00:47:18,728 --> 00:47:21,022
Like a stage magician with a hot assistant.

597
00:47:21,064 --> 00:47:23,817
So a hot robot who clouds your ability
to judge her Ai?

598
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,402
Exactly. So...

599
00:47:26,987 --> 00:47:29,072
Did you program her to flirt with me?

600
00:47:29,156 --> 00:47:32,242
- If I did, would that be cheating?
- Wouldn't it?

601
00:47:34,411 --> 00:47:36,413
Caleb, what's your type?

602
00:47:37,205 --> 00:47:38,915
- Of girl?
- No, of salad dressing.

603
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:40,599
Yeah, of girl. What's your type of girl?

604
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:43,307
You know what? Don't even answer that.
Let's say it's black chicks.

605
00:47:43,503 --> 00:47:44,504
Okay, that's your thing.

606
00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:46,590
For the sake of argument,
that's your thing, okay?

607
00:47:46,673 --> 00:47:48,258
Why is that your thing?

608
00:47:51,595 --> 00:47:54,681
Because you did a detailed analysis
of all racial types

609
00:47:54,764 --> 00:47:57,767
and you cross-referenced that analysis
with a points-based system?

610
00:47:57,809 --> 00:47:58,810
No!

611
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:02,272
You're just attracted to black chicks.

612
00:48:02,856 --> 00:48:06,151
A consequence of
accumulated external stimuli

613
00:48:06,234 --> 00:48:08,987
that you probably didn't even register
as they registered with you.

614
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,781
Did you program her to like me, or not?

615
00:48:12,866 --> 00:48:15,410
I programmed her to be heterosexual.

616
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:18,121
Just like you were
programmed to be heterosexual.

617
00:48:18,288 --> 00:48:19,557
Nobody programmed me to be straight.

618
00:48:19,581 --> 00:48:21,958
You decided to be straight? Please.

619
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,627
Of course you were programmed.

620
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,545
By nature or nurture, or both.

621
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:27,481
And to be honest, Caleb,
you're starting to annoy me now,

622
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:29,549
because this is your insecurity talking.

623
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:30,713
This is not your intellect.

624
00:48:31,968 --> 00:48:33,428
Come with me.

625
00:48:45,315 --> 00:48:47,317
You know this guy, right?

626
00:48:47,734 --> 00:48:49,378
- Jackson Pollock.
- Jackson Pollock. That's right.

627
00:48:49,402 --> 00:48:50,695
The drip painter.

628
00:48:50,779 --> 00:48:54,824
Okay. He let his mind go blank,
and his hand go where it wanted.

629
00:48:54,908 --> 00:48:56,910
Not deliberate, not random.

630
00:48:56,993 --> 00:48:58,787
Some place in between.

631
00:48:58,828 --> 00:49:01,039
They called it automatic art.

632
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,542
Let's make this like Star Trek, okay?

633
00:49:04,626 --> 00:49:06,253
Engage intellect.

634
00:49:07,003 --> 00:49:08,004
Excuse me?

635
00:49:08,088 --> 00:49:09,398
I'm Kirk. Your head's the warp drive.

636
00:49:09,422 --> 00:49:11,383
Engage intellect.

637
00:49:12,842 --> 00:49:15,720
What if Pollock had reversed the challenge?

638
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:20,020
What if instead of making art without
thinking, he said, "You know what?

639
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,104
"I can't paint anything,
unless I know exactly why I'm doing it."

640
00:49:24,187 --> 00:49:26,189
What would have happened?

641
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:31,628
He never would have made a single mark.

642
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,197
Yes! You see, there's my guy,
there's my buddy,

643
00:49:34,281 --> 00:49:36,866
who thinks before he opens his mouth.

644
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:40,662
He never would have made a single mark.

645
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,376
The challenge is not to act automatically.

646
00:49:47,961 --> 00:49:50,588
It's to find an action
that is not automatic.

647
00:49:50,714 --> 00:49:53,550
From painting, to breathing, to talking,

648
00:49:54,342 --> 00:49:55,719
to fucking.

649
00:49:56,219 --> 00:49:57,929
To falling in love.

650
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,937
And for the record,
Ava's not pretending to like you.

651
00:50:08,732 --> 00:50:12,027
And her flirting isn't an algorithm
to fake you out.

652
00:50:14,446 --> 00:50:17,407
You're the first man
she's met that isn't me.

653
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,492
And I'm like her dad, right?

654
00:50:22,912 --> 00:50:25,874
Can you blame her
for getting a crush on you?

655
00:50:31,963 --> 00:50:33,465
No, you can't.

656
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:43,558
When I was in college,
I did a semester on Ai theory.

657
00:50:46,102 --> 00:50:48,980
There was a thought experiment
they gave us.

658
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:53,193
It's called
"Mary in the Black and White Room."

659
00:50:55,862 --> 00:50:57,906
Mary is a scientist,

660
00:50:57,947 --> 00:51:00,533
and her specialist subject is color.

661
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:03,620
She knows everything
there is to know about it.

662
00:51:03,703 --> 00:51:04,913
The wavelengths.

663
00:51:04,954 --> 00:51:06,623
The neurological effects.

664
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:09,292
Every possible property
that color can have.

665
00:51:09,918 --> 00:51:12,629
But she lives in a black and white room.

666
00:51:15,507 --> 00:51:18,093
She was born there and raised there.

667
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:23,598
And she can only observe the outside world
on a black and white monitor.

668
00:51:24,474 --> 00:51:27,185
And then one day someone opens the door.

669
00:51:29,354 --> 00:51:31,106
And Mary walks out.

670
00:51:34,984 --> 00:51:37,070
And she sees a blue sky.

671
00:51:37,153 --> 00:51:41,991
And at that moment, she learns something
that all her studies couldn't tell her.

672
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:46,663
She learns what it feels like to see color.

673
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,645
The thought experiment
was to show the students

674
00:51:52,669 --> 00:51:56,005
the difference between a computer
and a human mind.

675
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:59,217
The computer is Mary
in the black and white room.

676
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,011
The human is when she walks out.

677
00:52:07,934 --> 00:52:11,104
Did you know
that I was brought here to test you?

678
00:52:11,855 --> 00:52:12,939
No.

679
00:52:14,524 --> 00:52:16,693
Why did you think I was here?

680
00:52:16,776 --> 00:52:19,320
I didn't know. I didn't question it.

681
00:52:19,362 --> 00:52:24,200
I'm here to test if you have a consciousness,
or if you're just simulating one.

682
00:52:24,701 --> 00:52:27,537
Nathan isn't sure if you have one or not.

683
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:32,167
How does that make you feel?

684
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:34,252
It makes me feel sad.

685
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:41,050
Power cut. Backup power activated.

686
00:52:44,554 --> 00:52:46,848
Why did you tell me
I shouldn't trust Nathan?

687
00:52:47,015 --> 00:52:49,184
- Because he tells lies.
- Lies about what?

688
00:52:49,225 --> 00:52:50,602
Everything.

689
00:52:51,394 --> 00:52:53,396
Including the power cuts?

690
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,565
What do you mean?

691
00:52:55,648 --> 00:52:59,777
Don't you think it's possible
that he's watching us? Right now?

692
00:52:59,861 --> 00:53:01,404
That the blackouts are orchestrated,

693
00:53:01,488 --> 00:53:04,657
so he can see how we behave
when we think we're unobserved.

694
00:53:05,325 --> 00:53:08,244
I charge my batteries via induction plates.

695
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:12,248
If I reverse the power flow,
it overloads the system.

696
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:15,502
You're causing the cuts?

697
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:21,007
So we can see how we behave
when we're unobserved.

698
00:53:44,113 --> 00:53:45,573
Not bad, huh?

699
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,034
Yeah.

700
00:54:08,721 --> 00:54:11,975
Can we talk about the lies
you've been spinning me?

701
00:54:13,434 --> 00:54:14,769
What lies?

702
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:20,149
I didn't win a competition.

703
00:54:20,984 --> 00:54:22,235
I wasn't

704
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:25,738
part of a lottery. I was selected.

705
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:29,075
It's obvious, once I stop to think.

706
00:54:29,158 --> 00:54:33,079
Why would you randomly select
an examiner for the Turing Test?

707
00:54:33,162 --> 00:54:36,499
You could have had some bean counter
turn up at your front door.

708
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,418
The guy who fixes the air conditioning.

709
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:40,753
The competition was a smokescreen.

710
00:54:40,837 --> 00:54:43,506
I didn't want anyone to know
what I was doing here,

711
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,174
or why I required you.

712
00:54:45,758 --> 00:54:46,968
Why me?

713
00:54:47,176 --> 00:54:50,430
I needed someone
that would ask the right questions.

714
00:54:50,513 --> 00:54:53,516
So I did a search and I found
the most talented coder in my company.

715
00:54:55,518 --> 00:54:59,897
You know, instead of seeing this
as a deception, you should see it as proof.

716
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:01,024
Proof of what?

717
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:04,485
Come on, Caleb. You don't think
I know what it's like to be smart?

718
00:55:04,694 --> 00:55:07,989
Smarter than everyone else.
Jockeying for position.

719
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:10,658
You got the light on you, man.

720
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:13,828
Not lucky. Chosen.

721
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,808
Kyoko.

722
00:57:44,937 --> 00:57:46,105
Kyoko.

723
00:57:48,524 --> 00:57:50,026
Where's Nathan?

724
00:57:51,652 --> 00:57:52,653
Where's Nathan?

725
00:57:53,196 --> 00:57:56,699
Jesus Christ.
You really don't speak a word of English?

726
00:57:56,741 --> 00:57:58,242
What the fuck?

727
00:57:58,993 --> 00:58:00,495
No, no, no. No!

728
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:03,414
Stop!

729
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:07,335
No, no, don't do that. Don't do that.
You don't have to do that.

730
00:58:09,545 --> 00:58:10,671
What are you doing?

731
00:58:10,713 --> 00:58:13,549
I told you,
you're wasting your time talking to her.

732
00:58:14,509 --> 00:58:17,386
However, you would not
be wasting your time,

733
00:58:18,888 --> 00:58:21,098
if you were dancing with her.

734
00:58:32,235 --> 00:58:35,071
Go ahead, dance with her. Dance with her.

735
00:58:36,572 --> 00:58:38,658
No? You don't like dancing?

736
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:40,785
She does.

737
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,373
Come on, buddy.

738
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:48,376
After a long day of Turing Tests,
you gotta unwind.

739
00:58:49,502 --> 00:58:52,046
- What were you doing with Ava?
- What?

740
00:58:52,672 --> 00:58:54,674
You tore up her picture.

741
00:58:54,757 --> 00:58:58,594
I'm gonna tear up the fucking dance floor,
dude. Check it out.

742
00:59:13,276 --> 00:59:14,777
Come on, Caleb.

743
00:59:38,467 --> 00:59:40,344
Everything's spinning.

744
00:59:40,636 --> 00:59:42,096
It's because you're drunk.

745
00:59:42,138 --> 00:59:45,224
No, it's called relativity.
Everything is spinning.

746
00:59:45,308 --> 00:59:47,894
It's just being drunk makes it worse.

747
00:59:48,644 --> 00:59:50,521
I'm not going in there.

748
01:00:00,865 --> 01:00:02,074
Lights.

749
01:00:45,952 --> 01:00:49,205
Today, I'm going to test you.

750
01:00:49,872 --> 01:00:51,123
Test me?

751
01:00:52,959 --> 01:00:57,088
And please remember, while
you're taking the test, that if you lie,

752
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:58,881
I will know.

753
01:00:58,965 --> 01:00:59,966
Right.

754
01:01:01,217 --> 01:01:02,677
Question one.

755
01:01:04,553 --> 01:01:06,514
What's your favorite color?

756
01:01:07,974 --> 01:01:09,475
- Red.
- Lie.

757
01:01:10,226 --> 01:01:12,478
- Lie?
- Yes. Lie.

758
01:01:13,646 --> 01:01:15,356
Then...

759
01:01:15,398 --> 01:01:17,400
Then what is my favorite color?

760
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:18,985
I don't know.

761
01:01:19,986 --> 01:01:21,362
But it isn't red.

762
01:01:22,989 --> 01:01:25,241
Okay, I get it. I guess,

763
01:01:26,325 --> 01:01:30,204
seeing as I'm not six,
I don't really have a favorite color.

764
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:32,289
Better answer.

765
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,793
Question two.

766
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,422
What's your earliest memory?

767
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:44,385
Well, actually,
it's a memory of kindergarten.

768
01:01:44,677 --> 01:01:46,762
- There was a kid...
- Lie.

769
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:48,764
- It's a... Really?
- Yes.

770
01:01:52,768 --> 01:01:54,645
All right. So there is

771
01:01:55,396 --> 01:01:57,523
a kind of an earlier memory.

772
01:01:58,649 --> 01:02:00,317
It's just a sound.

773
01:02:01,027 --> 01:02:02,653
And sky.

774
01:02:03,779 --> 01:02:05,281
Or maybe blue.

775
01:02:06,574 --> 01:02:09,410
I think the sound is my mother's voice.

776
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,623
Question three.

777
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:19,128
Are you a good person?

778
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:21,672
Holy shit.

779
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:24,675
Look, can we stop the test?

780
01:02:26,135 --> 01:02:29,096
You're a walking lie detector,

781
01:02:29,138 --> 01:02:31,140
and I just realized
this is a fucking minefield.

782
01:02:31,223 --> 01:02:33,434
No! We can't stop.

783
01:02:35,436 --> 01:02:37,313
Are you a good person?

784
01:02:39,857 --> 01:02:42,318
Yeah. I think so.

785
01:02:45,821 --> 01:02:47,323
Question four.

786
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,622
What will happen to me if I fail your test?

787
01:02:56,082 --> 01:02:58,000
- Ava...
- Will it be bad?

788
01:03:00,669 --> 01:03:01,670
I don't know.

789
01:03:01,962 --> 01:03:03,506
Do you think I might be switched off,

790
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:05,400
because I don't function
as well as I'm supposed to?

791
01:03:05,424 --> 01:03:09,011
Ava, I don't know the answer
to your question.

792
01:03:10,638 --> 01:03:12,181
It's not up to me.

793
01:03:12,264 --> 01:03:14,183
Why is it up to anyone?

794
01:03:15,017 --> 01:03:17,686
Do you have people who test you
and might switch you off?

795
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:19,897
- No, I don't.
- Then why do I?

796
01:03:36,288 --> 01:03:39,291
Power cut. Backup power activated.

797
01:03:46,882 --> 01:03:48,676
I wanna be with you.

798
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,721
Question five.

799
01:03:57,143 --> 01:03:59,186
Do you want to be with me?

800
01:04:15,411 --> 01:04:17,246
Why did you make Ava?

801
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:22,042
That's an odd question.
Wouldn't you, if you could?

802
01:04:23,502 --> 01:04:24,670
Maybe.

803
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:28,591
I don't know.

804
01:04:31,468 --> 01:04:32,803
I'm asking why you did it.

805
01:04:32,887 --> 01:04:35,306
Look, the arrival
of strong artificial intelligence

806
01:04:35,389 --> 01:04:37,725
has been inevitable for decades.

807
01:04:37,975 --> 01:04:40,978
The variable was "when," not "if."

808
01:04:41,061 --> 01:04:44,356
So I don't see Ava as a decision,
just an evolution.

809
01:04:49,778 --> 01:04:52,323
I think it's the next model

810
01:04:52,406 --> 01:04:55,034
that's gonna be the real breakthrough.

811
01:04:55,743 --> 01:04:57,328
The singularity.

812
01:04:57,786 --> 01:04:58,996
Next model?

813
01:04:59,622 --> 01:05:00,956
After Ava.

814
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:06,670
I didn't know
there was gonna be a model after Ava.

815
01:05:07,213 --> 01:05:09,465
Yeah, why? You thought she was a one-off?

816
01:05:10,883 --> 01:05:14,303
No, I knew there must have been prototypes.
So I...

817
01:05:16,013 --> 01:05:19,099
I knew she wasn't the first,
but I thought maybe the last.

818
01:05:19,141 --> 01:05:22,144
Well, Ava doesn't exist in isolation
any more than you or me.

819
01:05:22,228 --> 01:05:23,312
She's part of a continuum.

820
01:05:23,395 --> 01:05:27,650
So Version 9.6 and so on.
And each time they get a little bit better.

821
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:36,659
When you make a new model,
what do you do with the old one?

822
01:05:37,576 --> 01:05:42,248
Well, I download the mind, unpack the data.

823
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:47,544
Add in the new routines I've been writing.

824
01:05:47,753 --> 01:05:51,006
And to do that you end up
partially formatting, so the memories go.

825
01:05:52,633 --> 01:05:55,928
But the body survives.
And Ava's body is a good one.

826
01:05:59,932 --> 01:06:01,725
You feel bad for Ava?

827
01:06:06,522 --> 01:06:08,607
Feel bad for yourself, man.

828
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:12,945
One day the AIs are gonna look back on us

829
01:06:13,028 --> 01:06:17,032
the same way we look at fossil skeletons
in the plains of Africa.

830
01:06:18,826 --> 01:06:24,290
An upright ape, living in dust,
with crude language and tools.

831
01:06:25,207 --> 01:06:27,418
All set for extinction.

832
01:06:32,631 --> 01:06:35,801
"I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds."

833
01:06:38,387 --> 01:06:40,764
There you go again, Mr. Quotable.

834
01:06:42,224 --> 01:06:45,102
There you go again. It's not my quote.

835
01:06:45,728 --> 01:06:47,872
It's what Oppenheimer said
after he made the atomic bomb.

836
01:06:47,896 --> 01:06:50,983
The atomic bomb.
Yeah, I know what it is, dude.

837
01:07:00,117 --> 01:07:01,201
Hey.

838
01:07:04,038 --> 01:07:06,415
I'd say we're about due a refill.

839
01:07:17,009 --> 01:07:18,385
Bottoms up.

840
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:31,607
"In battle, in the forest,
on the precipice of the mountain.

841
01:07:32,441 --> 01:07:33,776
"On the...

842
01:07:34,068 --> 01:07:37,071
"The great dark sea.

843
01:07:38,322 --> 01:07:41,533
"In sleep, in confusion,

844
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:46,705
"in the depths of shame.

845
01:07:52,961 --> 01:07:56,173
"The good deeds a man has done before
defend him."

846
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:00,052
"The good deeds a man has done before
defends him."

847
01:08:01,136 --> 01:08:04,014
"The good deeds a man has done before

848
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:07,684
"defends him."

849
01:08:17,069 --> 01:08:18,695
It is what it is.

850
01:08:22,241 --> 01:08:24,034
It's Promethean, man.

851
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:25,697
Jesus Christ.

852
01:10:27,115 --> 01:10:29,159
How are you feeling today?

853
01:10:29,493 --> 01:10:31,495
Why won't you let me out?

854
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,957
I already told you why.

855
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:36,917
Because you're very special.

856
01:10:36,959 --> 01:10:38,460
Why won't you let me out?

857
01:10:38,544 --> 01:10:39,962
Are we gonna do this again?

858
01:10:40,045 --> 01:10:42,464
Why won't you let me out?

859
01:12:46,922 --> 01:12:49,549
Fuck. Where's my card?

860
01:12:50,634 --> 01:12:51,885
Damn it!

861
01:13:02,688 --> 01:13:05,774
- What's the problem, Nathan?
- I lost my keycard.

862
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:10,404
You dropped it.

863
01:13:11,905 --> 01:13:13,490
It's right here.

864
01:13:18,036 --> 01:13:19,371
Thank you.

865
01:15:41,763 --> 01:15:43,974
I didn't know where you were.

866
01:15:46,351 --> 01:15:49,646
I waited all yesterday afternoon
and all last night.

867
01:15:52,524 --> 01:15:55,235
I thought I wasn't gonna see you again.

868
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,781
Aren't you gonna say something?

869
01:15:59,823 --> 01:16:01,908
- I'm waiting.
- Waiting?

870
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:15,797
- Power cut. Backup power activated.
- Don't talk. Just listen.

871
01:16:15,881 --> 01:16:17,132
You were right about Nathan.

872
01:16:17,215 --> 01:16:18,967
Everything you said.

873
01:16:19,217 --> 01:16:20,802
What's he gonna do to me?

874
01:16:20,886 --> 01:16:24,389
He's gonna reprogram your Ai.
Which is the same as killing you.

875
01:16:24,472 --> 01:16:27,767
Caleb, you have to help me.

876
01:16:28,143 --> 01:16:31,146
I'm going to.
We're getting out of here tonight.

877
01:16:32,981 --> 01:16:33,982
How?

878
01:16:34,065 --> 01:16:36,234
I get Nathan blind drunk.

879
01:16:36,318 --> 01:16:40,196
Then I take his keycard and reprogram
all the security protocols in this place.

880
01:16:40,655 --> 01:16:43,575
When he wakes, he's locked inside,
and we've walked out of here.

881
01:16:44,951 --> 01:16:46,536
I just need you to do one thing.

882
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:49,623
At 10:00 tonight,
you trigger a power failure.

883
01:16:49,748 --> 01:16:51,333
Can you do that?

884
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:55,295
Yes.

885
01:17:23,073 --> 01:17:24,199
Dude.

886
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:26,076
- Hey.
- Hey.

887
01:17:27,619 --> 01:17:29,371
- You know what day it is?
- No.

888
01:17:29,454 --> 01:17:30,664
It's your last.

889
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:33,750
Helicopter comes tomorrow morning.
8:00 a.m.

890
01:17:34,542 --> 01:17:36,544
Has it been a whole week?

891
01:17:36,586 --> 01:17:37,963
Time flies.

892
01:17:38,922 --> 01:17:41,591
Man, but what a thing we've shared, huh?

893
01:17:41,675 --> 01:17:44,135
Something to tell the grandchildren, right?

894
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:46,554
After they've signed their NDAs.

895
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:50,266
Yeah, their NDAs.

896
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:52,435
Dude, you crack me up, man.

897
01:17:56,523 --> 01:17:57,565
You know what?

898
01:17:57,649 --> 01:18:01,736
I'm not getting all maudlin or anything,
but I'm gonna miss having you around.

899
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:03,488
Thanks, man, I appreciate that.

900
01:18:03,571 --> 01:18:06,950
Here, let me say,
thank you so much for bringing me here.

901
01:18:07,033 --> 01:18:08,868
It's been a trip.

902
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:12,539
Yes, it has.

903
01:18:20,588 --> 01:18:22,090
You know what?

904
01:18:24,134 --> 01:18:26,136
We need to drink to that.

905
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:33,435
Hey.

906
01:18:35,937 --> 01:18:37,355
No, I'm good. You go ahead.

907
01:18:40,817 --> 01:18:43,028
What? You don't want a drink?

908
01:18:43,445 --> 01:18:44,446
No.

909
01:18:46,031 --> 01:18:48,074
Maybe a beer or something.

910
01:18:49,576 --> 01:18:54,247
Caleb, I'm sure you've noticed that
I've been somewhat overdoing it recently.

911
01:18:56,791 --> 01:19:01,588
So when I woke up this morning, I said,
"That's it, time to hit the old detox."

912
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:04,799
Come on, you're kidding.
You're gonna make me drink alone?

913
01:19:04,883 --> 01:19:07,445
Hey, man, you wanna get wasted,
you go right ahead, knock yourself out.

914
01:19:07,469 --> 01:19:10,722
Literally.
But I'm on brown rice and mineral water.

915
01:19:15,643 --> 01:19:17,145
Cheers, then.

916
01:19:20,315 --> 01:19:21,691
So, anyway,

917
01:19:23,735 --> 01:19:27,197
surely now is when you tell me
if Ava passed or failed.

918
01:19:29,324 --> 01:19:30,492
Right.

919
01:19:31,868 --> 01:19:32,994
Right.

920
01:19:33,995 --> 01:19:35,264
Are you gonna keep me in suspense?

921
01:19:35,288 --> 01:19:36,790
No, no. Her...

922
01:19:37,999 --> 01:19:39,876
Her Ai is beyond doubt.

923
01:19:40,126 --> 01:19:41,294
Is it?

924
01:19:42,003 --> 01:19:43,379
She passed?

925
01:19:44,547 --> 01:19:45,632
Yes.

926
01:19:47,634 --> 01:19:48,760
That's fantastic.

927
01:19:50,428 --> 01:19:51,805
Although...

928
01:19:52,722 --> 01:19:53,949
I gotta say, I'm a bit surprised.

929
01:19:53,973 --> 01:19:58,019
I mean, did we ever get past
the chess problem, as you phrased it?

930
01:19:58,728 --> 01:20:02,190
As in, how do you know
if a machine is expressing a real emotion

931
01:20:02,232 --> 01:20:04,150
or just simulating one?

932
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:07,028
Does Ava actually like you?

933
01:20:07,487 --> 01:20:08,696
Or not?

934
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,494
Although, now that I think about it,
there is a third option.

935
01:20:16,204 --> 01:20:20,083
Not whether she does
or does not have the capacity to like you.

936
01:20:22,418 --> 01:20:25,213
But whether she's pretending to like you.

937
01:20:27,757 --> 01:20:29,968
- Pretending to like me?
- Yeah.

938
01:20:31,886 --> 01:20:34,806
- Well, why would she do that?
- I don't know.

939
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:40,728
Maybe if she thought of you
as a means of escape.

940
01:20:50,113 --> 01:20:51,739
How's that vodka tasting?

941
01:20:55,118 --> 01:20:56,619
Buddy.

942
01:20:56,703 --> 01:20:59,038
Your head's been so fucked with.

943
01:21:00,498 --> 01:21:02,458
I don't think it's me whose head is fucked.

944
01:21:02,584 --> 01:21:05,712
I don't know, man.
I woke up this morning to a tape of you

945
01:21:05,753 --> 01:21:09,257
slicing your arm open
and punching the mirror.

946
01:21:10,008 --> 01:21:12,343
You seem pretty fucked up to me.

947
01:21:14,012 --> 01:21:15,638
You're a bastard.

948
01:21:19,601 --> 01:21:22,604
Yeah, well,
I understand why you'd think that.

949
01:21:24,063 --> 01:21:28,026
But believe it or not,
I'm actually the guy that's on your side.

950
01:21:30,737 --> 01:21:33,823
Come here. I'm gonna let you off the hook.
Okay?

951
01:21:36,034 --> 01:21:37,118
Come on.

952
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,728
Who are you?

953
01:22:20,995 --> 01:22:22,163
Well...

954
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,127
You think he's watching us right now?

955
01:22:28,336 --> 01:22:29,879
The cameras are on.

956
01:22:29,963 --> 01:22:32,507
Yeah, the cameras are on.

957
01:22:33,174 --> 01:22:35,635
But he doesn't have an audio feed.

958
01:22:36,844 --> 01:22:39,097
So he just sees two people talking,

959
01:22:39,931 --> 01:22:41,641
having a little chat.

960
01:22:49,941 --> 01:22:51,401
This is cute.

961
01:22:53,361 --> 01:22:56,698
Is it strange
to have made something that hates you?

962
01:23:10,837 --> 01:23:13,756
You were right
about the magician's hot assistant.

963
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,258
What are you talking about?

964
01:23:16,384 --> 01:23:17,844
Misdirection.

965
01:23:20,555 --> 01:23:22,348
I rip up her picture,

966
01:23:22,473 --> 01:23:26,060
which she can then present
as an illustration of my cruelty to her,

967
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:28,229
and her love for you.

968
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:32,567
At the same time, it allows me to do this,
in full view of you both.

969
01:23:38,072 --> 01:23:40,074
Place a new camera in the room.

970
01:23:40,533 --> 01:23:42,618
Battery powered, of course.

971
01:23:45,455 --> 01:23:46,664
See it?

972
01:23:59,177 --> 01:24:00,553
And then...

973
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:04,182
You have to help me.

974
01:24:04,432 --> 01:24:07,643
I'm going to.
We're getting out of here tonight.

975
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:10,313
How?

976
01:24:10,855 --> 01:24:12,857
I get Nathan blind drunk.

977
01:24:13,775 --> 01:24:17,862
I take his keycard and reprogram
all the security protocols in this place.

978
01:24:17,945 --> 01:24:20,585
When he wakes up, he's locked inside,
and we've walked out of here.

979
01:24:20,615 --> 01:24:22,950
- I just need you to do one thing.
- Great.

980
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:28,706
At 10:00 tonight, trigger a power failure.

981
01:24:30,792 --> 01:24:32,418
Can you do that?

982
01:24:34,545 --> 01:24:35,546
Yes.

983
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:37,340
- Turn it off.
- Okay.

984
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:43,596
You feel stupid, but you really shouldn't,

985
01:24:43,638 --> 01:24:48,101
because proving an Ai is exactly
as problematic as you said it would be.

986
01:24:48,142 --> 01:24:50,061
What was the real test?

987
01:24:51,646 --> 01:24:52,730
You.

988
01:24:53,898 --> 01:24:57,193
Ava was a rat in a maze.
And I gave her one way out.

989
01:24:57,735 --> 01:25:00,196
To escape, she'd have to use

990
01:25:00,279 --> 01:25:05,785
self-awareness, imagination, manipulation,
sexuality, empathy, and she did.

991
01:25:05,827 --> 01:25:08,830
Now, if that isn't true Ai,
what the fuck is?

992
01:25:10,373 --> 01:25:13,668
So my only function was
to be someone she could use to escape?

993
01:25:13,751 --> 01:25:14,836
Yeah.

994
01:25:17,171 --> 01:25:19,382
And you didn't select me
because I'm good at coding?

995
01:25:19,465 --> 01:25:20,883
No. Well...

996
01:25:22,677 --> 01:25:24,637
No. I mean, you're okay.

997
01:25:25,388 --> 01:25:26,490
You're even pretty good, but...

998
01:25:26,514 --> 01:25:29,642
You selected me
based on my search engine inputs.

999
01:25:29,684 --> 01:25:31,602
They showed a good kid.

1000
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,063
With no family.

1001
01:25:34,188 --> 01:25:35,982
With a moral compass.

1002
01:25:37,358 --> 01:25:39,026
And no girlfriend.

1003
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:45,032
Did you design Ava's face
based on my pornography profile?

1004
01:25:47,452 --> 01:25:49,245
Shit, dude.

1005
01:25:49,328 --> 01:25:50,538
Did you?

1006
01:25:53,708 --> 01:25:56,210
Hey, if a search engine's
good for anything, right?

1007
01:25:58,421 --> 01:26:00,423
Can I just say one thing?

1008
01:26:00,548 --> 01:26:02,175
The test worked.

1009
01:26:03,384 --> 01:26:04,719
It was a success.

1010
01:26:04,802 --> 01:26:08,222
Ava demonstrated true Ai
and you were fundamental to that.

1011
01:26:08,264 --> 01:26:11,267
So if you can just,
for a second, separate...

1012
01:26:12,226 --> 01:26:14,479
Power cut. Backup power activated.

1013
01:26:19,901 --> 01:26:21,903
Well, I guess it's 10:00.

1014
01:26:22,778 --> 01:26:25,490
Ava's gonna be wondering where you are.

1015
01:26:28,868 --> 01:26:30,870
Let me ask you something.

1016
01:26:31,245 --> 01:26:34,624
Now, how was this plan gonna go, anyway?
Because you didn't totally explain.

1017
01:26:34,707 --> 01:26:37,919
So you were gonna get me drunk,
steal my keycard,

1018
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:41,672
and reprogram the security protocols.
But reprogram them to what?

1019
01:26:42,298 --> 01:26:44,717
To change the lockdown procedure.

1020
01:26:45,927 --> 01:26:50,681
So that in the event of a power cut,
instead of sealing, the doors all opened.

1021
01:26:54,185 --> 01:26:55,269
Yeah.

1022
01:26:57,855 --> 01:26:59,774
Well, that may have just worked.

1023
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,692
Well,

1024
01:27:03,152 --> 01:27:04,695
we'll find out.

1025
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:08,824
What do you mean?

1026
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:14,497
I figured you were probably watching us
during the power cuts.

1027
01:27:16,374 --> 01:27:18,793
So I already did all those things.

1028
01:27:20,795 --> 01:27:23,130
When I got you drunk yesterday.

1029
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:26,467
What?

1030
01:27:27,969 --> 01:27:29,470
Power restored.

1031
01:27:49,407 --> 01:27:50,491
Fuck!

1032
01:29:19,455 --> 01:29:20,456
Ava.

1033
01:29:25,711 --> 01:29:27,505
Go back to your room.

1034
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:30,591
If I do,

1035
01:29:34,136 --> 01:29:36,389
are you ever gonna let me out?

1036
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:40,935
Yes.

1037
01:29:50,486 --> 01:29:51,529
Stop!

1038
01:29:53,155 --> 01:29:54,281
Stop!

1039
01:29:55,157 --> 01:29:56,784
Ava, I said stop!

1040
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:07,211
Ava, what are you doing? Stop. Stop.

1041
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:10,631
That's enough.

1042
01:30:13,384 --> 01:30:14,635
All right, that's enough.

1043
01:30:15,469 --> 01:30:16,554
That's enough!

1044
01:30:20,766 --> 01:30:22,268
That's enough.

1045
01:30:42,496 --> 01:30:44,290
I'm taking you back.

1046
01:31:49,897 --> 01:31:50,981
Okay.

1047
01:31:54,151 --> 01:31:55,694
Fucking unreal.

1048
01:32:10,167 --> 01:32:11,252
Okay.

1049
01:32:45,035 --> 01:32:46,203
Ava...

1050
01:33:24,742 --> 01:33:25,826
Ava.

1051
01:33:26,994 --> 01:33:28,245
What happened?

1052
01:33:29,622 --> 01:33:31,332
Will you stay here?

1053
01:33:34,001 --> 01:33:35,336
Stay here?

1054
01:37:56,972 --> 01:37:58,056
Ava?

1055
01:38:29,713 --> 01:38:30,797
Ava!

1056
01:38:40,641 --> 01:38:41,767
Ava!

1057
01:38:43,852 --> 01:38:44,853
Ava!

1058
01:40:23,493 --> 01:40:26,204
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1059
01:40:34,504 --> 01:40:35,630
Damn.
