1
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:52,357
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mom.

2
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:57,571
You feeling any better?

3
00:00:57,654 --> 00:00:59,573
A little bit.

4
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:02,242
- Guess what.
- What?

5
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,578
Your grandfather's here.

6
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:07,205
Mom, can't you tell him I'm sick?

7
00:01:07,998 --> 00:01:11,042
You're sick. That's why he's here.

8
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:12,711
He'll pinch my cheek.

9
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:14,337
I hate that.

10
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:16,131
Maybe he won't.

11
00:01:16,757 --> 00:01:19,634
Hey! How is the sickie?

12
00:01:19,718 --> 00:01:21,094
Huh?

13
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:26,600
I think I'll leave you two pals alone.

14
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:29,019
I brought ya a special present.

15
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:30,812
- What is it?
- Open it up.

16
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:38,361
- A book?
- That's right.

17
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:41,656
When I was your age,
television was called books.

18
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,950
And this is a special book.

19
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:47,329
It was the book my father
used to read to me when I was sick,

20
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:49,998
and I used to read it to your father.

21
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:52,209
And today, I'm gonna read it to you.

22
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:55,796
- Does it got any sports in it?
- Are you kidding?

23
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:59,758
Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge,

24
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:03,678
giants, monsters, chases, escapes,

25
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:06,306
true love, miracles.

26
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:08,225
Doesn't sound too bad.

27
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,727
- I'll try and stay awake.
- Oh.

28
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:14,189
Well, thank you very much.
That's very nice of you.

29
00:02:14,272 --> 00:02:16,691
Your vote of confidence is overwhelming.

30
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:18,860
All right.

31
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:21,696
<i>The Princess Bride...</i>

32
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:25,492
by S. Morgenstern.

33
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:26,785
Chapter one.

34
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:32,541
"Buttercup was raised on a small farm
in the country of Florin.

35
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:35,335
Her favorite pastimes
were riding her horse

36
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:38,171
<i>and tormenting the farm boy
that worked there.</i>

37
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:42,509
<i>His name was Westley,
but she never called him that."</i>

38
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:44,636
<i>Isn't that a wonderful beginning?</i>

39
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:48,181
<i>Yeah, it's really good.</i>

40
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:52,185
<i>"Nothing gave Buttercup
as much pleasure as ordering Westley around."</i>

41
00:02:52,894 --> 00:02:55,897
Farm boy, polish my horse's saddle.

42
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,859
I want to see my face
shining in it by morning.

43
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:00,694
As you wish.

44
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:07,158
<i>"'As you wish' was all he ever said to her."</i>

45
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:12,414
Farm boy, fill these with water.

46
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,959
Please?

47
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:18,378
As you wish.

48
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:24,759
<i>"That day, she was amazed to discover</i>

49
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:26,761
<i>that when he was saying 'as you wish, '</i>

50
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:28,930
<i>what he meant was 'I love you. '</i>

51
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:36,563
<i>And even more amazing was the day
she realized she truly loved him back."</i>

52
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:39,232
Farm boy.

53
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:47,532
Fetch me that pitcher?

54
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:04,090
As you wish.

55
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:15,977
<i>Hold it. Hold it.</i>

56
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:18,897
What is this?
Are you tryin' to trick me?

57
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,899
Wh-Where's the sports?

58
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:23,777
Is this a kissing book?

59
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,570
Wait. Just wait.

60
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:27,405
Well, when does it get good?

61
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:30,033
All right, keep your shirt on. Let me read.

62
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:33,203
"Westley had no money for marriage,

63
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:35,747
so he packed his few belongings
and left the farm

64
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,666
to seek his fortune across the sea.

65
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:41,044
<i>It was a very emotional time
for Buttercup."</i>

66
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,797
<i>I don't believe this.</i>

67
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:46,883
I fear I'll never see you again.

68
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:49,010
Of course you will.

69
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:52,263
But what if something happens to you?

70
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,227
Hear this now.

71
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:00,814
I will always come for you.

72
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,317
But how can you be sure?

73
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:06,528
This is true love.

74
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,824
Think this happens every day?

75
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:24,921
<i>"Westley didn't reach his destination.</i>

76
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:28,258
<i>His ship was attacked
by the Dread Pirate Roberts,</i>

77
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:30,760
<i>who never left captives alive.</i>

78
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:33,638
<i>When Buttercup got the news
that Westley was murdered â€’"</i>

79
00:05:33,722 --> 00:05:35,515
<i>Murdered by pirates is good.</i>

80
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:37,976
<i>"she went into her room
and shut the door.</i>

81
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:40,812
<i>And for days, she neither slept nor ate."</i>

82
00:05:41,813 --> 00:05:43,815
I will never love again.

83
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:52,449
<i>"Five years later,
the main square of Florin City</i>

84
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:54,284
<i>was filled as never before</i>

85
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:58,371
<i>to hear the announcement of
the great Prince Humperdinck's bride-to-be."</i>

86
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:09,758
My people,

87
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:11,968
a month from now,

88
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:15,972
our country will have
its 500th anniversary.

89
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:20,143
On that sundown,
I shall marry a lady

90
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:23,772
who was once
a commoner like yourselves.

91
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:25,398
But perhaps

92
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:29,569
you will not find her common now.

93
00:06:29,652 --> 00:06:33,323
- Would you like to meet her?
- Yes!

94
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:35,033
My people,

95
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:39,621
the princess Buttercup!

96
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:04,020
<i>"Buttercup's emptiness consumed her.</i>

97
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:07,690
<i>Although the law of the land gave Humperdinck
the right to choose his bride,</i>

98
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,527
<i>she did not love him.</i>

99
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:19,285
<i>Despite Humperdinck's reassurance
that she would grow to love him,</i>

100
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:22,997
<i>the only joy she found
was in her daily ride."</i>

101
00:07:34,092 --> 00:07:36,761
A word, my lady?

102
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:41,724
We are but poor, lost circus performers.

103
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:44,310
Is there a village nearby?

104
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:47,605
There is nothing nearby, not for miles.

105
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:51,192
Then there will be
no one to hear you scream.

106
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,160
What is that you're ripping?

107
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:02,996
It's fabric from the uniform
of an army officer of Guilder.

108
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,747
Who is Guilder?

109
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:08,418
The country across the sea.
The sworn enemy of Florin.

110
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,211
Go!

111
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:12,213
Once the horse reaches the castle,

112
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:16,551
the fabric will make the prince suspect
that the Guilderians have abducted his love.

113
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:19,179
When he finds her body dead
on the Guilder frontier,

114
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:21,764
his suspicions will be totally confirmed.

115
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:24,350
You never said anything
about killing anyone.

116
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:27,270
I've hired you to help me start a war.

117
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:31,941
It's a prestigious line of work
with a long and glorious tradition.

118
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:35,111
I just don't think it's right,
killing an innocent girl.

119
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:40,366
Am I going mad,
or did the word "think" escape your lips?

120
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,204
You were not hired for your brains,
you hippopotamic landmass!

121
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,663
I agree with Fezzik.

122
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:48,750
Oh, the sot has spoken.

123
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,127
What happens to her
is not truly your concern.

124
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:52,629
<i>I</i> will kill her.

125
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:54,672
And remember this. Never forget this!

126
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:59,802
When I found you, you were so slobbering drunk
you couldn't buy brandy!

127
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:01,596
And you!

128
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,765
Friendless. Brainless.

129
00:09:03,848 --> 00:09:05,892
Helpless! Hopeless!

130
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:09,437
Do you want me to send you back
to where you were?

131
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,440
Unemployed in Greenland?

132
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:29,999
That Vizzini, he can fuss.

133
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,335
"Fuss." "Fuss."

134
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:35,213
I think he like to scream at us.

135
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:38,508
Probably he means no <i>harm.</i>

136
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:43,596
He's very, very short on charm.

137
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,724
You have a great gift for rhyme.

138
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:50,728
- Yes. Yes. Some of the time.
- Enough of that!

139
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:53,481
Fezzik, are there rocks ahead?

140
00:09:53,564 --> 00:09:56,109
If there are, we all be dead.

141
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:58,486
No more rhymes! Now, I mean it!

142
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:01,364
Anybody want a peanut?

143
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:11,791
We'll reach the cliffs by dawn.

144
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:17,797
- Why are you doing that?
- Making sure nobody's follow us.

145
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,258
That would be inconceivable.

146
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:23,594
Despite what you think,
you will be caught.

147
00:10:23,678 --> 00:10:26,889
And when you are,
the prince will see you all hanged.

148
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:29,767
Of all the necks on this boat, Highness,

149
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:32,395
the one you should be
worrying about is your own.

150
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:41,029
Stop doing that!
We can all relax. It's almost over.

151
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:43,698
- You are sure nobody's follow us?
- As I told you,

152
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:48,202
it would be absolutely, totally
and in all other ways inconceivable.

153
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:50,204
No one in Guilder knows what we've done.

154
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:53,291
And no one in Florin
could've gotten here so fast.

155
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:58,254
Out of curiosity, why do you ask?

156
00:10:58,338 --> 00:11:02,550
No reason. Suddenly, I just happened
to look behind us and something is there.

157
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,093
What?

158
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:15,063
Probably some local fisherman
out for a pleasure cruise at night

159
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:17,982
through eel-infested waters.

160
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:22,487
What? Go in! Get after her!

161
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,238
I don't swim.

162
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:26,074
I only dog paddle.

163
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:29,786
Veer left!

164
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,916
Left! Left!

165
00:11:42,507 --> 00:11:45,468
Do you know
what that sound is, Highness?

166
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:48,137
Those are the shrieking eels!

167
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:50,681
If you don't believe me, just wait.

168
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:55,937
They always grow louder
when they're about to feed on human flesh!

169
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:04,153
If you swim back now, I promise,
no harm will come to you.

170
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:07,532
I doubt you'll get such an offer
from the eels.

171
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,669
She doesn't get eaten
by the eels at this time.

172
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:23,089
- What?
- The eel doesn't get her.

173
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:25,967
I'm explaining to you
because you look nervous.

174
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,845
Uh... I wasn't nervous.

175
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:34,725
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned,
but that's not the same thing.

176
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,186
Because we can stop now if you want.

177
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,982
No, you could read a little bit more,
if you want.

178
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:42,275
Mmm.

179
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,403
"Do you know what
that sound is, Highness?

180
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:47,780
<i>Those are the shrieking eels."</i>

181
00:12:47,864 --> 00:12:50,283
We're past that, Grandpa.
You read it already.

182
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:55,788
Oh â€’ Oh, my goodness. I did.
I'm sorry. Beg your pardon.

183
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:57,874
<i>All right, all right. Let's see.</i>

184
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:00,376
<i>She was in the water.
The eel was comin' after her.</i>

185
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,838
<i>She was frightened.
The eel started to charge her, and then â€’</i>

186
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:09,051
Put her down. Just put her down.

187
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:15,266
I think he's getting closer.

188
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:18,311
He's no concern of ours! Sail on!

189
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:21,355
I suppose you think you're brave, don't you?

190
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:23,983
Only compared to some.

191
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:32,533
Look! He's right on top of us!

192
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:35,369
I wonder if he is using
the same wind we are using.

193
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:38,956
Whoever he is, he's too late. See?

194
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,461
The Cliffs of Insanity!

195
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:45,671
Hurry up!

196
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,423
Move the thing!

197
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:50,259
And that other thing!

198
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:52,678
Move it!

199
00:13:57,808 --> 00:14:00,937
We're safe. Only Fezzik
is strong enough to go up our way.

200
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,898
<i>He'll</i> have to sail around for hours
till he finds a harbor.

201
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,656
He's climbing the rope,
and he's gaining on us.

202
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:55,324
Inconceivable.

203
00:14:57,994 --> 00:15:00,955
- Faster!
- I thought I <i>was</i> going faster.

204
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:03,207
You were supposed to be
this colossus.

205
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,711
You were this great, legendary thing!
And yet he gains!

206
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:10,631
Well, I'm carrying three people,
and he got only himself.

207
00:15:10,715 --> 00:15:14,343
I do not accept excuses. I'm just going to
have to find myself a new giant, that's all.

208
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:17,096
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please?

209
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:26,314
Did I make it clear
that your job is at stake?

210
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:29,085
He's got very good arms.

211
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:34,173
He didn't fall? Inconceivable.

212
00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:38,803
You keep using that word. I do not think
it means what you think it means.

213
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:43,891
My God. He's climbing.

214
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:47,937
Whoever he is, he's obviously seen us
with the princess and must therefore die.

215
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,107
You, carry her.
We'll head straight for the Guilder frontier.

216
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,069
Catch up when he's dead.
If he falls, fine. If not, the sword.

217
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:57,488
I'm going to duel him left-handed.

218
00:16:57,571 --> 00:16:59,490
You know what a hurry we're in!

219
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:01,659
It's the only way I can be satisfied.

220
00:17:01,742 --> 00:17:06,455
- If I use my right, over too quickly.
- Oh, have it your way.

221
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:17,007
You be careful.
People in masks cannot be trusted.

222
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:20,302
I'm waiting!

223
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:34,442
Hello there!

224
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:39,697
Slow going?

225
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:43,784
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but this is not as easy as it looks,

226
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:46,537
so I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't distract me.

227
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,038
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

228
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:00,384
I do not suppose
you could speed things up?

229
00:18:00,468 --> 00:18:04,388
If you're in such a hurry,
you could lower a rope or a tree branch

230
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:06,557
or find something useful to do.

231
00:18:07,391 --> 00:18:11,061
I could do that.
I think I've got some rope up here.

232
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:13,063
But I do not think
you would accept my help

233
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:15,316
since I am only
waiting around to kill you.

234
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:18,569
That does put a damper
on our relationship.

235
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:23,115
But I promise I will not kill you
until you reach the top.

236
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:27,244
That's very comforting,
but I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.

237
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:28,788
I hate waiting.

238
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:32,166
I could give you my word as a Spaniard.

239
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:35,753
No good.
I've known too many Spaniards.

240
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:37,922
Is there any way you'll trust me?

241
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:40,049
Nothing comes to mind.

242
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:43,761
I swear on the soul of my father,
Domingo Montoya.

243
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,764
You will reach the top alive.

244
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:48,933
Throw me the rope.

245
00:19:18,546 --> 00:19:20,464
Thank you.

246
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:22,967
W-W-We'll wait until you're ready.

247
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:25,886
Again, thank you.

248
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:41,610
I do not mean to pry,

249
00:19:41,694 --> 00:19:45,406
but you don't, by any chance, happen
to have six fingers on your right hand?

250
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:49,243
Do you always
begin conversations this way?

251
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,913
My father was slaughtered
by a six-fingered man.

252
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:01,839
He was a great sword maker, my father.

253
00:20:01,922 --> 00:20:04,466
When the six-fingered man appear
and request a special sword,

254
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,302
my father took the job.

255
00:20:07,928 --> 00:20:10,306
He slave a year before he was done.

256
00:20:20,524 --> 00:20:22,192
I've never seen its equal.

257
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:27,072
The six-fingered man
returned and demanded it,

258
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:30,409
but at one-tenth his promised price.

259
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:32,703
My father refuse.

260
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:36,707
Without a word, the six-fingered man
slash him through the heart.

261
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,710
I love my father.

262
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:43,422
So naturally,
I challenge his murderer to a duel.

263
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,258
I fail.

264
00:20:47,635 --> 00:20:50,346
Six-fingered man leave me alive.

265
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:53,515
But he gave me this.

266
00:20:55,893 --> 00:20:59,229
- How old were you?
- I was 11 years old.

267
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,524
When I was strong enough,

268
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:06,654
I dedicate my life to the study of fencing.

269
00:21:06,737 --> 00:21:11,033
So the next time we meet,
I will not fail.

270
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:15,955
I will go up to
the six-fingered man and say,

271
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:17,998
"Hello.

272
00:21:18,082 --> 00:21:20,167
My name is Inigo Montoya.

273
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:23,545
You killed my father.

274
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:25,881
Prepare to die."

275
00:21:27,174 --> 00:21:29,343
You've done nothing but study swordplay?

276
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,554
More pursue it than study lately.

277
00:21:33,263 --> 00:21:35,224
You see, I cannot find him.

278
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:38,435
It's been 20 years now.
I am starting to lose confidence.

279
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:42,815
I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills.
Not a lot of money in revenge.

280
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,945
Well, I â€’ I certainly hope
you find him someday.

281
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,990
- You are ready then?
- Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair.

282
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:54,451
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to kill you.

283
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:57,371
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to die.

284
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:00,124
Begin.

285
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:34,783
You are using Bonetti's defense
against me, huh?

286
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:38,787
- I thought it fitting considering the rocky terrain.
- Naturally.

287
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:41,582
- You must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
- Naturally.

288
00:22:41,665 --> 00:22:44,710
But I find Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro.
Don't you?

289
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:48,380
Unless the enemy has study his Agrippa.

290
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,550
Which I have.

291
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,724
- You are wonderful.
- Thank you.

292
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:02,352
- I've worked hard to become so.
- I admit that you are better than I am.

293
00:23:02,436 --> 00:23:05,814
- Then why are you smiling?
- Because I know something you don't know.

294
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:09,735
- And what is that?
- I am not left-handed.

295
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:23,791
- You are amazing.
- I ought to be after 20 years.

296
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:27,294
- There's something I ought to tell you.
- Tell me.

297
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:29,880
I'm not left-handed either.

298
00:23:56,323 --> 00:23:57,658
Who are you?

299
00:23:57,741 --> 00:23:59,284
No one of consequence.

300
00:23:59,368 --> 00:24:00,869
I must know.

301
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:02,621
Get used to disappointment.

302
00:24:02,704 --> 00:24:04,289
Okay.

303
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:49,042
Kill me quickly.

304
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:52,546
I would as soon destroy a stained-glass window
as an artist like yourself.

305
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:55,716
However, since I can't have you
following me either â€’

306
00:24:59,303 --> 00:25:02,639
Please understand
I hold you in the highest respect.

307
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,485
Inconceivable!

308
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:18,280
Give her to me.
Catch up with us quickly.

309
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:20,032
- What do I do?
- Finish him.

310
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:21,742
Finish him your way!

311
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:24,369
Oh, good. My way.
Thank you, Vizzini.

312
00:25:25,621 --> 00:25:26,997
Which way is my way?

313
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:30,584
Pick up one of those rocks.
Get behind the boulder.

314
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:33,712
In a few minutes, the man in black
will come running around the bend.

315
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:37,466
The minute his head is in view,
hit it with the rock!

316
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:42,054
My way is not very sportsmanlike.

317
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:14,711
I did that on purpose.
I didn't have to miss.

318
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:16,338
I believe you.

319
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:19,383
So what happens now?

320
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:22,010
We face each other as God intended.

321
00:26:22,094 --> 00:26:25,931
Sportsmanlike.
No tricks. No weapons.

322
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:27,516
Skill against skill alone.

323
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,061
You mean, you'll put down your rock
and I'll put down my sword

324
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:33,647
and we'll try and kill each other
like civilized people?

325
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:36,108
I could kill you now.

326
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:37,484
Frankly...

327
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,571
I think the odds are slightly in your favor
at hand fighting.

328
00:26:41,655 --> 00:26:45,033
It's not my fault
being the biggest and the strongest.

329
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:46,952
I don't even exercise.

330
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:09,391
Look, are you just fiddling around
with me or what?

331
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:11,977
I just want you to feel you are doing well.

332
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,937
I hate for people to die embarrassed.

333
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:17,566
You're quick.

334
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:20,235
- And a good thing too.
- Why do you wear a mask?

335
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,696
Were you burned by acid or something like that?

336
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:24,531
Oh, no, it's just they're
terribly comfortable.

337
00:27:24,614 --> 00:27:26,742
I think everyone will be
wearing them in the future.

338
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:33,790
I just figured why
you give me so much trouble.

339
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:38,628
Why is that, do you think?

340
00:27:38,712 --> 00:27:42,090
Well, I haven't fought just one person...

341
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:44,509
for so long.

342
00:27:45,385 --> 00:27:47,763
Been specializing in groups,

343
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:50,682
battling gangs for local charities.

344
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:52,184
That kind of thing.

345
00:27:54,144 --> 00:27:57,230
Why should that make
such a â€’ difference?

346
00:27:57,314 --> 00:27:58,440
Well, you see,

347
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:00,525
you use different moves

348
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:02,277
when you're fighting...

349
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:04,821
half a dozen... people...

350
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:07,449
than when you only...

351
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:10,535
have to be worried... about one.

352
00:28:23,757 --> 00:28:26,927
I do not envy you the headache
you will have when you awake.

353
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:31,014
But in the meantime,
rest well and dream of large women.

354
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:52,911
There was a mighty duel.

355
00:28:55,455 --> 00:28:57,624
It ranged all over.

356
00:28:57,707 --> 00:28:59,709
They were both masters.

357
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:02,129
Who won? How did it end?

358
00:29:02,754 --> 00:29:05,674
The loser ran off alone,

359
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:08,468
but the winner...

360
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:13,181
followed those footprints toward Guilder.

361
00:29:13,265 --> 00:29:14,724
Shall we track them both?

362
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:18,854
The loser is nothing.
Only the princess matters.

363
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:22,607
Clearly this was all planned
by warriors of Guilder.

364
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:25,569
We must all be ready
for whatever lies ahead.

365
00:29:26,153 --> 00:29:27,404
Could this be a trap?

366
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:32,033
I always think everything could be a trap,
which is why I'm still alive.

367
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:46,965
So, it is down to you,
and it is down to me.

368
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,221
If you wish her dead,
by all means keep moving forward.

369
00:29:55,015 --> 00:29:57,642
- Let me explain.
- There's nothing to explain.

370
00:29:57,726 --> 00:30:00,479
You're trying to kidnap
what I've rightfully stolen.

371
00:30:00,562 --> 00:30:03,398
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached?

372
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:05,484
There will be no arrangement.

373
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:07,194
And you're killing her.

374
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:13,450
Well, if there can be no arrangement,
then we are at an impasse.

375
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,285
I'm afraid so.

376
00:30:15,368 --> 00:30:17,704
I can't compete with you physically,

377
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:19,956
and you're no match for my brains.

378
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,167
- You're that smart?
- Let me put it this way.

379
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:26,046
Have you ever heard of Plato?
Aristotle? Socrates?

380
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:27,631
- Yes.
- Morons.

381
00:30:27,714 --> 00:30:29,007
Really?

382
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:32,552
In that case,
I challenge you to a battle of wits.

383
00:30:32,636 --> 00:30:33,929
For the princess?

384
00:30:35,138 --> 00:30:36,348
To the death?

385
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:39,059
I accept.

386
00:30:39,142 --> 00:30:40,977
Good. Then pour the wine.

387
00:30:56,785 --> 00:30:58,912
Inhale this, but do not touch.

388
00:31:00,247 --> 00:31:02,541
I smell nothing.

389
00:31:02,624 --> 00:31:05,043
What you do not smell
is called iocane powder.

390
00:31:05,126 --> 00:31:07,546
It is odorless, tasteless,
dissolves instantly in liquid,

391
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:10,006
and is among the more deadly poisons
known to man.

392
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,091
Hmm.

393
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,199
All right. Where is the poison?

394
00:31:36,283 --> 00:31:37,867
The battle of wits has begun.

395
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:39,911
It ends when you decide
and we both drink

396
00:31:39,995 --> 00:31:43,873
and find out who is right
and who is dead.

397
00:31:43,957 --> 00:31:46,209
But it's so simple.

398
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:49,546
All I have to do is
divine from what I know of you.

399
00:31:49,629 --> 00:31:54,217
Are you the sort of man who would put the poison
into his own goblet or his enemy's?

400
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:57,178
Now, a clever man would put the poison
into his own goblet

401
00:31:57,262 --> 00:32:00,432
because he would know that only a great fool
would reach for what he was given.

402
00:32:00,515 --> 00:32:04,811
I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not
choose the wine in front of you.

403
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:07,355
But you must have known
I was not a great fool.

404
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:11,693
You would've counted on it. So I can clearly
not choose the wine in front of me.

405
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,487
- You've made your decision then?
- Not remotely.

406
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:17,949
Because iocane comes from Australia,
as everyone knows.

407
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:20,410
And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals.

408
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:24,539
And criminals are used to having people
not trust them, as you are not trusted by me.

409
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:27,083
So I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

410
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:29,252
Truly you have a dizzying intellect.

411
00:32:29,336 --> 00:32:31,421
Wait till I get going!

412
00:32:31,504 --> 00:32:33,256
- Where was I?
- Australia.

413
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,177
Yes. Australia. And you must have suspected
I would've known the powder's origin.

414
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,554
So I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

415
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:43,433
- You're just stalling now.
- You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?

416
00:32:43,516 --> 00:32:46,436
You've beaten my giant,
which means you're exceptionally strong.

417
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:50,190
So you could've put the poison in your own goblet,
trusting on your strength to save you,

418
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:52,984
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

419
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:56,738
But you've also bested my Spaniard,
which means you must've studied.

420
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:59,824
And in studying, you must've
learned that man is mortal.

421
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:03,203
So you would've put the poison
as far from yourself as possible,

422
00:33:03,286 --> 00:33:06,039
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

423
00:33:06,122 --> 00:33:09,167
You're trying to trick me into
giving away something. It won't work.

424
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,088
It <i>has</i> worked! You've given everything away!
I know where the poison is!

425
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,590
- Then make your choice.
- I will, and I choose â€’

426
00:33:15,674 --> 00:33:17,634
What in the world can that be?

427
00:33:17,717 --> 00:33:19,010
What? Where?

428
00:33:20,762 --> 00:33:22,222
I don't see anything.

429
00:33:22,305 --> 00:33:26,101
Well, I-I could've sworn I saw something.
No matter. Hmm.

430
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:31,815
- What's so funny?
- I-I'll tell you in a minute.

431
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:33,650
First, let's drink.

432
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:36,486
Me from my glass,
and you from yours.

433
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:53,837
- You guessed wrong.
- You only think I guessed wrong.

434
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,090
That's what's so funny!
I switched glasses when your back was turned!

435
00:33:57,173 --> 00:33:58,591
You fool!

436
00:33:58,675 --> 00:34:01,177
You fell victim
to one of the classic blunders.

437
00:34:01,261 --> 00:34:04,305
The most famous is
never get involved in a land war in Asia.

438
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:07,350
But only slightly less well known is this:

439
00:34:07,434 --> 00:34:11,521
never go in against a Sicilian
when death is on the line!

440
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:29,622
- Who are you?
- I am no one to be trifled with.

441
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:32,167
That is all you ever need know.

442
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,754
To think, all that time
it was your cup that was poisoned.

443
00:34:35,837 --> 00:34:37,255
They were both poisoned.

444
00:34:38,673 --> 00:34:41,968
I spent the last few years building up
an immunity to iocane powder.

445
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:47,682
Someone has beaten the giant.

446
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:53,480
There will be great suffering in Guilder
if she dies.

447
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:09,746
Catch your breath.

448
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:14,292
If you'll release me, whatever you ask
for ransom you'll get it. I promise you.

449
00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:19,339
And what is that worth,
the promise of a woman?

450
00:35:19,422 --> 00:35:20,840
You're very funny, Highness.

451
00:35:21,341 --> 00:35:25,136
I was giving you a chance.
It does not matter where you take me.

452
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,555
There's no greater hunter
than Prince Humperdinck.

453
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:30,892
He can track a falcon on a cloudy day.
He can find you.

454
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:34,604
- You think your dearest love will save you?
- I never said he was my dearest love.

455
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:36,940
And yes, he will save me.
That I know.

456
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:40,568
You admit to me you do not love your fiancÃ©.

457
00:35:40,652 --> 00:35:42,278
He knows I do not love him.

458
00:35:42,362 --> 00:35:44,489
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.

459
00:35:46,866 --> 00:35:50,745
I have loved more deeply
than a killer like yourself could ever dream â€’

460
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,377
That was a warning, Highness.
The next time, my hand flies on its own.

461
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,296
For where I come from,
there are penalties when a woman lies.

462
00:36:06,553 --> 00:36:08,805
Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.

463
00:36:09,973 --> 00:36:12,267
And there are the princess's footprints.

464
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,061
She is alive, or was an hour ago.

465
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:18,231
If she is otherwise when I find her,

466
00:36:18,314 --> 00:36:20,608
I shall be very put out.

467
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:29,200
- Rest, Highness.
- I know who you are.

468
00:36:29,284 --> 00:36:31,452
Your cruelty reveals everything.

469
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:33,663
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts.
Admit it.

470
00:36:33,746 --> 00:36:37,166
With pride. What can I do for you?

471
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,169
You can die slowly,
cut into a thousand pieces.

472
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:44,132
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness.

473
00:36:44,215 --> 00:36:45,800
Why loose your venom on me?

474
00:36:46,843 --> 00:36:48,845
You killed my love.

475
00:36:48,928 --> 00:36:50,388
It's possible.

476
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,557
I kill a lot of people.

477
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:57,437
Who was this love of yours?
Another prince like this one?

478
00:36:58,521 --> 00:37:00,565
Ugly and rich and scabby?

479
00:37:00,648 --> 00:37:03,943
No. A farm boy. Poor.

480
00:37:04,027 --> 00:37:05,862
Poor and perfect,

481
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,699
with eyes like the sea after a storm.

482
00:37:13,328 --> 00:37:17,248
On the high seas your ship attacked.
The Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.

483
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:19,250
I can't afford to make exceptions.

484
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:22,295
Once word leaks out a pirate has gone soft,
people begin to disobey you,

485
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:24,714
and then it's nothing
but work, work, work all the time.

486
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:26,174
You mock my pain!

487
00:37:26,257 --> 00:37:28,760
Life is pain, Highness.

488
00:37:28,843 --> 00:37:31,054
Anyone who says differently
is selling something.

489
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:37,769
I remember this farm boy of yours, I think.

490
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,189
This would be what? Five years ago?

491
00:37:42,273 --> 00:37:44,609
Does it bother you to hear?

492
00:37:44,692 --> 00:37:47,403
Nothing you can say will upset me.

493
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:49,072
He died well.

494
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:51,199
That should please you.

495
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:53,409
No bribe attempts or blubbering.

496
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:56,746
He simply said, "Please.

497
00:37:57,914 --> 00:38:00,208
Please, I need to live."

498
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:03,711
It was the "please"
that caught my memory.

499
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:05,838
I asked him what was
so important for him.

500
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:08,091
"True love," he replied.

501
00:38:11,427 --> 00:38:14,973
And then he spoke of a girl
of surpassing beauty and faithfulness.

502
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:17,600
I can only assume he meant you.

503
00:38:17,684 --> 00:38:22,105
You should bless me for destroying him
before he found out what you really are.

504
00:38:22,188 --> 00:38:23,481
And what am I?

505
00:38:23,564 --> 00:38:26,234
Faithfulness he talked of, madam,
your enduring faithfulness.

506
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:27,318
Now tell me truly.

507
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:29,654
When you found out he was gone, did you
get engaged to your prince that same hour,

508
00:38:29,737 --> 00:38:31,864
or did you wait a whole week
out of respect for the dead?

509
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:34,617
You mocked me once!
Never do it again!

510
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:36,119
I died that day!

511
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:42,208
And you can die too, for all I care!

512
00:38:44,085 --> 00:38:48,089
As you wish!

513
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:51,592
Oh, my sweet Westley.
What have I done?

514
00:39:05,773 --> 00:39:07,775
Ow! Ow! Ooh!

515
00:39:11,029 --> 00:39:13,239
They disappeared.

516
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:17,118
He must've seen us closing in,
which might account for his panicking into error.

517
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:20,246
Unless I am wrong,
and I am never wrong,

518
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:23,750
they are headed
dead into the Fire Swamp.

519
00:39:35,428 --> 00:39:38,014
- Can you move at all?
- Move?

520
00:39:38,097 --> 00:39:41,768
You're alive.
If you want, I can fly.

521
00:39:46,856 --> 00:39:51,569
I told you I would always come for you.
Why didn't you wait for me?

522
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:55,031
Well, you were dead.

523
00:39:55,114 --> 00:39:57,241
Death cannot stop true love.

524
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:01,370
All it can do is delay it for a while.

525
00:40:02,914 --> 00:40:04,999
I will never doubt again.

526
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:08,377
There will never be a need.

527
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,800
<i>Oh, no. No, please.</i>

528
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:15,968
What is it? What's the matter?

529
00:40:16,052 --> 00:40:18,096
They're kissing again.

530
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:20,556
Do we have to hear the kissing part?

531
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,017
Someday you may not mind so much.

532
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:24,644
Skip on to the Fire Swamp.

533
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:26,395
- That sounded good.
- Oh.

534
00:40:27,814 --> 00:40:29,524
You're sick. I'll humor ya.

535
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:36,030
So now, where were we here?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah, okay.

536
00:40:36,114 --> 00:40:41,077
<i>"Westley and Buttercup
raced along the ravine floor."</i>

537
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,787
Ha!

538
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,497
Your pig fiancÃ© is too late.

539
00:40:46,457 --> 00:40:49,335
A few more steps
and we'll be safe in the Fire Swamp.

540
00:40:50,336 --> 00:40:51,712
We'll never survive.

541
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:55,007
Nonsense. You're only saying that
because no one ever has.

542
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:24,036
It's not that bad.

543
00:41:26,873 --> 00:41:30,710
I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here,
but the trees are actually quite lovely.

544
00:42:09,165 --> 00:42:11,542
Well, now, that was an adventure.

545
00:42:11,626 --> 00:42:14,879
- Singed a bit, were you?
- You?

546
00:42:22,428 --> 00:42:24,472
Well, one thing I will say.

547
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:27,183
Fire Swamp certainly does
keep you on your toes.

548
00:42:33,773 --> 00:42:36,359
This will all soon be but a happy memory,

549
00:42:36,442 --> 00:42:39,195
because Roberts' ship, <i>Revenge,</i>
is anchored at the far end.

550
00:42:39,278 --> 00:42:41,489
And I, as you know, am Roberts.

551
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:44,325
But how is that possible
since he's been marauding 20 years

552
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:46,535
and you only left me five years ago?

553
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,580
I, myself, am often surprised
at life's little quirks.

554
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:55,169
See, what I told you before
about saying "please" was true.

555
00:42:56,796 --> 00:43:00,091
It intrigued Roberts,
as did my descriptions of your beauty.

556
00:43:01,175 --> 00:43:03,219
Finally Roberts decided something.

557
00:43:03,302 --> 00:43:05,471
He said, "All right, Westley.

558
00:43:05,554 --> 00:43:08,349
I've never had a valet.
You can try it for tonight.

559
00:43:08,432 --> 00:43:10,309
I'll most likely kill you in the morning."

560
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:12,937
Three years he said that.

561
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,855
"Good night, Westley. Good work.

562
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:17,525
Sleep well. I'll most likely
kill you in the morning."

563
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:20,236
It was a fine time for me.
I was learning to fence, to fight,

564
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,196
anything anyone would teach me.

565
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,782
And Roberts and I
eventually became friends.

566
00:43:24,865 --> 00:43:26,909
- And then it happened.
- What?

567
00:43:28,077 --> 00:43:29,245
Go on.

568
00:43:29,328 --> 00:43:31,747
Well, Roberts had grown so rich
he wanted to retire,

569
00:43:31,831 --> 00:43:34,834
so he took me to his cabin
and told me his secret.

570
00:43:37,378 --> 00:43:39,588
"I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts,"
he said.

571
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:41,090
"My name is Ryan.

572
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:44,010
I inherited the ship
from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts,

573
00:43:44,093 --> 00:43:46,012
just as you will inherit it from me.

574
00:43:46,095 --> 00:43:48,931
The man I inherited it from was not
the real Dread Pirate Roberts either.

575
00:43:49,015 --> 00:43:51,142
His name was Cumberbund.

576
00:43:51,225 --> 00:43:54,562
The real Roberts has been retired 15 years
and living like a king in Patagonia."

577
00:43:54,645 --> 00:43:55,646
Thank you.

578
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,315
Then he explained the name

579
00:43:57,398 --> 00:44:00,401
was the important thing
for inspiring the necessary fear.

580
00:44:00,484 --> 00:44:04,238
You see, no one would surrender
to the Dread Pirate Westley.

581
00:44:05,406 --> 00:44:07,950
So we sailed ashore,
took on an entirely new crew,

582
00:44:08,034 --> 00:44:12,538
and he stayed aboard for a while as first mate,
all the time calling me Roberts.

583
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:15,958
Once the crew believed, he left the ship
and I have been Roberts ever since.

584
00:44:16,959 --> 00:44:20,838
Except now that we're together, I shall retire
and hand the name over to someone else.

585
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:22,798
Is everything clear to you?

586
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:58,269
We'll never succeed.

587
00:45:58,352 --> 00:46:00,563
We may as well die here.

588
00:46:02,356 --> 00:46:06,444
No. No. We have already succeeded.

589
00:46:07,945 --> 00:46:11,991
I mean, what are the three terrors
of the Fire Swamp?

590
00:46:12,074 --> 00:46:14,827
One, the flame spurt. No problem.

591
00:46:15,411 --> 00:46:18,289
There's a popping sound preceding each.
We can avoid that.

592
00:46:18,372 --> 00:46:22,418
Two, the lightning sand. But you were
clever enough to discover what that looks like.

593
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:24,420
So in the future we can avoid that too.

594
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:26,964
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?

595
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:30,301
Rodents of Unusual Size?
I don't think they exist.

596
00:47:07,046 --> 00:47:08,088
Westley!

597
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:23,747
We did it.

598
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:27,501
Now, was that so terrible?

599
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:40,180
Surrender!

600
00:48:40,264 --> 00:48:43,309
You mean you wish to surrender to me?
Very well. I accept.

601
00:48:43,392 --> 00:48:47,813
I give you full marks for bravery.
Don't make yourself a fool.

602
00:48:47,896 --> 00:48:51,275
Ah, but how will you capture us?
We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp.

603
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:54,987
We can live there quite happily for some time,
so whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.

604
00:48:55,696 --> 00:48:58,407
I tell you once again. Surrender!

605
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,825
It will not happen.

606
00:48:59,908 --> 00:49:02,036
For the last time! Surrender!

607
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:03,412
Death first!

608
00:49:03,495 --> 00:49:05,456
Will you promise not to hurt him?

609
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:06,498
What was that?

610
00:49:06,582 --> 00:49:08,000
What was that?

611
00:49:08,751 --> 00:49:12,254
If we surrender and I return with you,

612
00:49:12,338 --> 00:49:14,632
will you promise not to hurt this man?

613
00:49:14,715 --> 00:49:18,260
May I live a thousand years
and never hunt again.

614
00:49:18,344 --> 00:49:21,430
He is a sailor on the pirate ship <i>Revenge.</i>

615
00:49:21,513 --> 00:49:23,682
Promise to return him to his ship.

616
00:49:24,266 --> 00:49:26,268
I swear it will be done.

617
00:49:28,479 --> 00:49:32,775
Once we are out of sight, take him back to Florin
and throw him in the Pit of Despair.

618
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:35,486
I swear it will be done.

619
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:39,740
I thought you were dead once,
and it almost destroyed me.

620
00:49:40,532 --> 00:49:42,993
I could not bear it if you died again,

621
00:49:43,702 --> 00:49:45,871
not when I could save you.

622
00:49:57,966 --> 00:49:59,259
Come, sir.

623
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:01,595
We must get you to your ship.

624
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,562
We are men of action.

625
00:50:10,646 --> 00:50:12,606
Lies do not become us.

626
00:50:13,565 --> 00:50:15,067
Well spoken, sir.

627
00:50:23,325 --> 00:50:26,829
- What is it?
- You have six fingers on your right hand.

628
00:50:27,454 --> 00:50:29,081
Someone was looking for you.

629
00:51:14,668 --> 00:51:18,172
- Where am I?
- The Pit of Despair.

630
00:51:18,255 --> 00:51:22,885
Don't even think â€’

631
00:51:23,635 --> 00:51:26,096
Don't even think about trying to escape.

632
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,973
The chains are far too thick.

633
00:51:28,056 --> 00:51:30,058
And don't dream of being rescued either.

634
00:51:30,142 --> 00:51:32,311
The only way in is secret.

635
00:51:32,394 --> 00:51:36,023
Only the prince, the count, and I
know how to get in and out.

636
00:51:36,106 --> 00:51:37,900
Then I'm here till I die?

637
00:51:37,983 --> 00:51:39,818
Till they kill you. Yeah.

638
00:51:45,491 --> 00:51:47,159
Then why bother curing me?

639
00:51:47,242 --> 00:51:51,872
Well, the prince and the count always insist
on everyone being healthy before they're broken.

640
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:53,415
So it's to be torture?

641
00:51:55,459 --> 00:51:56,960
I can cope with torture.

642
00:51:59,797 --> 00:52:01,048
You don't believe me?

643
00:52:02,132 --> 00:52:04,885
You survived the Fire Swamp.
You must be very brave.

644
00:52:05,928 --> 00:52:08,931
But nobody withstands the Machine.

645
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:25,823
She's been like that
ever since the Fire Swamp.

646
00:52:26,907 --> 00:52:29,785
It's my father's failing health
that's upsetting her.

647
00:52:30,786 --> 00:52:32,287
Of course.

648
00:52:34,706 --> 00:52:37,376
<i>"The king died that very night.</i>

649
00:52:37,459 --> 00:52:39,837
<i>And before the following dawn,</i>

650
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,464
<i>Buttercup and Humperdinck were married.</i>

651
00:52:42,548 --> 00:52:46,718
<i>And at noon, she met her subjects again,
this time as their queen."</i>

652
00:52:46,802 --> 00:52:49,304
My father's final words were â€’

653
00:52:49,388 --> 00:52:51,306
<i>Hold it. Hold it. Grandpa.</i>

654
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:54,184
You read that wrong.
She doesn't marry Humperdinck.

655
00:52:54,268 --> 00:52:56,854
She marries Westley. I'm just sure of it.

656
00:52:56,937 --> 00:53:02,025
After all that Westley did for her,
if she didn't marry him, it wouldn't be fair.

657
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:05,946
Well, who says life is fair?
Where is that written?

658
00:53:06,029 --> 00:53:07,447
Life isn't always fair.

659
00:53:07,531 --> 00:53:11,493
I'm telling you, you're messing up the story!
Now, get it right!

660
00:53:11,577 --> 00:53:13,787
Do you want me to go on with this?

661
00:53:14,496 --> 00:53:17,332
- Yes.
- All right, then. No more interruptions.

662
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:22,087
"At noon, she met her subjects again,
this time as their queen."

663
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,923
My father's final words were:

664
00:53:25,632 --> 00:53:30,971
"Love her as I loved her,
and there will be joy."

665
00:53:31,054 --> 00:53:34,016
I present to you your queen,

666
00:53:34,641 --> 00:53:37,644
Queen Buttercup.

667
00:53:48,697 --> 00:53:52,659
Boo! Boo!

668
00:53:52,743 --> 00:53:55,078
Boo!

669
00:53:55,162 --> 00:53:56,622
Why do you do this?

670
00:53:56,705 --> 00:54:00,542
Because you had love in your hands,
and you gave it up!

671
00:54:00,626 --> 00:54:03,045
But they would've killed Westley
if I hadn't done it.

672
00:54:03,128 --> 00:54:06,965
Your true love lives,
and you marry another!

673
00:54:07,049 --> 00:54:11,970
True love saved her in the Fire Swamp,
and she treated it like garbage.

674
00:54:12,054 --> 00:54:15,641
And that's what she is,
the Queen of Refuse!

675
00:54:15,724 --> 00:54:18,393
So bow down to her, if you want.
Bow to her.

676
00:54:18,477 --> 00:54:22,022
Bow to the Queen of Slime,
the Queen of Filth,

677
00:54:22,105 --> 00:54:24,399
the Queen of Putrescence!

678
00:54:24,483 --> 00:54:26,693
Boo! Boo!

679
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:29,237
Rubbish! Filth! Slime!

680
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:31,156
Muck! Boo!

681
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:34,117
Boo! Boo!

682
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:39,414
<i>"It was ten days till the wedding.</i>

683
00:54:39,498 --> 00:54:44,461
<i>The king still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares
were growing steadily worse."</i>

684
00:54:44,544 --> 00:54:47,839
<i>See? Didn't I tell you she'd
never marry that rotten Humperdinck?</i>

685
00:54:47,923 --> 00:54:50,092
<i>Yes, you're very smart. Shut up.</i>

686
00:54:51,093 --> 00:54:55,013
It comes to this:
I love Westley. I always have.

687
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:57,474
I know now I always will.

688
00:54:57,557 --> 00:55:00,519
If you tell me I must marry you in ten days,

689
00:55:00,602 --> 00:55:03,188
please believe I will be dead by morning.

690
00:55:10,237 --> 00:55:12,656
I could never cause you grief.

691
00:55:13,365 --> 00:55:16,702
Consider our wedding off.

692
00:55:16,785 --> 00:55:21,331
You, um, returned this Westley to his ship?

693
00:55:21,415 --> 00:55:24,126
- Yes.
- Then we will simply alert him.

694
00:55:25,752 --> 00:55:27,045
Beloved...

695
00:55:28,088 --> 00:55:30,799
are you certain he still wants you?

696
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:35,846
After all, it was you who did the leaving
in the Fire Swamp,

697
00:55:35,929 --> 00:55:40,308
not to mention that, um, pirates
are not known to be men of their words.

698
00:55:40,392 --> 00:55:42,853
My Westley will always come for me.

699
00:55:44,354 --> 00:55:45,939
Ah.

700
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:51,319
I suggest a deal.

701
00:55:51,987 --> 00:55:54,489
You write four copies of a letter.

702
00:55:54,573 --> 00:55:57,951
I'll send my four fastest ships,
one in each direction.

703
00:55:58,035 --> 00:56:01,329
The Dread Pirate Roberts is always
close to Florin this time of year.

704
00:56:01,413 --> 00:56:04,291
We'll run up the white flag
and deliver your message.

705
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:07,627
If Westley wants you, bless you both.

706
00:56:08,837 --> 00:56:10,338
If not...

707
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:17,054
please consider me
as an alternative to suicide.

708
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,931
Are we agreed?

709
00:56:23,685 --> 00:56:27,105
Your princess
is really quite a winning creature.

710
00:56:27,189 --> 00:56:29,691
A trifle simple, perhaps,
but her appeal is undeniable.

711
00:56:29,775 --> 00:56:31,610
I know.
The people are quite taken with her.

712
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:33,737
It's odd,

713
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,782
but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered
on our engagement day,

714
00:56:36,865 --> 00:56:38,366
I thought that was clever.

715
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:42,287
But it's going to be so much more moving
when I strangle her on our wedding night.

716
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,874
Once Guilder is blamed,
the nation will be truly outraged.

717
00:56:45,957 --> 00:56:48,043
They'll demand we go to war.

718
00:56:51,171 --> 00:56:53,882
Now, where is that secret knot?

719
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:56,593
It's impossible to find.

720
00:56:58,845 --> 00:57:02,224
Ah. Are you coming down into the pit?

721
00:57:02,307 --> 00:57:06,353
Westley's got his strength back.
I'm starting him on the Machine tonight.

722
00:57:06,895 --> 00:57:08,647
Tyrone...

723
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:11,024
you know how much I love
watching you work.

724
00:57:11,108 --> 00:57:13,652
But I've got my country's
500th anniversary to plan,

725
00:57:13,735 --> 00:57:17,781
my wedding to arrange, my wife to murder,
and Guilder to frame for it.

726
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:19,533
I'm swamped.

727
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:24,287
Get some rest.

728
00:57:24,371 --> 00:57:27,290
If you haven't got your health,
you haven't got anything.

729
00:57:44,015 --> 00:57:45,308
Beautiful, isn't it?

730
00:57:46,643 --> 00:57:49,646
Took me half a lifetime to invent it.

731
00:57:50,522 --> 00:57:53,942
I'm sure you've discovered
my deep and abiding interest in pain.

732
00:57:54,025 --> 00:57:57,195
At present, I'm writing
the definitive work on the subject.

733
00:57:57,279 --> 00:58:01,575
So I want you to be totally honest with me
on how the Machine makes you feel.

734
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:06,163
This being our first try,
I'll use the lowest setting.

735
00:58:42,157 --> 00:58:46,328
As you know, the concept
of the suction pump is centuries old.

736
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:51,166
Well, really, that's all this is,
except that instead of sucking water,

737
00:58:51,249 --> 00:58:52,751
I'm sucking life.

738
00:58:53,752 --> 00:58:56,796
I've just sucked one year of your life away.

739
00:58:57,422 --> 00:58:59,174
I might one day go as high as five,

740
00:58:59,257 --> 00:59:01,927
but I really don't know
what that would do to you.

741
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:05,055
So let's just start with what we have.

742
00:59:05,597 --> 00:59:08,391
What did this do to you? Tell me.

743
00:59:08,475 --> 00:59:12,270
And remember,
this is for posterity, so be honest.

744
00:59:12,812 --> 00:59:13,855
How do you feel?

745
00:59:18,944 --> 00:59:20,445
Interesting.

746
00:59:30,664 --> 00:59:32,916
- Yellin.
- Sire.

747
00:59:42,717 --> 00:59:46,721
As chief enforcer of all Florin,
I trust you with this secret.

748
00:59:47,597 --> 00:59:50,600
Killers from Guilder
are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest

749
00:59:50,684 --> 00:59:54,562
and plan to murder my bride
on our wedding night.

750
00:59:54,646 --> 00:59:58,191
My spy network has heard no such news.

751
00:59:58,275 --> 01:00:00,402
Any word from Westley?

752
01:00:01,653 --> 01:00:03,738
Too soon, my angel.

753
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:06,533
- Patience.
- He will come for me.

754
01:00:06,616 --> 01:00:08,410
Of course.

755
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:15,208
She will not be murdered.

756
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:18,295
On the day of the wedding,
I want the Thieves' Forest emptied

757
01:00:18,378 --> 01:00:20,588
and every inhabitant arrested.

758
01:00:20,672 --> 01:00:22,757
Many of the thieves will resist.

759
01:00:22,841 --> 01:00:25,093
My regular enforcers will be inadequate.

760
01:00:25,176 --> 01:00:27,262
Form a brute squad, then!

761
01:00:27,345 --> 01:00:30,390
I want the Thieves' Forest emptied
before I wed.

762
01:00:30,473 --> 01:00:32,100
It won't be easy, sire.

763
01:00:32,183 --> 01:00:34,269
Try ruling the world sometime.

764
01:00:39,357 --> 01:00:41,401
<i>"The day of the wedding arrived.</i>

765
01:00:41,484 --> 01:00:44,738
<i>The brute squad had their hands full
carrying out Humperdinck's orders."</i>

766
01:00:52,329 --> 01:00:53,705
- Is everybody out?
- Almost.

767
01:00:53,788 --> 01:00:55,790
There's a Spaniard giving us some trouble.

768
01:00:55,874 --> 01:00:58,168
Well, you give him some trouble.

769
01:00:59,294 --> 01:01:00,337
Move.

770
01:01:04,674 --> 01:01:07,302
I am waiting for you, Vizzini.

771
01:01:08,261 --> 01:01:12,474
You told me to go back to the beginning,
so I have.

772
01:01:13,141 --> 01:01:16,353
This is where I am,
and this is where I'll stay.

773
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,606
I will not be moved.

774
01:01:19,689 --> 01:01:20,982
Ho there!

775
01:01:22,108 --> 01:01:24,402
I do not budge. Keep your "Ho there."

776
01:01:24,486 --> 01:01:25,987
But the prince gave orders.

777
01:01:28,323 --> 01:01:30,617
So did Vizzini.

778
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,119
When a job went wrong,
you went back to the beginning.

779
01:01:33,203 --> 01:01:36,873
Well, this is where we got the job,
so it's the beginning,

780
01:01:36,956 --> 01:01:38,958
and I am staying till Vizzini comes.

781
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:40,710
You, brute, come here!

782
01:01:40,794 --> 01:01:45,924
I am waiting for Vizzini.

783
01:01:46,508 --> 01:01:48,510
You surely are a meanie.

784
01:01:56,518 --> 01:01:58,144
Hello.

785
01:01:58,228 --> 01:02:00,855
- It's you.
- True.

786
01:02:03,274 --> 01:02:05,944
You don't look so good.

787
01:02:06,027 --> 01:02:08,613
Phew. You don't smell so good either.

788
01:02:09,155 --> 01:02:13,243
- Perhaps not. I feel fine.
- Yeah?

789
01:02:16,454 --> 01:02:18,957
<i>"Fezzik and Inigo were reunited.</i>

790
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,752
<i>And as Fezzik nursed
his inebriated friend back to health,</i>

791
01:02:22,836 --> 01:02:26,214
<i>he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
and the existence of Count Rugen,</i>

792
01:02:26,297 --> 01:02:27,799
<i>the six-fingered man.</i>

793
01:02:28,341 --> 01:02:32,846
<i>Considering Inigo's lifelong search,
he handled the news surprisingly well.</i>

794
01:02:35,807 --> 01:02:38,435
<i>Fezzik took great care in reviving Inigo."</i>

795
01:02:38,977 --> 01:02:41,062
That's enough! That's enough!

796
01:02:41,771 --> 01:02:45,150
Where is this Rugen now, so I may kill him?

797
01:02:45,233 --> 01:02:47,360
He's with the prince in the castle.

798
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:50,447
But the castle gate is guarded by 30 men.

799
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:56,911
How many could you handle?

800
01:02:57,495 --> 01:02:58,997
I don't think more than ten.

801
01:03:04,294 --> 01:03:05,587
Leaving 20 for me.

802
01:03:07,046 --> 01:03:09,340
At my best, I could never defeat that many.

803
01:03:12,886 --> 01:03:16,097
I need Vizzini to plan.
I have no gift for strategy.

804
01:03:16,181 --> 01:03:17,849
But Vizzini's dead.

805
01:03:18,641 --> 01:03:21,478
No. Not Vizzini.

806
01:03:22,437 --> 01:03:24,355
I need the man in black.

807
01:03:24,439 --> 01:03:25,523
What?

808
01:03:26,065 --> 01:03:29,444
Look, he bested you with strength,
your greatness.

809
01:03:29,527 --> 01:03:33,448
He bested me with steel.
He must have outthought Vizzini,

810
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:37,535
and a man who can do that
can plan my castle onslaught any day.

811
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:39,329
- Let's go.
- Where?

812
01:03:39,412 --> 01:03:42,123
- Find the man in black, obviously.
- But you don't know where he is.

813
01:03:42,207 --> 01:03:43,917
Don't bother me with trifles.

814
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,669
After 20 years, at last
my father's soul will be at peace.

815
01:03:46,753 --> 01:03:48,922
There will be blood tonight!

816
01:04:00,058 --> 01:04:01,726
Rise and report.

817
01:04:01,809 --> 01:04:05,480
The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
Thirty men guard the castle gate.

818
01:04:05,563 --> 01:04:08,733
Double it. My princess must be safe.

819
01:04:08,816 --> 01:04:10,902
The gate has but one key...

820
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:14,239
and I carry that.

821
01:04:16,866 --> 01:04:20,119
Ah, my dulcet darling.

822
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,123
Tonight, we marry.

823
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:27,585
Tomorrow morning,
your men will escort us to Florin Channel,

824
01:04:27,669 --> 01:04:32,924
where every ship in my armada waits
to accompany us on our honeymoon.

825
01:04:33,007 --> 01:04:35,510
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.

826
01:04:38,638 --> 01:04:40,390
Every ship but the four you sent.

827
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:42,767
Yes. Yes, of course.

828
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,435
Naturally, not those four.

829
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:48,106
Your Majesties.

830
01:04:52,277 --> 01:04:53,778
You never sent the ships.

831
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:56,447
Don't bother lying.

832
01:04:57,115 --> 01:04:59,909
Doesn't matter.
Westley will come for me anyway.

833
01:04:59,993 --> 01:05:01,828
You're a silly girl.

834
01:05:01,911 --> 01:05:04,038
Yes, I am a silly girl...

835
01:05:04,122 --> 01:05:06,666
for not having seen sooner
that you were nothing but a coward

836
01:05:06,749 --> 01:05:08,751
with a heart full of fear.

837
01:05:09,669 --> 01:05:13,590
I would not say such things if I were you.

838
01:05:14,173 --> 01:05:17,552
Why not? You can't hurt me.

839
01:05:17,635 --> 01:05:20,513
Westley and I are joined
by the bonds of love.

840
01:05:21,097 --> 01:05:25,143
And you cannot track that,
not with a thousand bloodhounds.

841
01:05:25,226 --> 01:05:29,188
And you cannot break it,
not with a thousand swords.

842
01:05:29,272 --> 01:05:31,482
And when I say you're a coward,

843
01:05:31,566 --> 01:05:35,445
that is only because you are the slimiest
weakling ever to crawl the earth!

844
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:41,117
I would not say such things if I were you!

845
01:05:55,923 --> 01:05:59,844
You truly love each other,
and so you might have been truly happy.

846
01:05:59,927 --> 01:06:02,305
Not one couple in a century
has that chance,

847
01:06:02,388 --> 01:06:04,349
no matter what the storybooks say.

848
01:06:04,432 --> 01:06:07,769
And so, I think no man in a century

849
01:06:07,852 --> 01:06:10,480
will suffer as greatly as you will.

850
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:17,320
Not to 50!

851
01:06:36,297 --> 01:06:39,550
Fezzik. Fezzik, listen.

852
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:43,513
Do you hear?
That is the sound of ultimate suffering.

853
01:06:43,596 --> 01:06:47,016
My heart made that sound
when Rugen slaughtered my father.

854
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,727
- The man in black makes it now.
- The man in black?

855
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:51,813
His true love is marrying another tonight.

856
01:06:51,896 --> 01:06:54,399
So who else has the cause
for ultimate suffering?

857
01:06:54,482 --> 01:06:58,361
Excuse me. Pardon me,
it's important. Fezzik, please.

858
01:06:58,444 --> 01:07:00,488
Everybody, move!

859
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:02,740
Thank you.

860
01:07:10,665 --> 01:07:13,000
Where is the man in black?

861
01:07:13,084 --> 01:07:15,294
You get there from this grove, yes?

862
01:07:16,629 --> 01:07:19,298
Fezzik, jog his memory.

863
01:07:25,096 --> 01:07:28,391
I'm sorry, Inigo.
I didn't mean to jog him so hard.

864
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:30,852
Inigo?

865
01:07:31,561 --> 01:07:36,023
Father, I have failed you for 20 years.

866
01:07:36,983 --> 01:07:38,860
Now our misery can end.

867
01:07:39,944 --> 01:07:41,696
Somewhere â€’

868
01:07:41,779 --> 01:07:44,949
Somewhere close by
is a man who can help us.

869
01:07:46,534 --> 01:07:49,412
I cannot find him alone.

870
01:07:49,495 --> 01:07:51,205
I need you.

871
01:07:52,331 --> 01:07:55,334
I need you to guide my sword.

872
01:07:55,418 --> 01:07:56,919
Please.

873
01:07:59,005 --> 01:08:00,840
Guide my sword.

874
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,558
He's dead.

875
01:08:53,309 --> 01:08:55,061
Just is not fair.

876
01:08:55,144 --> 01:08:58,564
Grandpa, Grandpa, wait. Wait.

877
01:08:58,648 --> 01:09:00,775
What did Fezzik mean, "He's dead"?

878
01:09:00,858 --> 01:09:04,362
I mean, he didn't mean <i>dead.</i>

879
01:09:04,987 --> 01:09:07,949
Westley's only faking, right?

880
01:09:08,866 --> 01:09:10,660
You want me to read this or not?

881
01:09:11,494 --> 01:09:14,872
- Who gets Humperdinck?
- I don't understand.

882
01:09:14,956 --> 01:09:19,502
Who kills Prince Humperdinck?
At the end. Somebody's gotta do it.

883
01:09:19,585 --> 01:09:21,254
Is it Inigo? Who?

884
01:09:21,337 --> 01:09:24,131
Nobody. Nobody kills him.

885
01:09:24,215 --> 01:09:25,758
He lives.

886
01:09:25,842 --> 01:09:27,677
You mean he wins?

887
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,638
Jesus, Grandpa,
what did you read me this thing for!?

888
01:09:31,389 --> 01:09:35,351
You know, you've been very sick,
and you're taking this story very seriously.

889
01:09:35,434 --> 01:09:37,270
I think we ought to stop now.

890
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:41,023
No, I-I'm okay. I'm okay.

891
01:09:41,107 --> 01:09:43,276
Sit down. I'm all right.

892
01:09:44,944 --> 01:09:46,320
Okay.

893
01:09:46,404 --> 01:09:48,656
All right, now, let's see. Where were we?

894
01:09:48,739 --> 01:09:50,992
Oh, yes.

895
01:09:51,701 --> 01:09:54,370
In the Pit of Despair.

896
01:09:56,539 --> 01:10:00,751
Well, the Montoyas
have never taken defeat easily.

897
01:10:00,835 --> 01:10:04,005
- Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
- The body?

898
01:10:04,672 --> 01:10:07,174
- Have you any money?
- I have a little.

899
01:10:07,884 --> 01:10:11,262
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle,
that's all.

900
01:10:13,514 --> 01:10:17,101
Go away!

901
01:10:20,521 --> 01:10:21,731
What? What?

902
01:10:21,814 --> 01:10:24,650
Are you the Miracle Max
who worked for the king all those years?

903
01:10:24,734 --> 01:10:26,819
The king's stinking son fired me,

904
01:10:26,903 --> 01:10:29,488
and thank you so much
for bringing up such a painful subject.

905
01:10:29,572 --> 01:10:32,783
While you're at it, why don't you give me
a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it?

906
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:34,035
We're closed!

907
01:10:37,955 --> 01:10:39,582
Beat it, or I'll call the brute squad.

908
01:10:39,665 --> 01:10:42,710
- I'm on the brute squad.
- You <i>are</i> the brute squad.

909
01:10:42,793 --> 01:10:45,046
We need a miracle. It's very important.

910
01:10:45,129 --> 01:10:46,756
Look, I'm retired.

911
01:10:46,839 --> 01:10:49,800
And besides, why would you want someone
the king's stinking son fired?

912
01:10:49,884 --> 01:10:51,969
I might kill whoever you wanted me
to miracle.

913
01:10:52,053 --> 01:10:53,429
He's already dead.

914
01:10:54,055 --> 01:10:56,682
He is, huh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.

915
01:11:11,447 --> 01:11:13,074
I've seen worse.

916
01:11:17,662 --> 01:11:19,705
Sir?

917
01:11:20,414 --> 01:11:21,666
Sir?

918
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:24,418
- Huh?
- We're in a terrible rush.

919
01:11:24,502 --> 01:11:25,878
Don't rush me, sonny.

920
01:11:25,962 --> 01:11:28,381
You rush a miracle man,
you get rotten miracles.

921
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:30,800
- You got money?
- Sixty-five.

922
01:11:30,883 --> 01:11:33,511
Sheesh! I never worked for so little.

923
01:11:33,594 --> 01:11:36,263
Except once,
and that was a very noble cause.

924
01:11:36,347 --> 01:11:38,516
This is noble, sir.

925
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:41,560
His wife is crippled.

926
01:11:42,478 --> 01:11:45,272
His children are on the brink of starvation.

927
01:11:46,065 --> 01:11:47,608
Are you a rotten liar.

928
01:11:47,692 --> 01:11:51,570
I need him to help avenge my father,
murdered these 20 years.

929
01:11:51,654 --> 01:11:54,365
Your first story was better.
Where's that bellows cramp?

930
01:11:54,448 --> 01:11:57,702
He probably owes you money, huh?
Well, I'll ask him.

931
01:11:57,785 --> 01:11:59,370
He's dead. He can't talk.

932
01:11:59,453 --> 01:12:02,623
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Look who knows so much, huh?

933
01:12:02,707 --> 01:12:07,128
Well, it just so happens
that your friend here is only mostly dead.

934
01:12:07,211 --> 01:12:10,339
There's a big difference
between mostly dead and all dead.

935
01:12:10,423 --> 01:12:12,091
Please, open his mouth.

936
01:12:13,884 --> 01:12:17,513
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive.

937
01:12:17,596 --> 01:12:19,432
Now, all dead â€’

938
01:12:19,515 --> 01:12:22,768
Well, with all dead, there's usually
only one thing that you can do.

939
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:23,728
What's that?

940
01:12:23,811 --> 01:12:26,313
Go through his clothes
and look for loose change.

941
01:12:32,236 --> 01:12:33,612
Hey!

942
01:12:33,696 --> 01:12:35,489
Hello in there!

943
01:12:35,573 --> 01:12:38,117
Hey! What's so important?

944
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,995
What you got here that's worth living for?

945
01:12:45,124 --> 01:12:48,669
True love.

946
01:12:48,753 --> 01:12:52,089
True love. You heard him. You could not ask
for a more noble cause than that.

947
01:12:52,173 --> 01:12:56,635
Eh, sonny, true love
is the greatest thing in the world,

948
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:58,220
except for a nice MLT â€’

949
01:12:58,304 --> 01:13:01,432
mutton, lettuce, and tomato sandwich,
when the mutton is nice and lean

950
01:13:01,515 --> 01:13:03,392
and the tomato is ripe.

951
01:13:03,476 --> 01:13:05,186
They're so perky. I love that.

952
01:13:05,269 --> 01:13:09,065
But that's not what he said.
He distinctly said, "To blave."

953
01:13:09,148 --> 01:13:12,068
And as we all know,
"to blave" means "to bluff." Huh?

954
01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:14,153
So you were probably playing cards,
and he cheated â€’

955
01:13:14,236 --> 01:13:17,364
Liar! Liar! Liar!

956
01:13:17,448 --> 01:13:19,992
- Get back, witch!
- I'm not a witch! I'm your wife!

957
01:13:20,076 --> 01:13:23,788
But after what you just said,
I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.

958
01:13:23,871 --> 01:13:26,791
- You never had it so good.
- "True love." He said "true love," Max.

959
01:13:26,874 --> 01:13:29,335
- Don't say another word, Valerie.
- My God, he's afraid.

960
01:13:29,418 --> 01:13:32,546
Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him,
his confidence is shattered.

961
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:35,674
Why'd you say that name? You promised me
that you would never say that name!

962
01:13:35,758 --> 01:13:37,259
- What, Humperdinck?
- Aaah!

963
01:13:37,343 --> 01:13:39,595
Humperdinck! Humperdinck! Humperdinck!

964
01:13:39,678 --> 01:13:43,307
- Humperdinck! Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
- I'm not listening!

965
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:47,686
True love lies expiring, and you don't have
the decency to say why you won't help.

966
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,356
- Nobody's hearing nothing.
- Humperdinck! Humperdinck!

967
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:51,941
This is Buttercup's true love.

968
01:13:52,024 --> 01:13:54,735
If you heal him,
he will stop Humperdinck's wedding.

969
01:13:54,819 --> 01:13:57,071
- Humperdinck!
- Shut up! Wait, wait.

970
01:13:57,154 --> 01:13:58,823
I make him better, Humperdinck suffers?

971
01:13:58,906 --> 01:14:01,617
Humiliations galore.

972
01:14:05,663 --> 01:14:08,624
That is a noble cause.
Give me the 65. I'm on the job.

973
01:14:08,707 --> 01:14:09,625
Whoo-hoo!

974
01:14:13,379 --> 01:14:15,131
That's a miracle pill?

975
01:14:15,714 --> 01:14:18,008
The chocolate coating
makes it go down easier.

976
01:14:18,092 --> 01:14:21,262
But you have to wait 15 minutes
for full potency.

977
01:14:21,345 --> 01:14:24,140
And you shouldn't go in swimming after
for at least, what?

978
01:14:24,223 --> 01:14:26,767
- An hour. A good hour. Yeah.
- Yeah, an hour.

979
01:14:26,851 --> 01:14:28,811
- Thank you for everything.
- Okay.

980
01:14:29,687 --> 01:14:32,690
- Bye-bye, boys.
- Have fun storming the castle.

981
01:14:32,773 --> 01:14:35,192
- Think it'll work?
- It would take a miracle.

982
01:14:35,276 --> 01:14:36,777
- Bye-bye!
- Bye!

983
01:14:49,748 --> 01:14:52,168
Inigo, there's more than 30.

984
01:14:52,251 --> 01:14:54,086
What's the difference?

985
01:14:54,795 --> 01:14:56,297
We've got him.

986
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:58,090
Help me here.

987
01:14:59,091 --> 01:15:01,594
- We'll have to force-feed him.
- Has it been 15 minutes?

988
01:15:01,677 --> 01:15:04,180
We can't wait.
The wedding's in half an hour.

989
01:15:04,263 --> 01:15:06,473
We must strike in the hustle
and the bustle beforehand.

990
01:15:06,557 --> 01:15:08,058
Tilt his head back.

991
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:10,811
Open his mouth.

992
01:15:15,232 --> 01:15:18,360
How long do we have to wait
before we know if the miracle works?

993
01:15:18,444 --> 01:15:20,196
Your guess is as good as mine.

994
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:22,531
I'll beat you each apart.
I'll take you both together!

995
01:15:22,615 --> 01:15:24,491
I guess not very long.

996
01:15:26,285 --> 01:15:29,455
- Why won't my arms move?
- You've been mostly dead all day.

997
01:15:29,955 --> 01:15:33,292
We had Miracle Max make a pill
to bring you back.

998
01:15:33,918 --> 01:15:36,420
Who are you? Are we enemies?

999
01:15:36,503 --> 01:15:39,423
Why am I on this wall? Where's Buttercup?

1000
01:15:39,506 --> 01:15:41,008
Let me explain.

1001
01:15:41,091 --> 01:15:43,219
No, there is too much. Let me sum up.

1002
01:15:43,302 --> 01:15:46,096
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
in a little less than half an hour,

1003
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,265
so all we have to do is get in,
break up the wedding,

1004
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:50,059
steal the princess, make our escape,

1005
01:15:50,142 --> 01:15:51,936
after I kill Count Rugen.

1006
01:15:52,019 --> 01:15:54,355
That doesn't leave much time
for dillydallying.

1007
01:15:54,438 --> 01:15:57,775
You just wiggled your finger.
That's wonderful.

1008
01:15:57,858 --> 01:16:00,694
I've always been a quick healer.
What are our liabilities?

1009
01:16:00,778 --> 01:16:04,365
There is but one working castle gate.
Come here.

1010
01:16:07,493 --> 01:16:10,287
And it is guarded by... 60 men.

1011
01:16:10,371 --> 01:16:14,583
- And our assets?
- Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.

1012
01:16:14,667 --> 01:16:17,753
That's it? Impossible.

1013
01:16:17,836 --> 01:16:21,257
If I had a month to plan, maybe I could
come up with something, but this â€’

1014
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:24,885
You just shook your head.
That doesn't make you happy?

1015
01:16:28,013 --> 01:16:32,476
My brains, his steel, and your strength
against 60 men,

1016
01:16:32,559 --> 01:16:35,813
and you think a little head jiggle
is supposed to make me happy, hmm?

1017
01:16:37,064 --> 01:16:39,984
If we only had a wheelbarrow,
that would be something.

1018
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:43,153
Where did we put that wheelbarrow
the Albino had?

1019
01:16:43,237 --> 01:16:44,863
Over the Albino, I think.

1020
01:16:45,572 --> 01:16:49,034
Why didn't you list that among our assets
in the first place?

1021
01:16:49,118 --> 01:16:52,830
What I wouldn't give
for a holocaust cloak.

1022
01:16:52,913 --> 01:16:54,456
There we cannot help you.

1023
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:57,084
Will this do?

1024
01:16:57,167 --> 01:16:59,628
- Where did you get that?
- At Miracle Max's.

1025
01:16:59,712 --> 01:17:01,880
It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.

1026
01:17:01,964 --> 01:17:04,174
All right, all right. Come on. Help me up.

1027
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,264
- Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
- Why? You can't even lift one.

1028
01:17:10,347 --> 01:17:12,558
True, but that's hardly common knowledge,
is it?

1029
01:17:13,225 --> 01:17:16,854
Thank you. Now, there may be problems
once we're inside.

1030
01:17:17,479 --> 01:17:19,565
I'll say. How do I find the count?

1031
01:17:19,648 --> 01:17:22,568
Once I do, how do I find you again?
Once I find you again, how do we escape?

1032
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:26,280
- Don't pester him. He's had a hard day.
- Right.

1033
01:17:26,363 --> 01:17:28,324
Right. Sorry.

1034
01:17:32,453 --> 01:17:34,246
- Inigo.
- What?

1035
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:36,123
I hope we win.

1036
01:17:36,915 --> 01:17:39,543
<i>You don't seem excited, my little muffin.</i>

1037
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:43,339
- Should I be?
- Brides often are, I'm told.

1038
01:17:44,298 --> 01:17:46,300
I do not marry tonight.

1039
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:49,303
My Westley will save me.

1040
01:18:41,647 --> 01:18:43,148
Mawidge.

1041
01:18:43,774 --> 01:18:49,071
Mawidge is what bwings us togewer today.

1042
01:18:49,696 --> 01:18:53,951
Mawidge, that bwessed awwangement,

1043
01:18:54,034 --> 01:18:58,497
that dweam wiffin a dweam.

1044
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:02,334
Stand your ground, men!
Stand your ground!

1045
01:19:07,047 --> 01:19:08,715
Stand your ground!

1046
01:19:09,174 --> 01:19:12,678
I am the Dread Pirate Roberts!

1047
01:19:14,096 --> 01:19:17,433
There will be no survivors!

1048
01:19:18,016 --> 01:19:19,768
- Now?
- Not yet.

1049
01:19:19,852 --> 01:19:24,314
My men are here, I am here,

1050
01:19:24,398 --> 01:19:28,235
but soon <i>you</i> will not be here.

1051
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:30,279
- Now?
- Light him.

1052
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:38,745
The Dread Pirate Roberts
takes no survivors.

1053
01:19:38,829 --> 01:19:44,209
All your worst nightmares
are about to come true!

1054
01:19:44,293 --> 01:19:46,253
...ven wuv,

1055
01:19:46,336 --> 01:19:48,755

fowever.

1058
01:19:53,677 --> 01:19:56,346
The Dread Pirate Roberts

1059
01:19:56,430 --> 01:20:00,350
is here for your souls!

1060
01:20:02,144 --> 01:20:03,604
Stay where you are!

1061
01:20:03,687 --> 01:20:05,606
Stand and fight!

1062
01:20:05,689 --> 01:20:07,691
Stay where you are!

1063
01:20:12,154 --> 01:20:14,656
So tweasuwe your wuv â€’

1064
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,450
Skip to the end.

1065
01:20:16,533 --> 01:20:18,619
Have you the wing?

1066
01:20:18,702 --> 01:20:22,122
Here comes my Westley now.

1067
01:20:22,206 --> 01:20:24,041
Fezzik, the portcullis!

1068
01:20:30,047 --> 01:20:32,424
Your Westley is dead.

1069
01:20:32,508 --> 01:20:36,512
- I killed him myself.
- Then why is there fear behind your eyes?

1070
01:20:40,641 --> 01:20:42,351
Give us the gate key.

1071
01:20:42,434 --> 01:20:44,436
I have no gate key.

1072
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,105
Fezzik, tear his arms off.

1073
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:49,024
Oh, you mean this gate key.

1074
01:20:50,192 --> 01:20:53,111
And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup â€’

1075
01:20:53,195 --> 01:20:56,114
Man and wife! Say, "Man and wife!"

1076
01:20:56,198 --> 01:20:58,116
Man and wife.

1077
01:20:59,243 --> 01:21:02,246
Escort the bride to the honeymoon suite.
I'll be there shortly.

1078
01:21:04,498 --> 01:21:06,333
He didn't come.

1079
01:21:40,784 --> 01:21:44,788
Kill the dark one and the giant,
but leave the third for questioning.

1080
01:21:56,216 --> 01:21:58,093
Hello.

1081
01:21:58,176 --> 01:22:00,387
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1082
01:22:01,346 --> 01:22:02,973
You killed my father.

1083
01:22:03,724 --> 01:22:05,434
Prepare to die.

1084
01:22:29,249 --> 01:22:32,210
Fezzik! I need you!

1085
01:22:32,294 --> 01:22:33,795
I can't leave him alone.

1086
01:22:33,879 --> 01:22:37,341
He's getting away from me, Fezzik! Please!

1087
01:22:37,883 --> 01:22:40,302
Fezzik!

1088
01:22:43,096 --> 01:22:44,598
I'll be right back.

1089
01:22:52,564 --> 01:22:54,650
Thank you.

1090
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:57,736
- Strange wedding.
- Yes.

1091
01:22:57,819 --> 01:22:59,821
A very strange wedding.

1092
01:23:00,739 --> 01:23:02,240
Come along.

1093
01:23:07,871 --> 01:23:09,498
What was that for?

1094
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:11,917
Because you've always been so kind to me.

1095
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,960
And I won't be seeing you again,

1096
01:23:14,044 --> 01:23:17,005
since I'm killing myself
once we reach the honeymoon suite.

1097
01:23:17,631 --> 01:23:22,010
Won't that be nice, hmm?
She kissed me!

1098
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,142
Sorry, Father.

1099
01:24:11,226 --> 01:24:12,728
I tried.

1100
01:24:13,645 --> 01:24:15,605
I tried.

1101
01:24:16,481 --> 01:24:20,986
You must be that little Spanish brat
I taught a lesson to all those years ago.

1102
01:24:22,028 --> 01:24:24,030
Simply incredible.

1103
01:24:24,489 --> 01:24:27,993
Have you been chasing me
your whole life, only to fail now?

1104
01:24:28,577 --> 01:24:31,288
I think that's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

1105
01:24:32,873 --> 01:24:34,541
How marvelous.

1106
01:25:11,787 --> 01:25:14,664
There's a shortage
of perfect breasts in this world.

1107
01:25:14,748 --> 01:25:16,583
'Twould be a pity to damage yours.

1108
01:25:17,334 --> 01:25:19,753
Westley! Oh, Westley, darling!

1109
01:25:23,006 --> 01:25:25,759
Westley, why won't you hold me?

1110
01:25:26,426 --> 01:25:28,428
- Gently.
- At a time like this?

1111
01:25:28,512 --> 01:25:31,598
That's all you can think to say? "Gently"?

1112
01:25:31,681 --> 01:25:33,475
Gently!

1113
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:50,367
Good heavens. Are you still trying to win?

1114
01:25:53,537 --> 01:25:55,914
You've got an overdeveloped
sense of vengeance.

1115
01:25:56,915 --> 01:25:59,835
It's going to get you into trouble someday.

1116
01:26:13,431 --> 01:26:17,269
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.

1117
01:26:17,352 --> 01:26:19,187
You killed my father.

1118
01:26:20,105 --> 01:26:21,940
Prepare to die.

1119
01:26:27,988 --> 01:26:29,531
Hello.

1120
01:26:29,614 --> 01:26:32,075
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1121
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:34,244
You killed my father.

1122
01:26:34,327 --> 01:26:36,121
Prepare to die.

1123
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:42,919
Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya.

1124
01:26:43,003 --> 01:26:45,505
You killed my father. Prepare to die.

1125
01:26:45,589 --> 01:26:47,632
Stop saying that!

1126
01:26:50,677 --> 01:26:51,511
Aaah!

1127
01:26:51,595 --> 01:26:54,306
Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya!

1128
01:26:54,389 --> 01:26:57,017
You killed my father! Prepare to die!

1129
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:58,602
- No!
- Offer me money.

1130
01:26:58,685 --> 01:27:01,479
- Yes.
- Power too. Promise me that.

1131
01:27:02,063 --> 01:27:04,524
All that I have and more. Please.

1132
01:27:04,608 --> 01:27:07,402
Offer me everything I ask for.

1133
01:27:07,485 --> 01:27:09,487
Anything you want.

1134
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:14,534
I want my father back, you son of a bitch.

1135
01:27:29,549 --> 01:27:32,052
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?

1136
01:27:32,135 --> 01:27:34,304
What hideous sin have you committed lately?

1137
01:27:34,387 --> 01:27:38,099
I got married. I didn't want to.
It all happened so fast.

1138
01:27:38,183 --> 01:27:39,893
- Never happened.
- What?

1139
01:27:39,976 --> 01:27:42,187
- It never happened.
- But it did. I was there.

1140
01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:44,981
- This old man said, "Man and wife."
- Did you say, "I do"?

1141
01:27:46,775 --> 01:27:49,569
Uh, no. We sort of skipped that part.

1142
01:27:49,653 --> 01:27:50,987
Then you're not married.

1143
01:27:51,696 --> 01:27:53,907
If you didn't say it, you didn't do it.

1144
01:27:55,283 --> 01:27:57,786
Wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?

1145
01:27:58,370 --> 01:28:01,373
A technicality
that will shortly be remedied.

1146
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:04,751
But first things first.

1147
01:28:07,504 --> 01:28:09,547
- To the death.
- No!

1148
01:28:09,631 --> 01:28:11,132
To the pain.

1149
01:28:13,176 --> 01:28:15,303
I don't think I'm quite familiar
with that phrase.

1150
01:28:15,387 --> 01:28:16,388
I'll explain.

1151
01:28:16,471 --> 01:28:19,516
And I'll use small words,
so that you'll be sure to understand,

1152
01:28:19,599 --> 01:28:22,394
you warthog-faced buffoon.

1153
01:28:23,853 --> 01:28:28,942
That may be the first time in my life
a man has dared insult me.

1154
01:28:29,025 --> 01:28:31,361
It won't be the last.

1155
01:28:31,444 --> 01:28:35,198
"To the pain" means the first thing you lose
will be your feet, below the ankles.

1156
01:28:35,281 --> 01:28:37,617
Then your hands at the wrists.

1157
01:28:37,701 --> 01:28:39,202
Next, your nose.

1158
01:28:39,285 --> 01:28:41,037
And then my tongue, I suppose.

1159
01:28:41,121 --> 01:28:46,209
I killed you too quickly the last time,
a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.

1160
01:28:46,292 --> 01:28:47,669
I wasn't finished!

1161
01:28:47,752 --> 01:28:50,630
The next thing you lose will be your left eye,
followed by your right.

1162
01:28:50,714 --> 01:28:53,967
And then my ears.
I understand. Let's get on with it.

1163
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:57,429
Wrong! Your ears you keep,
and I'll tell you why.

1164
01:28:59,389 --> 01:29:02,600
So that every shriek of every child
at seeing your hideousness

1165
01:29:02,684 --> 01:29:05,311
will be yours to cherish.

1166
01:29:05,395 --> 01:29:07,480
Every babe that weeps at your approach,

1167
01:29:07,564 --> 01:29:10,608
every woman who cries out,
"Dear God, what is that thing?"

1168
01:29:10,692 --> 01:29:13,486
will echo in your perfect ears.

1169
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,406
That is what "to the pain" means.

1170
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:18,992
It means I leave you in anguish,

1171
01:29:19,075 --> 01:29:22,078
wallowing in freakish misery forever.

1172
01:29:24,789 --> 01:29:26,332
I think you're bluffing.

1173
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:28,460
It's possible, pig.

1174
01:29:28,543 --> 01:29:30,545
I might be bluffing.

1175
01:29:30,628 --> 01:29:33,506
It's conceivable,
you miserable vomitous mass,

1176
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:37,135
that I'm only lying here
because I lack the strength to stand.

1177
01:29:37,886 --> 01:29:39,387
Then again...

1178
01:29:40,889 --> 01:29:42,974
perhaps I have the strength after all.

1179
01:29:59,324 --> 01:30:02,660
Drop... your... sword.

1180
01:30:07,415 --> 01:30:08,416
Have a seat.

1181
01:30:12,921 --> 01:30:14,422
Tie him up.

1182
01:30:15,465 --> 01:30:17,842
Make it as tight as you like.

1183
01:30:17,926 --> 01:30:20,011
Oh!

1184
01:30:21,179 --> 01:30:23,723
Where's Fezzik?

1185
01:30:23,807 --> 01:30:26,309
- I thought he was with you.
- No.

1186
01:30:26,392 --> 01:30:28,103
In that case â€’

1187
01:30:28,186 --> 01:30:29,270
Help him.

1188
01:30:29,354 --> 01:30:32,982
- Why does Westley need helping?
- Because he has no strength.

1189
01:30:33,066 --> 01:30:35,693
I knew it. I knew you were bluffing.
I knew he was bluffing.

1190
01:30:35,777 --> 01:30:38,446
- Shall I dispatch him for you?
- Thank you, but no.

1191
01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:41,950
Whatever happens to us, I want him
to live a long life alone with his cowardice.

1192
01:30:42,867 --> 01:30:47,038
Inigo! Inigo, where are you?

1193
01:30:48,498 --> 01:30:50,625
Oh, there you are.

1194
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:53,378
Inigo, I saw the prince's stables,

1195
01:30:53,461 --> 01:30:56,381
and there they were â€’ four white horses.

1196
01:30:56,464 --> 01:31:01,177
And I thought, there are four of us,
if we ever find the lady.

1197
01:31:01,261 --> 01:31:03,638
Hello, lady.

1198
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:07,058
So I took them with me,
in case we ever bumped into each other.

1199
01:31:08,017 --> 01:31:09,561
I guess we just did.

1200
01:31:09,644 --> 01:31:12,772
Fezzik, you did something right.

1201
01:31:12,856 --> 01:31:15,900
Don't worry, I won't let it go to my head.

1202
01:31:35,295 --> 01:31:38,381
You know, it's very strange.

1203
01:31:39,465 --> 01:31:41,718
I have been in the revenge business so long,

1204
01:31:42,427 --> 01:31:44,345
now that it's over,

1205
01:31:44,429 --> 01:31:46,764
I don't know what to do
with the rest of my life.

1206
01:31:48,349 --> 01:31:50,059
Have you ever considered piracy?

1207
01:31:50,602 --> 01:31:52,353
You'd make a wonderful
Dread Pirate Roberts.

1208
01:32:05,074 --> 01:32:06,993
<i>"They rode to freedom.</i>

1209
01:32:07,076 --> 01:32:10,872
<i>And as dawn arose,
Westley and Buttercup knew they were safe.</i>

1210
01:32:11,456 --> 01:32:14,000
<i>A wave of love swept over them.</i>

1211
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:16,377
<i>And as they reached for each otherâ€’"</i>

1212
01:32:19,130 --> 01:32:20,423
What? What?

1213
01:32:20,506 --> 01:32:22,967
No, it's kissing again.
You don't want to hear that.

1214
01:32:23,718 --> 01:32:26,554
Well, I don't mind so much.

1215
01:32:28,348 --> 01:32:29,849
Okay.

1216
01:32:31,309 --> 01:32:35,104
<i>"Since the invention of the kiss,
there have been five kisses</i>

1217
01:32:35,188 --> 01:32:38,191
<i>that were rated
the most passionate, the most pure.</i>

1218
01:32:38,858 --> 01:32:41,277
<i>This one left them all behind.</i>

1219
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:47,242
The end."

1220
01:32:50,286 --> 01:32:52,747
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.

1221
01:32:53,498 --> 01:32:54,415
Okay.

1222
01:32:54,499 --> 01:32:55,708
Okay.

1223
01:32:57,293 --> 01:32:58,294
Okay.

1224
01:32:59,545 --> 01:33:01,422
Okay.

1225
01:33:03,549 --> 01:33:04,968
Okay.

1226
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:08,096
All right.

1227
01:33:10,306 --> 01:33:11,683
So long.

1228
01:33:13,309 --> 01:33:14,894
Grandpa?

1229
01:33:18,314 --> 01:33:22,318
Maybe you could come over
and read it again to me tomorrow.

1230
01:33:24,237 --> 01:33:26,322
As you wish.

1231
01:35:28,027 --> 01:35:32,031
<i> Come, my love, I'll tell you a tale </i>

1232
01:35:33,032 --> 01:35:37,412
<i> Of a boy and girl and their love story </i>

1233
01:35:38,454 --> 01:35:42,959
<i> And how he loved her, oh, so much </i>

1234
01:35:43,793 --> 01:35:47,755
<i> And all the charms she did possess </i>

1235
01:35:49,048 --> 01:35:53,094
<i> Now, this did happen once upon a time </i>

1236
01:35:54,345 --> 01:35:58,391
<i> When things were not so complex </i>

1237
01:35:59,642 --> 01:36:03,980
<i> And how he worshipped
The ground she walked </i>

1238
01:36:04,063 --> 01:36:08,943
<i> And when he looked in her eyes
He became obsessed </i>

1239
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:15,575
<i> My love is like a storybook story </i>

1240
01:36:15,658 --> 01:36:20,079
<i> But it's as real as the feelings I feel </i>

1241
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:25,418
<i> My love is like a storybook story </i>

1242
01:36:26,461 --> 01:36:30,756
<i> But it's as real as the feelings I feel </i>

1243
01:36:31,924 --> 01:36:36,220
<i> It's as real as the feelings I feel </i>

1244
01:36:46,731 --> 01:36:52,820
<i> He said, "Don't you know
I love you, oh, so much? </i>

1245
01:36:52,904 --> 01:36:57,116
<i> I lay my heart at the foot of your dress" </i>

1246
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:02,663
<i> She said, "Don't you know
That storybook loves </i>

1247
01:37:03,998 --> 01:37:07,919
<i> Always have a happy ending?" </i>

1248
01:37:09,295 --> 01:37:13,299
<i> Then he swooped her up
Just like in the books </i>

1249
01:37:14,342 --> 01:37:18,554
<i> And on his stallion they rode away </i>

1250
01:37:19,639 --> 01:37:24,894
<i> My love is like a storybook story </i>

1251
01:37:24,977 --> 01:37:29,398
<i> But it's as real as the feelings I feel </i>

1252
01:37:30,274 --> 01:37:35,488
<i> My love is like a storybook story </i>

1253
01:37:35,571 --> 01:37:40,034
<i> But it's as real as the feelings I feel </i>

1254
01:37:41,202 --> 01:37:45,623
<i> It's as real as the feelings I feel </i>
