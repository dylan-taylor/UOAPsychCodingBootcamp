1
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,126
The usurper.

2
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:02,380
Caro? He's here.

3
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:25,153
Professor Perlman.
Welcome, welcome.

4
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:27,322
Thank you so much for having me.
Oh, my goodness.

5
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:28,865
You're bigger than your picture.

6
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,510
Well, I couldn't get
all of me in the photo.

7
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:32,285
That's the problem.

8
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:34,287
He seems very confident.

9
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:36,748
Mrs. Perlman.
Annella.

10
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,208
Oliver. Very nice to meet you.

11
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,769
Thank you for having me in your home.
Welcome.

12
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:41,044
Where's Elio?

13
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:42,587
I'll go down.

14
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:43,922
Elio?

15
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:47,217
You must be exhausted.
What gave me away?

16
00:03:58,854 --> 00:03:59,855
Hey.

17
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,440
Darling, come help Oliver
take his things up to his room.

18
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:03,942
He's already here?
Yes!

19
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:07,153
Every single one of these will.

20
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:09,155
Elio, Oliver. Oliver, Elio.

21
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,991
How you doing?
Nice to meet you. Elio.

22
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:12,784
You must be exhausted.

23
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:14,995
A little bit.
Come, come, come.

24
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:16,830
May I bring your things up to your room?

25
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:18,999
Sure. Yeah.
My room?

26
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:23,044
Follow him.

27
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:25,297
You're very welcome here.
Si.

28
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,340
Our home is your home.

29
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:34,890
You're leaving?

30
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:38,018
Hello.
Hi.

31
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:39,978
Nice to meet you.

32
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:08,632
My room is now your room.

33
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,550
I'll be next door.

34
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:16,848
We have to share the bathroom.

35
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:19,059
It's my only way out.

36
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:12,112
We're being called for dinner.

37
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:55,697
Sorry.

38
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:58,366
Yeah.

39
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,243
We're being called for dinner.

40
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,788
Yeah, I'm probably gonna pass.

41
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:06,541
Will you make an excuse for me
to your mom, though?

42
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,336
Thanks, man.

43
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:14,674
So, this is your old room, huh?

44
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:18,428
Thanks.

45
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:21,931
Later.

46
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:11,397
I'll take care of the tart.

47
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,945
Look at this.

48
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:18,363
Good morning, Professor.

49
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:19,906
Good morning.
Back from the dead.

50
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:21,991
Was I out that long?
It seemed like it, huh?

51
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:24,452
How are you?
I... Well, rested now.

52
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:25,995
Thank you.
I'm glad.

53
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,372
Would you like some espresso?

54
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:29,457
I would love some. Thank you very much.

55
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,876
This looks amazing.
I didn't take your seat, did I?

56
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,671
No, no, no. It's okay. Please.

57
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,714
Did you...
Did you recover from your trip?

58
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:38,174
I did. Yeah, big time.

59
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:39,968
Thank you.
Good.

60
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:41,636
I could show you around.

61
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,346
That'd be great. Thank you.

62
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,348
Is there a... Is there a bank in town?

63
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:47,725
I'd love to start
an account while I'm here.

64
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:50,395
Let me do it.

65
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:51,688
Sorry.

66
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:55,233
It happens to the best of us.
Yeah, well...

67
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:58,236
None of our residents has ever
had a local bank account.

68
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,779
Really?

69
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:01,656
Should I take him to Montodine?

70
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:03,950
I think they're closed
for summer vacation.

71
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:06,411
You try Crema.

72
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:07,787
Crema?

73
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,372
Thank you.

74
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:11,040
Is this your orchard?

75
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:12,542
These are Annella's trees.

76
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:16,504
Peaches, cherries, apricots...

77
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:19,340
Pomegranate.

78
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,890
Have another egg.

79
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:28,391
Oh, stupid.

80
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:30,268
No, no, no. I know myself too well.

81
00:09:30,351 --> 00:09:31,996
If I have a second,
I'm just gonna have a third,

82
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,940
and then a fourth, and then you're just
gonna have to roll me out of here.

83
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:37,942
Delicious.
Darling?

84
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,444
Thank you.

85
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:41,946
Shall I give him Anchise's bike?

86
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:21,069
So, what does one do around here?

87
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:23,780
Wait for the summer to end.

88
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:25,281
Yeah?

89
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:26,574
What do you do in the winter?

90
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:29,869
Wait for summer to come?
Well, we only come here for Christmas

91
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:31,537
and some other vacations.

92
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,057
Christmas? I thought you...
And Easter as well.

93
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:34,642
Thought you were Jewish.
Well, we are Jewish,

94
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,918
but also American, Italian, French.

95
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,254
Somewhat atypical combination.

96
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,215
Besides my family, you're probably

97
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,217
the only other Jew
to set foot in this town.

98
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:47,178
I'm from a small town in New England.

99
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:48,982
I know what it's like
to be the odd Jew out.

100
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,350
So, what do you do around here?

101
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:55,687
Just read books.

102
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,856
Transcribe music. Swim at the river.

103
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,608
Yeah?
Go out at night.

104
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,902
I don't know.
That sounds fun.

105
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:08,700
All right, buddy, thanks for the help.

106
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:19,460
Sorry. Sorry about that.

107
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:21,004
It's all right.

108
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:23,089
All right, later.

109
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:34,726
What do you have there?

110
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:36,728
That should all be...

111
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:41,649
What is this?

112
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:46,237
These are the continuation
of these archaeology department...

113
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:47,905
These are archaeology?

114
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:49,758
Yeah, those are archaeology.
The rest of these should be history.

115
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:50,867
Okay.

116
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,328
More apricot juice?
Yeah.

117
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:55,830
Here, tesoro.
Thank you.

118
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:57,290
Help yourself, darling.

119
00:11:57,373 --> 00:11:58,666
Thanks.

120
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,259
Help yourself to some more.

121
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:13,431
The word "apricot"
comes from the Arabic.

122
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:17,101
It's like the words "algebra,"
"alchemy," "alcohol."

123
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:18,770
It derives from an Arabic noun

124
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:20,772
combined with the Arabic article "al"
before it.

125
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:24,776
The origin of our Italian albicocca

126
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:26,486
is al-barquq.

127
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:28,988
It's amazing that today in Israel
and many Arab countries,

128
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:32,742
the fruit's referred to
by a totally different name, mismish.

129
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:35,703
I may have to disagree
with you there, Professor.

130
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:39,499
I'm gonna talk etymology,
so just bear with me a second.

131
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,019
You're right in the case
that most Latin words

132
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:44,295
do find their origins in Greek words.

133
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,739
However, in the case of "apricot,"

134
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,649
it's a little bit more
of a complicated journey.

135
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:49,133
How so?

136
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:52,178
Well, here, the Greek actually
takes over from the Latin.

137
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:55,223
Latin word being
praecoquum or precoquere.

138
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:57,117
So it's, "precook" or "pre-ripen,"
as you know.

139
00:12:57,141 --> 00:12:58,810
To be precocious or premature.

140
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,731
And the Byzantines, to go on,
then borrowed praecox,

141
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:07,151
which became prekokkia,
which then became berikokki,

142
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:09,070
which is how the Arabs got al-barquq.

143
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,749
That's courtesy of Philology 101.

144
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,419
Flying colors.

145
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:29,715
He does this every year.

146
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:48,025
It's about drink time. Let's go here.

147
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:51,195
Ciao, Romano.
Ciao, Oliver.

148
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,865
How are you?
All good.

149
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,663
Ciao, boys!

150
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:02,582
All good?

151
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:04,333
All good!

152
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:05,918
Let's see. What have we got?

153
00:14:06,002 --> 00:14:08,838
Can you start please?
Of course!

154
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:30,776
Good morning, gentlemen.

155
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:37,825
How do you know about this place?

156
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:40,995
Okay.

157
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:42,830
Go, Chiara!

158
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:51,631
No, no, no, no, no!

159
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:54,175
He's better than the guy
who came last year.

160
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:55,635
Remember?

161
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:57,553
Get in there!

162
00:14:57,637 --> 00:15:00,515
Much better!
See how cute he is.

163
00:15:12,235 --> 00:15:13,736
Elio, water!

164
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,531
Perfect timing.

165
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,639
What's the matter? Are you all right?

166
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,497
What, pinch a nerve?
I'm okay.

167
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:26,499
Here. Hold this.

168
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:28,584
Trust me. I'm about to be a doctor.

169
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:30,428
Hey, hey, come here.
See? That's the problem.

170
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:31,754
You're too stressed.

171
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:34,298
You just gotta relax a little bit.
I am relaxing.

172
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:36,133
Marzia, come here for a minute.

173
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:38,594
Back me up here.

174
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:40,513
Feel that. Right there?
Oliver.

175
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:41,847
It's too tight, right?
Yeah.

176
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:43,140
He needs to relax.
Oliver!

177
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:44,475
Later.

178
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,018
You should relax more.

179
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,438
Okay, guys, ready?

180
00:15:56,862 --> 00:15:58,739
Okay, our ball, our ball, our ball.

181
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:01,117
Twelve serving 11.

182
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,994
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

183
00:16:03,077 --> 00:16:05,371
Go, go, go. Yeah, good.
It's yours, it's yours.

184
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:10,334
Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella and
the others are coming over for dinner.

185
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:13,838
Is Oliver staying with us or going out?

186
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:15,256
Don't know.

187
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:17,633
What a movie star!

188
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:20,428
Yes, those Americans...

189
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:45,661
Sparkling wine!

190
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:47,997
He's late.

191
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:50,666
Don't you think...

192
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:54,670
Don't you think he's impolite
when he says, "Later"?

193
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:57,465
Arrogant.

194
00:16:57,548 --> 00:16:59,884
I don't think he's arrogant.

195
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:01,135
Just watch.

196
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:03,554
This is how he'll say good-bye
to us when the time comes.

197
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:05,848
With his... "Later."

198
00:17:07,141 --> 00:17:09,852
Meanwhile, we'll have to put up with him
for six long weeks.

199
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:12,063
Won't we, darling?

200
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:14,482
I think he's shy.

201
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:16,233
You'll grow to like him.

202
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:17,397
What if I grow to hate him?

203
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:18,611
Oh, no, sweetheart.

204
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:23,407
Take his plates away.
Very well, madam.

205
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,579
Darling?

206
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:50,601
Elio, play something.

207
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:52,395
I don't want to.

208
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:54,438
Why not?

209
00:17:54,522 --> 00:17:55,981
Because I don't want to.

210
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:58,401
Why don't you go
to Moscazzano with others?

211
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:00,194
Because I don't want to.

212
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:02,405
You're spoiling everyone's fun.

213
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:12,540
Play well, darling.

214
00:19:45,674 --> 00:19:47,551
Hey.
Hey.

215
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:48,928
What are you doing?

216
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:50,221
Reading.

217
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:54,296
How come you're not with everyone else
down by the river?

218
00:19:55,434 --> 00:19:58,229
I have an allergy. It's...
Yeah, me too.

219
00:19:58,312 --> 00:20:00,481
Maybe we have the same one.

220
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,027
Why don't you and I go swimming?

221
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,029
Right now?
Yeah.

222
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:09,281
Come on. Let's go.

223
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:11,659
Do we have to go right now?

224
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:14,662
I'll go get changed.
Okay.

225
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:16,205
Meet you downstairs.

226
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:36,392
See you downstairs.

227
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:13,804
Elio, what are you doing?

228
00:21:13,888 --> 00:21:15,472
Reading my music.

229
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:17,933
No, you're not.

230
00:21:18,017 --> 00:21:20,185
Thinking, then.
Yeah?

231
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:24,690
About what?

232
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:28,736
It's private.

233
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,571
You're not gonna tell me?

234
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:32,406
I'm not gonna tell you.

235
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:34,408
He's not gonna tell me
what he's thinking about.

236
00:21:34,491 --> 00:21:35,576
Elio.

237
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:37,328
I guess I'll go hang out with your mom.

238
00:21:38,495 --> 00:21:40,497
More apricot juice, please.

239
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:43,584
That's a good boy.

240
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,210
Thank God you're helping me.

241
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:09,318
Sounds nice.

242
00:22:09,985 --> 00:22:11,612
Thought you didn't like it.

243
00:22:17,534 --> 00:22:18,994
Play it again, will you?

244
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:30,339
Follow me.

245
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:04,665
That sounds different.
Did you change it?

246
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:07,418
Well, I changed it a little bit.
Why?

247
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,586
I just played it the way Liszt
would have played it

248
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,964
if he'd altered Bach's version.

249
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:13,924
Play that again.

250
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:16,051
Play what again?
The thing you played outside.

251
00:23:16,135 --> 00:23:18,429
You want me to play
the thing I played outside?

252
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:21,473
Please.
Of course.

253
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,582
I can't believe you changed it again.

254
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:49,209
I changed it a little bit.
Yeah. Why?

255
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:51,670
I just played it the way
Busoni would've played it

256
00:23:51,754 --> 00:23:53,255
if he'd altered Liszt's version.

257
00:23:53,338 --> 00:23:55,316
And what is wrong with Bach
the way Bach would've played...

258
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,884
Bach never wrote it for the guitar.

259
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:58,302
In fact, we're not even sure.

260
00:23:58,385 --> 00:24:00,262
Bach wrote it at all.
Forget I asked.

261
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:32,419
It's young Bach.

262
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:34,379
He dedicated it to his brother.

263
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:09,623
Hey, Professor.

264
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:10,874
Hello.

265
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,085
Here, please.

266
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:14,753
I need help.

267
00:25:16,755 --> 00:25:18,215
Just be honest.

268
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,508
How bad is it?

269
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:23,220
I think your insights here
are persuasive, but...

270
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:28,725
Have you been to the river?

271
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:44,408
Mafalda!

272
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:46,326
Isn't she beautiful?

273
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:07,222
Elio.

274
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:09,933
You sleeping?

275
00:26:11,393 --> 00:26:12,728
I was.

276
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:15,480
Listen to this drivel.
Tell me what you think.

277
00:26:16,356 --> 00:26:18,775
Wait.
What?

278
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:20,569
Can't hear you.

279
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:31,496
"For the early Greeks,

280
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,266
"Heidegger contends,
this underlying hiddenness

281
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,083
"is constitutive of the way beings are,

282
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:36,561
"not only in relation to themselves

283
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:39,213
"but also in relation
to other entities generally.

284
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:41,065
"In other words,
they do not construe hiddenness

285
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:44,593
"merely or primarily in terms of
entities' relations to human beings."

286
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:48,013
Does that make any sense to you?

287
00:26:48,096 --> 00:26:50,474
Doesn't make any sense to me.

288
00:26:50,557 --> 00:26:52,637
I don't think it makes
any sense to your dad, either.

289
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:55,562
Maybe it did when you wrote it.

290
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:03,362
That might be the kindest thing
anybody has said to me in months.

291
00:27:04,071 --> 00:27:06,073
"Kind"?

292
00:27:06,156 --> 00:27:08,158
Yep. Kind.

293
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:37,020
Hey, Elio.
Hey.

294
00:27:37,104 --> 00:27:38,480
Hey!

295
00:27:41,316 --> 00:27:42,484
Come here.

296
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,238
What's going on?

297
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:48,115
Is he trying to get it on with her?

298
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,367
Elio, he already succeeded?

299
00:27:52,286 --> 00:27:53,704
What do I know?

300
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:55,455
I'd love to be in his shoes.

301
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,457
Who wouldn't love to be in her shoes?

302
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:02,170
She wants him, no matter what!

303
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:47,591
Coming?

304
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:51,261
I'll come later.

305
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,548
Are you with me because
you're mad at Chiara?

306
00:30:09,631 --> 00:30:11,299
Why would I be mad at Chiara?

307
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:14,010
Because of him.

308
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:15,554
Because of who?

309
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:17,973
Of Oliver.

310
00:30:29,484 --> 00:30:30,861
Turn around.

311
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,335
Meet me here tomorrow night?

312
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:56,511
Wait for me!

313
00:30:56,595 --> 00:30:58,138
Come on.

314
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:13,570
We almost had sex last night...

315
00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:16,031
Marzia and me.

316
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:19,534
Well, why didn't you?

317
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:21,828
I don't know.

318
00:31:22,954 --> 00:31:25,665
Well, you know, it's better
to have tried and failed, right?

319
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:29,544
All I had to do was find the courage
to reach out and touch.

320
00:31:29,628 --> 00:31:31,171
She would have said yes.

321
00:31:31,254 --> 00:31:33,006
Well, try again later.

322
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:34,883
Try what later?

323
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:36,635
I just heard
from the people in Sirmione.

324
00:31:36,718 --> 00:31:38,553
They say they've come up with something.

325
00:31:38,637 --> 00:31:40,931
Fantastic.

326
00:31:41,014 --> 00:31:42,557
Going there today.

327
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:45,041
Would you like to come along?
I would love to. Thank you.

328
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,563
Smell this.
Can I come, too?

329
00:31:48,647 --> 00:31:51,233
On the condition you remain silent.

330
00:31:51,858 --> 00:31:53,211
Silent as in,
"He has too many opinions,"

331
00:31:53,235 --> 00:31:54,875
or silent as in,
"Just not telling anybody

332
00:31:54,903 --> 00:31:56,571
"what an amazing thing you've dug up"?

333
00:31:56,655 --> 00:31:58,198
Well, nothing has been dug up.

334
00:31:58,281 --> 00:32:00,909
It's what has been brought out,
out of the water.

335
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:11,127
What are you doing?

336
00:32:11,253 --> 00:32:13,171
Going to Lake Garda with my dad.

337
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:15,257
He wants to show Oliver
where he's dredging.

338
00:32:16,216 --> 00:32:17,592
Can you tell him I came by?

339
00:32:18,552 --> 00:32:20,428
He's inside with my dad, helping him.

340
00:32:22,264 --> 00:32:25,684
You were amazing last night,
on the dance floor.

341
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:27,644
He's a good dancer.
A good dancer.

342
00:32:30,021 --> 00:32:31,690
He's good-looking too.

343
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:34,943
Want to get us together?
No.

344
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:38,363
Come in.

345
00:33:15,108 --> 00:33:17,652
Dad always sits up front
with Anchise to navigate.

346
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:27,704
She seems to like you a lot.

347
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:30,457
She's more beautiful
than she was last year.

348
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:35,337
I saw her naked on a night swim once.

349
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,380
Great body.

350
00:33:37,547 --> 00:33:39,132
Trying to get me to like her?

351
00:33:39,257 --> 00:33:41,301
What would be the harm in that?

352
00:33:41,426 --> 00:33:42,594
No, no harm.

353
00:33:42,677 --> 00:33:45,477
Just typically like to go at those
things on my own, if you don't mind.

354
00:33:49,643 --> 00:33:50,894
I'll drive today!

355
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:57,275
Just don't play at being the good host.

356
00:33:59,152 --> 00:34:02,572
Anchise, take the afternoon off.

357
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:06,409
What's going on, boys?

358
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:13,041
Oliver, come. Sit up front.
Be my navigator.

359
00:34:13,124 --> 00:34:15,585
What? What?

360
00:34:30,642 --> 00:34:32,811
Dr. Roseburg.
Samuel!

361
00:34:32,894 --> 00:34:34,854
Benvenuto.
Look who's here.

362
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:38,199
He's grown a bit, eh?
And this is Oliver.

363
00:35:07,721 --> 00:35:09,472
Sammy! Come on!

364
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:23,987
Truce?

365
00:35:25,613 --> 00:35:27,282
Hey, boys.

366
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:38,251
The ship went down in 1827
on the way to Isola del Garda.

367
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:42,464
Gossip has it this statue
was a gift from Count Lechi

368
00:35:42,547 --> 00:35:45,717
to his lover,
contralto Adelaide Malanotte.

369
00:35:48,136 --> 00:35:52,515
There are four known sets,
after the Praxiteles originals.

370
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,142
This fellow's at number three.

371
00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:56,811
The Emperor Hadrian had a pair,
dug up at Tivoli,

372
00:35:56,895 --> 00:36:00,815
but one of the more philistine
of the Farnese Popes melted them down

373
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:04,736
and had them recast as a
particularly voluptuous Venus.

374
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:28,635
Who'd like to go for a swim
before we head back?

375
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:34,015
We're all such pros. If I got my own
statue, it would probably be on there.

376
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:42,524
Elio!

377
00:36:42,607 --> 00:36:44,567
Oliver!

378
00:36:47,987 --> 00:36:49,906
I have to go. I have to go.
Hey! Hey!

379
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:51,699
I have to go.

380
00:36:53,493 --> 00:36:55,036
Goodness.

381
00:36:58,832 --> 00:37:01,125
Are you going, too?
No, no.

382
00:37:01,209 --> 00:37:03,294
I should stay
and do some work on my book.

383
00:37:03,378 --> 00:37:05,964
Come on. How about a drink
to celebrate the day?

384
00:37:06,756 --> 00:37:09,259
Okay, maybe just one.
All right!

385
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,980
Marzia?

386
00:38:26,628 --> 00:38:29,589
The Cosmic Fragments by Heraclitus.

387
00:38:37,805 --> 00:38:41,059
The meaning of the river flowing
is not that all things are changing

388
00:38:41,142 --> 00:38:43,144
so that we cannot encounter them twice,

389
00:38:43,227 --> 00:38:46,356
but that some things
stay the same only by changing.

390
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:36,990
Sorry, Elio.
I brought some clean clothes.

391
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:43,538
Leave the door open.

392
00:39:44,664 --> 00:39:46,332
Thanks.
You're welcome.

393
00:42:35,126 --> 00:42:37,044
Darling, have you seen my Heptaméron?

394
00:42:40,173 --> 00:42:41,299
Mafalda.

395
00:42:46,137 --> 00:42:47,597
It's in German.

396
00:42:49,807 --> 00:42:50,850
Okay.

397
00:42:53,603 --> 00:42:57,398
I can't remember where we left off,
but I think you'll like this one.

398
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:02,570
Come here, darling.

399
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,324
So, I'll translate, huh?

400
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:19,754
"A handsome young knight
is madly in love with a princess.

401
00:43:19,921 --> 00:43:21,839
"And she, too, is in love with him,

402
00:43:23,174 --> 00:43:26,552
"though she seems not to be
entirely aware of it.

403
00:43:27,595 --> 00:43:29,347
"Despite the friendship..."

404
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:34,936
"...that blossoms between them,

405
00:43:35,978 --> 00:43:38,856
"or perhaps because of
that very friendship,

406
00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:42,443
"the young knight finds himself so..."

407
00:43:45,655 --> 00:43:47,949
"...so humbled and speechless

408
00:43:48,908 --> 00:43:53,037
"that he's totally unable to bring up
the subject of his love.

409
00:43:53,913 --> 00:43:57,625
"Till one day, he asks the princess
point-blank..."

410
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,138
"Is it better to speak or to die?"

411
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:19,563
I'd never have the courage
to ask a question like that.

412
00:44:21,148 --> 00:44:22,400
I doubt that.

413
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:29,532
Hey, Elly-Belly.

414
00:44:31,325 --> 00:44:33,494
You do know that
you can always talk to us.

415
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:43,254
My mom's been reading
this 16th-century French romance.

416
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:45,899
She read some of it to my dad and I
the day the lights went out.

417
00:44:46,507 --> 00:44:49,093
Yeah, about the knight that doesn't know
whether to speak or die?

418
00:44:49,176 --> 00:44:50,261
Right.

419
00:44:51,512 --> 00:44:52,930
So, does he or doesn't he?

420
00:44:54,932 --> 00:44:56,726
"Better to speak," she said.

421
00:44:58,686 --> 00:45:00,438
But she's on her guard.

422
00:45:01,814 --> 00:45:03,733
She senses a trap somewhere.

423
00:45:10,698 --> 00:45:11,991
So, does he speak?

424
00:45:13,242 --> 00:45:14,327
No.

425
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,747
He fudges.

426
00:45:19,832 --> 00:45:22,209
It figures. He's French.

427
00:45:28,466 --> 00:45:30,843
I gotta go to town in a little bit
to pick some things up.

428
00:45:30,926 --> 00:45:34,388
I can go. I'm not doing anything today.

429
00:45:35,681 --> 00:45:37,141
Then why don't we go together?

430
00:45:37,224 --> 00:45:38,392
Right now?

431
00:45:38,476 --> 00:45:40,686
Yeah. Right now.

432
00:45:41,729 --> 00:45:44,207
That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on.

433
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:47,031
"That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on."

434
00:45:58,913 --> 00:45:59,973
Mind if I put this in your bag?

435
00:45:59,997 --> 00:46:00,998
Yes, please.

436
00:46:12,093 --> 00:46:14,095
I straightened the wheels
and inflated the tires.

437
00:46:14,178 --> 00:46:15,596
Perfect. Thanks.

438
00:46:17,765 --> 00:46:22,144
I fell. I was coming home the other day,
and I scraped myself pretty badly.

439
00:46:22,436 --> 00:46:25,022
Anchise insisted on applying
some sort of witches' brew.

440
00:46:25,231 --> 00:46:26,649
I think it helped.

441
00:46:51,006 --> 00:46:52,383
Hold this for a second, will you?

442
00:47:12,278 --> 00:47:13,612
Want one?
Sure.

443
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:39,555
Not bad, huh?

444
00:47:40,347 --> 00:47:41,474
Not bad at all.

445
00:47:44,518 --> 00:47:45,811
I thought you didn't smoke.

446
00:47:47,438 --> 00:47:48,522
I don't.

447
00:47:54,153 --> 00:47:57,156
So, World War II, huh?
No. This is World War I.

448
00:47:57,948 --> 00:48:00,508
You'd have to be at least 80 years old
to have known any of them.

449
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,621
I never even heard
of the Battle of Piave.

450
00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:06,373
Battle of Piave was one of the most
lethal battles of World War I.

451
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:08,751
Hundred and seventy thousand
people died.

452
00:48:10,294 --> 00:48:12,129
Is there anything you don't know?

453
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:17,551
I know nothing, Oliver.

454
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,367
Well, you seem to know
more than anybody else around here.

455
00:48:24,391 --> 00:48:27,152
Well, if you only knew how little
I know about the things that matter.

456
00:48:30,064 --> 00:48:31,440
What things that matter?

457
00:48:38,781 --> 00:48:39,907
You know what things.

458
00:48:47,122 --> 00:48:48,457
Why are you telling me this?

459
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,240
'Cause I thought you should know.

460
00:48:56,048 --> 00:48:57,841
Because you thought I should know?

461
00:49:00,636 --> 00:49:01,971
'Cause I wanted you to know?

462
00:49:05,558 --> 00:49:07,518
Because I wanted you to know.

463
00:49:11,564 --> 00:49:13,232
Because I wanted you to know.

464
00:49:18,112 --> 00:49:20,447
'Cause I wanted you to know.

465
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:34,211
Because there's no one else
I can say this to but you.

466
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:42,720
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

467
00:49:50,102 --> 00:49:52,396
Don't go anywhere. Stay right here.

468
00:49:53,814 --> 00:49:55,482
You know I'm not going anywhere.

469
00:50:24,928 --> 00:50:26,472
They mixed up all of my pages.

470
00:50:26,555 --> 00:50:28,682
I'm gonna have to
retype this whole thing.

471
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:30,619
I'm not gonna have anything to work on
this afternoon.

472
00:50:30,643 --> 00:50:32,186
This is gonna set me back a whole day.

473
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,063
Damn it.

474
00:50:35,356 --> 00:50:37,274
Shouldn't have said anything.

475
00:50:37,566 --> 00:50:38,734
Just pretend you never did.

476
00:50:38,817 --> 00:50:41,070
Does that mean we're on speaking terms
but not really?

477
00:50:44,573 --> 00:50:46,909
It means we can't talk
about those kinds of things.

478
00:50:48,035 --> 00:50:49,286
Okay?

479
00:50:51,038 --> 00:50:52,247
We just can't.

480
00:51:07,346 --> 00:51:08,555
Hey.

481
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:11,308
Let's go, American!

482
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:34,039
Ready?
Let's go.

483
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,826
Pretty much.

484
00:52:19,126 --> 00:52:20,627
Oh, my God.

485
00:52:21,086 --> 00:52:22,755
Thirsty?
Yeah.

486
00:52:25,048 --> 00:52:26,633
Good morning, ma'am.

487
00:52:28,218 --> 00:52:29,511
Excuse me.

488
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:33,140
Could I ask for a glass of water?

489
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:45,152
I'll Duce.

490
00:52:45,235 --> 00:52:47,029
"People of Italy!"

491
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,531
That's Italy.

492
00:52:53,494 --> 00:52:55,037
Thank you.
You're welcome.

493
00:53:33,867 --> 00:53:34,868
Come on!

494
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,309
This is my spot. It's all mine.

495
00:54:01,311 --> 00:54:02,646
Come here to read.

496
00:54:04,106 --> 00:54:06,066
Can't tell you the number of books
I've read here.

497
00:54:08,777 --> 00:54:11,154
Oh, my God, it's freezing.

498
00:54:12,114 --> 00:54:13,740
Spring is in the mountains.

499
00:54:14,575 --> 00:54:15,993
The Alpi Orobie.

500
00:54:17,327 --> 00:54:18,927
The water comes
straight down from there.

501
00:54:45,022 --> 00:54:46,899
I like the way you say things.

502
00:54:46,982 --> 00:54:49,382
I don't know why you're always
putting yourself down, though.

503
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:51,612
So you won't, I guess.

504
00:54:55,949 --> 00:54:57,951
You really that afraid of what I think?

505
00:55:10,881 --> 00:55:12,561
You're making things
very difficult for me.

506
00:55:25,562 --> 00:55:27,105
I love this, Oliver.

507
00:55:32,986 --> 00:55:33,987
What?

508
00:55:38,325 --> 00:55:39,451
Everything.

509
00:55:44,498 --> 00:55:45,874
Us, you mean?

510
00:55:47,751 --> 00:55:49,002
It's not bad.

511
00:55:50,087 --> 00:55:51,129
It's not bad.

512
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:47,185
Better now?

513
00:56:55,777 --> 00:56:57,821
No, no, no.

514
00:56:58,905 --> 00:57:00,532
We should go.
Why?

515
00:57:01,074 --> 00:57:03,910
I know myself. Okay?
And we've been good.

516
00:57:03,994 --> 00:57:05,304
We haven't done anything
to be ashamed of,

517
00:57:05,328 --> 00:57:06,621
and that's a good thing.

518
00:57:07,247 --> 00:57:08,415
I wanna be good.

519
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:10,167
Okay?

520
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:18,800
Am I offending you?

521
00:57:25,682 --> 00:57:26,850
Just don't.

522
00:57:33,982 --> 00:57:36,151
I think it's starting to get infected.

523
00:57:38,111 --> 00:57:39,991
We can stop by the pharmacist's
on the way back.

524
00:57:40,363 --> 00:57:41,782
Excellent idea.

525
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:52,334
So we got the government
of Bettino Craxi...

526
00:57:52,459 --> 00:57:54,961
Because we don't do anything
but talk, talk, talk.

527
00:57:55,087 --> 00:57:56,963
Let me speak.

528
00:57:57,089 --> 00:58:00,592
We have five parties
that do nothing but fight.

529
00:58:00,675 --> 00:58:03,428
Smoke and shut up!
Let them speak, him, her.

530
00:58:03,637 --> 00:58:06,431
I'd like to know what they think too.

531
00:58:06,556 --> 00:58:09,351
Annella, what do you think?
A five party government!

532
00:58:09,476 --> 00:58:12,646
Darling, I think
it's the historic compromise...

533
00:58:12,729 --> 00:58:16,817
Don't say that. Compromises are tragic.

534
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,694
You've changed
since you inherited this place.

535
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,488
What's that got to do with it?

536
00:58:21,571 --> 00:58:23,365
What are you saying?

537
00:58:24,074 --> 00:58:25,742
You're mad, darling.

538
00:58:26,576 --> 00:58:27,786
You asshole!

539
00:58:27,869 --> 00:58:31,748
She's right.
And you don't say anything to her.

540
00:58:32,374 --> 00:58:34,501
Say something.

541
00:58:34,668 --> 00:58:36,294
You're resigned.

542
00:58:36,378 --> 00:58:38,964
Why don't we talk
about the death of Buñuel?

543
00:58:39,047 --> 00:58:42,092
Buñuel was a genius.

544
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:43,802
Know him?
Cinema isn't the answer.

545
00:58:43,885 --> 00:58:47,180
Cinema is a mirror of reality
and it's a filter.

546
00:58:47,973 --> 00:58:50,976
They broadcast The Phantom of Liberty
with constant interr...

547
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:53,562
Everyone loves Buñuel!

548
00:58:53,728 --> 00:58:55,230
Let's hear his opinion.

549
00:58:55,313 --> 00:58:57,774
He doesn't know anything about Italy!

550
00:58:57,899 --> 00:58:59,818
Say something. Give us your impression.

551
00:58:59,985 --> 00:59:01,486
Do you have an impression?

552
00:59:01,611 --> 00:59:03,655
Darling, he's American.

553
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,115
That doesn't mean stupid!

554
00:59:11,121 --> 00:59:13,165
Just stop.

555
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:17,169
I don't give an easy ride
to some politicians.

556
00:59:17,294 --> 00:59:20,130
She didn't say that.

557
00:59:20,297 --> 00:59:22,132
I'm going to go mad.

558
00:59:22,257 --> 00:59:24,092
What's the matter?

559
00:59:25,343 --> 00:59:27,095
What's wrong?

560
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,222
It's nothing. It happens all the time.

561
00:59:29,389 --> 00:59:32,517
Mafalda, ice?
It's in the fridge.

562
00:59:32,726 --> 00:59:35,270
You get used to absolutely everything.

563
01:00:11,765 --> 01:00:14,809
Don't you realize
you're mixing everything up?

564
01:00:14,935 --> 01:00:16,561
What are you talking about?

565
01:00:16,686 --> 01:00:19,439
There's no more politics, nothing.
He's left too.

566
01:00:21,066 --> 01:00:22,108
Elio?

567
01:00:26,154 --> 01:00:27,155
Elio.

568
01:00:27,822 --> 01:00:29,115
You all right?

569
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,660
Sit for a second.

570
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:35,121
If you insist.

571
01:00:39,751 --> 01:00:42,128
That wasn't my fault, right?
No.

572
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:45,966
I'm a mess.

573
01:00:49,135 --> 01:00:52,055
Well, the kitchen table sure is.

574
01:00:57,978 --> 01:00:59,479
Where did you learn to do that?

575
01:01:00,313 --> 01:01:02,899
My bubbe used to do this for us
when we were sick.

576
01:01:03,233 --> 01:01:04,651
Trust me, it helps.

577
01:01:09,656 --> 01:01:11,491
I used to have one of these.

578
01:01:11,658 --> 01:01:13,159
You used to?
Yeah.

579
01:01:13,702 --> 01:01:15,161
How come you never wear it?

580
01:01:15,578 --> 01:01:18,331
My mother says
we are Jews of discretion.

581
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,041
Well...

582
01:01:21,251 --> 01:01:23,128
I guess that works for your mother.

583
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:25,672
Funny witch.

584
01:01:31,011 --> 01:01:33,054
Fuck, you'll kill me if you do that.

585
01:01:33,138 --> 01:01:34,973
I hope not.

586
01:01:45,442 --> 01:01:46,985
Hey, are you leaving?

587
01:01:47,068 --> 01:01:48,862
Where's Elio?
He's inside.

588
01:01:48,945 --> 01:01:51,215
He had a bit of a nosebleed
during lunch, and he's just resting.

589
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:52,907
Really?
Yeah.

590
01:01:52,991 --> 01:01:54,617
Okay. Bye.
I'll be back in a minute.

591
01:01:54,701 --> 01:01:56,328
Don't go anywhere.

592
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:09,799
You okay?

593
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,933
Are we going out?

594
01:02:20,685 --> 01:02:24,230
I don't know if I can go out.
If my mom sees, she'll worry.

595
01:02:24,356 --> 01:02:26,441
She will?
Yeah, she's a pain.

596
01:02:31,863 --> 01:02:33,323
Where's Oliver?

597
01:02:33,448 --> 01:02:34,991
Don't ask me.

598
01:02:52,509 --> 01:02:53,927
Where's Oliver?

599
01:02:54,928 --> 01:02:57,639
Didn't he go out?
Would you like a smoothie?

600
01:02:57,806 --> 01:03:00,350
No, thank you. We're having dinner soon.

601
01:03:00,475 --> 01:03:01,768
All right.

602
01:03:01,893 --> 01:03:03,144
I'm going out tonight.

603
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:06,564
Don't make me worry.
What are you talking about?

604
01:03:06,689 --> 01:03:08,358
This is no good, madam.

605
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:10,568
Let him do his own thing.
Fine.

606
01:03:10,693 --> 01:03:12,695
Why's she hassling me? I'm 17.

607
01:03:12,862 --> 01:03:14,406
She's worried about you.

608
01:03:19,202 --> 01:03:21,704
You like him, don't you? Oliver?

609
01:03:22,705 --> 01:03:24,541
Everyone likes Oliver.

610
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:27,043
I think he likes you too.

611
01:03:27,168 --> 01:03:28,420
More than you do.

612
01:03:30,964 --> 01:03:32,924
Is that your impression?

613
01:03:33,049 --> 01:03:35,885
No, he told me.
When did he say that?

614
01:03:36,886 --> 01:03:38,263
A while ago.

615
01:04:02,787 --> 01:04:05,039
Mafalda, do you know where Oliver is?

616
01:04:05,165 --> 01:04:06,624
I have no idea.

617
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:13,334
Traitor.

618
01:06:24,387 --> 01:06:25,597
Traitor.

619
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:43,323
This is Craxi.
I draw the center of Craxi...

620
01:06:59,464 --> 01:07:00,840
Hey.
Hi!

621
01:07:01,966 --> 01:07:04,636
It's me. Is that Marzia?

622
01:07:04,761 --> 01:07:06,554
Sure it is! Can't you tell?

623
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:07,680
Sorry.

624
01:07:27,825 --> 01:07:29,035
Is that for me?

625
01:07:30,536 --> 01:07:31,704
Thanks.

626
01:07:48,388 --> 01:07:50,598
Do you really read a lot?

627
01:07:50,765 --> 01:07:53,434
I love reading too,
but I don't tell anyone.

628
01:07:54,102 --> 01:07:55,687
Why not?

629
01:07:55,812 --> 01:07:57,105
I don't know.

630
01:07:59,273 --> 01:08:00,525
I think...

631
01:08:01,067 --> 01:08:03,569
people who read are...

632
01:08:04,195 --> 01:08:05,321
kind of secretive.

633
01:08:06,823 --> 01:08:09,158
They hide who they really are.

634
01:08:10,535 --> 01:08:12,370
Do you hide who you really are?

635
01:08:13,162 --> 01:08:14,706
No, not with you.

636
01:08:14,872 --> 01:08:15,957
Not with me?

637
01:08:20,169 --> 01:08:22,213
Well, maybe a bit.

638
01:08:22,338 --> 01:08:23,756
What do you mean?

639
01:08:25,133 --> 01:08:27,427
You know exactly what I mean.

640
01:08:27,552 --> 01:08:29,220
Why do you say that?

641
01:08:29,887 --> 01:08:30,972
Why?

642
01:08:33,266 --> 01:08:34,475
Because...

643
01:08:35,184 --> 01:08:36,769
I think...

644
01:08:36,894 --> 01:08:38,855
you're going to hurt me,

645
01:08:39,021 --> 01:08:40,732
and I don't want to be hurt.

646
01:08:57,665 --> 01:08:59,500
You're so hard.

647
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,258
Wait.

648
01:09:07,383 --> 01:09:08,760
Kiss me.

649
01:09:16,392 --> 01:09:17,852
Is that good?
Yes.

650
01:09:19,353 --> 01:09:20,354
Are you lying?

651
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:34,535
Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
It's all right.

652
01:09:34,702 --> 01:09:36,829
Are you mad at me? Are you angry?

653
01:09:47,381 --> 01:09:50,051
What's so funny? Why are you laughing?

654
01:09:50,885 --> 01:09:52,386
Leave me alone.

655
01:09:53,596 --> 01:09:55,223
Fuck, that felt good.

656
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:04,816
Please don't avoid me.

657
01:10:04,941 --> 01:10:06,984
It kills me.
Can't stand thinking you hate me.

658
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:09,546
Your silence is killing me.
I'd sooner die than know you hate me.

659
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:10,863
I am such a pussy.

660
01:10:14,116 --> 01:10:15,409
Way over the top.

661
01:10:25,294 --> 01:10:27,296
Can't stand the silence.

662
01:10:28,089 --> 01:10:29,632
Need to speak to you.

663
01:10:52,655 --> 01:10:54,740
Did someone have a good night
last night?

664
01:10:55,408 --> 01:10:56,617
Not really.

665
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,832
Well, you must be tired, then.

666
01:11:03,749 --> 01:11:05,751
Or were you playing poker, too?

667
01:11:05,877 --> 01:11:07,837
I don't play poker.

668
01:11:08,588 --> 01:11:11,108
Several hundred color slides
of our boxer and the others like him

669
01:11:11,132 --> 01:11:13,009
arrived yesterday from Berlin.

670
01:11:13,551 --> 01:11:15,595
We should start cataloging them.

671
01:11:15,678 --> 01:11:17,430
That'll keep us busy till lunch,
I imagine.

672
01:11:17,513 --> 01:11:18,598
Sure.

673
01:11:21,392 --> 01:11:23,102
Beautiful, aren't they?

674
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:27,356
They're all so incredibly sensual.

675
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,443
Because these are more Hellenistic
than 5th century Athenian.

676
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:34,488
Most likely sculpted
under the influence of Praxiteles.

677
01:11:36,032 --> 01:11:37,199
Right.

678
01:11:39,368 --> 01:11:41,829
Greatest sculptor in antiquity.

679
01:12:05,311 --> 01:12:07,521
Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.

680
01:12:18,157 --> 01:12:20,993
Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.

681
01:12:24,246 --> 01:12:27,416
Muscles are firm.
Look at his stomach, for example.

682
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,795
Not a straight body in these statues.
They're all curved.

683
01:12:30,878 --> 01:12:34,382
Sometimes impossibly curved.
And so nonchalant.

684
01:12:34,924 --> 01:12:37,259
Hence their ageless ambiguity.

685
01:12:38,135 --> 01:12:41,263
As if they're daring you to desire them.

686
01:13:01,075 --> 01:13:03,160
Don't forget, Isaac and Mounir
are coming for dinner.

687
01:13:03,244 --> 01:13:06,038
Also known as Sonny and Cher.
Okay.

688
01:13:06,872 --> 01:13:09,351
I'd like you to wear that shirt
they gave you for your birthday.

689
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,376
No.

690
01:13:11,293 --> 01:13:14,189
Darling, they got it for you in Miami.
I'm sorry. It's too big. It's too big.

691
01:13:14,213 --> 01:13:16,149
Come on. It will make them so happy.
It looks ridiculous on me.

692
01:13:16,173 --> 01:13:17,213
I'll try it on for Oliver.

693
01:13:17,258 --> 01:13:18,819
If Oliver thinks
I look like a scarecrow in it,

694
01:13:18,843 --> 01:13:20,219
I'm not wearing it.

695
01:13:20,302 --> 01:13:21,429
Oliver?

696
01:13:22,972 --> 01:13:24,515
Hey, what time you got?

697
01:13:25,349 --> 01:13:26,726
It's 2:00.

698
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:34,233
Well... Later.
Later.

699
01:13:46,328 --> 01:13:47,747
Mafalda.

700
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:52,293
I won't be here for dinner.

701
01:13:52,376 --> 01:13:54,128
Okay, Mr. Oliver.

702
01:14:26,035 --> 01:14:27,745
Hello, Mafalda.

703
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:28,871
Marzia.

704
01:14:31,957 --> 01:14:33,292
Where are we going?

705
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:34,627
You'll see.

706
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:50,851
Stop it!

707
01:17:26,966 --> 01:17:28,926
How are you, buddy?
Hey!

708
01:17:29,051 --> 01:17:31,011
It's been ages.
It has, yes.

709
01:17:31,762 --> 01:17:33,555
How are you?
You've grown.

710
01:17:34,098 --> 01:17:35,099
How are you.
I'm good.

711
01:17:35,182 --> 01:17:36,392
Good to see you.

712
01:17:36,475 --> 01:17:38,477
Remember Marzia from last year.

713
01:17:38,602 --> 01:17:39,645
Hello.

714
01:17:39,728 --> 01:17:42,064
Marzia, remember Isaac?
The girl from Paris?

715
01:17:42,189 --> 01:17:43,524
Good to meet you.

716
01:17:43,649 --> 01:17:45,109
Want to eat with us tonight?

717
01:17:45,192 --> 01:17:46,485
No, no. I have to go.

718
01:17:46,568 --> 01:17:48,279
You're sure?
Yes.

719
01:17:48,362 --> 01:17:50,364
Okay.
Have a nice evening.

720
01:17:50,447 --> 01:17:51,573
Goodbye.

721
01:17:56,161 --> 01:18:01,583
This right here is the brand-new china
that you guys so kindly sent to us.

722
01:18:01,667 --> 01:18:04,169
It looks wonderful.
Come here, Mounir, Mounir.

723
01:18:04,253 --> 01:18:05,773
Come, come, come.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

724
01:18:07,715 --> 01:18:09,515
I can't put it on now.
They've already met me.

725
01:18:09,633 --> 01:18:10,986
Yes, you can.
It'll look like a put-up job.

726
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:12,011
Papa, it'll...
Yes.

727
01:18:12,094 --> 01:18:14,930
Papa, it'll look like a put-up job.
No misbehaving tonight.

728
01:18:15,014 --> 01:18:17,975
No... No laughing.
When I tell you to play, you'll play.

729
01:18:18,058 --> 01:18:20,561
You're too old not to accept
people for who they are.

730
01:18:20,644 --> 01:18:22,521
What's wrong with them?
What's wrong with them?

731
01:18:22,604 --> 01:18:24,523
You call them Sonny and Cher
behind their backs.

732
01:18:24,606 --> 01:18:27,206
That's what Mom calls them...
Then you accept gifts from them.

733
01:18:27,776 --> 01:18:29,987
The only person that reflects badly on
is you.

734
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:32,698
Is it because they're gay
or because they're ridiculous?

735
01:18:35,242 --> 01:18:37,953
If you know as much about economics
at Mounir's age,

736
01:18:38,037 --> 01:18:40,289
you'll be a very wise man, indeed.

737
01:18:40,414 --> 01:18:43,042
And a credit to me.

738
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:46,128
Now, just get into this, you.

739
01:18:54,928 --> 01:18:58,599
These are unbelievable. I just...

740
01:19:01,226 --> 01:19:02,895
Hey, look who's here.

741
01:19:50,275 --> 01:19:53,362
Sorry. I have to go to bed.
I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

742
01:19:53,821 --> 01:19:54,822
Thank you.

743
01:19:56,031 --> 01:19:58,158
Elio. Elio.

744
01:20:00,077 --> 01:20:01,703
Thank you.
Good night.

745
01:20:02,121 --> 01:20:03,455
Good night.

746
01:20:07,918 --> 01:20:09,044
Do I know you?

747
01:20:27,146 --> 01:20:28,939
Thank you again for everything.

748
01:20:35,654 --> 01:20:37,774
They're never gonna make it.
No, no. They're fine.

749
01:21:18,614 --> 01:21:19,740
I'm glad you came.

750
01:21:31,001 --> 01:21:32,252
Yeah, I'm nervous.

751
01:22:11,416 --> 01:22:12,976
I like what you've done with the place.

752
01:22:15,295 --> 01:22:16,380
It's nice.

753
01:22:43,782 --> 01:22:45,033
You okay?

754
01:22:50,581 --> 01:22:51,707
Me okay.

755
01:23:18,233 --> 01:23:20,152
Can I kiss you?
Yes, please.

756
01:24:20,253 --> 01:24:21,672
What are you doing?

757
01:24:22,547 --> 01:24:23,757
Nothing.

758
01:24:36,061 --> 01:24:37,396
Does this make you happy?

759
01:24:39,147 --> 01:24:41,027
You're not gonna get
a nosebleed on me, are you?

760
01:24:41,149 --> 01:24:42,776
I'm not gonna get...

761
01:25:12,472 --> 01:25:14,516
Off, off, off, off, off.

762
01:25:18,019 --> 01:25:19,396
Yeah. Just pull it.

763
01:25:21,857 --> 01:25:23,108
Or I'll pull it.

764
01:25:54,389 --> 01:25:55,682
Oliver.

765
01:26:36,431 --> 01:26:39,476
Call me by your name,
and I'll call you by mine.

766
01:26:43,355 --> 01:26:44,439
Elio.

767
01:26:46,483 --> 01:26:48,485
Oliver.

768
01:26:51,446 --> 01:26:52,447
Elio.

769
01:26:54,157 --> 01:26:56,493
Oliver.
Elio.

770
01:27:09,631 --> 01:27:11,091
Did we make noise?

771
01:27:11,633 --> 01:27:13,093
Nothing to worry about.

772
01:27:13,176 --> 01:27:15,804
I don't know.
Mafalda always looks for signs.

773
01:27:16,179 --> 01:27:17,764
Well, she's not gonna find any.

774
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,691
You wore that shirt
the first day you were here.

775
01:27:29,109 --> 01:27:30,652
Will you give it to me when you go?

776
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:43,391
Let's go swimming.

777
01:29:36,361 --> 01:29:39,030
Are you gonna hold
what happened last night against me?

778
01:29:39,406 --> 01:29:40,490
No.

779
01:30:49,768 --> 01:30:52,062
Elio. Come here.

780
01:30:57,650 --> 01:30:59,027
Take your trunks off.

781
01:31:14,751 --> 01:31:16,127
Well, that's promising.

782
01:31:16,377 --> 01:31:17,504
You're hard again.

783
01:31:17,879 --> 01:31:18,922
Good.

784
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:05,653
Professor, I got your note.
Thank you for reminding me.

785
01:32:05,677 --> 01:32:07,530
I'm gonna go into town and pick
up those typed pages today,

786
01:32:07,554 --> 01:32:09,514
so maybe this afternoon
would be a good time to...

787
01:32:10,473 --> 01:32:11,766
Later.

788
01:32:14,185 --> 01:32:15,945
We'll look them over later,
before you leave.

789
01:32:16,229 --> 01:32:18,857
Okay. So later.

790
01:32:19,274 --> 01:32:20,316
Later.

791
01:32:32,453 --> 01:32:33,538
Oliver.

792
01:32:44,549 --> 01:32:45,925
You're not sick of me yet?

793
01:32:46,676 --> 01:32:48,720
No, I just...
I just wanted to be with you.

794
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:55,018
I'll... I'm gonna... I'll go.

795
01:32:56,644 --> 01:32:58,604
Do you know how happy I am
that we slept together?

796
01:33:01,024 --> 01:33:02,066
I don't know.

797
01:33:03,693 --> 01:33:05,111
Of course, you don't know.

798
01:33:07,071 --> 01:33:09,199
I don't want you to regret anything.

799
01:33:09,908 --> 01:33:12,827
And I hate the thought that maybe
I may have messed you up or...

800
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,264
I don't want either of us
to pay for this,

801
01:33:15,288 --> 01:33:16,528
one way or another.
No, I...

802
01:33:16,581 --> 01:33:18,791
It's not like
I'm gonna tell anyone.

803
01:33:19,667 --> 01:33:21,467
You're not gonna be, like,
getting in trouble.

804
01:33:22,045 --> 01:33:23,463
That's not what I'm talking about.

805
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:36,893
Are you happy I came here?

806
01:33:43,816 --> 01:33:45,526
I would kiss you if I could.

807
01:33:57,205 --> 01:33:58,873
Times change.

808
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,750
Thank God we had the partisans.

809
01:34:00,917 --> 01:34:05,004
I know, but times have changed.
It's different.

810
01:34:05,129 --> 01:34:07,173
What do you think of Bettino?

811
01:34:07,298 --> 01:34:10,176
I don't like him.
I like him.

812
01:34:10,426 --> 01:34:12,720
I'm happy, actually.

813
01:34:15,723 --> 01:34:17,767
I don't know. We'll see.

814
01:34:20,228 --> 01:34:22,772
Anyway, they make the rules.

815
01:34:26,484 --> 01:34:27,986
Pasquina!

816
01:34:28,069 --> 01:34:29,320
Hello.

817
01:34:29,445 --> 01:34:30,780
Hello, ma'am.

818
01:34:31,739 --> 01:34:33,825
Tortelli cremaschi.
Yes.

819
01:35:57,408 --> 01:35:58,743
Oh, fuck.

820
01:37:33,212 --> 01:37:34,338
Fuck.

821
01:37:49,854 --> 01:37:51,272
Fuck.

822
01:38:50,248 --> 01:38:51,374
What did you do?

823
01:38:52,333 --> 01:38:53,751
Nothing.
No?

824
01:39:02,301 --> 01:39:04,387
Oh, I see.

825
01:39:04,762 --> 01:39:07,139
You've moved on
to the plant kingdom already.

826
01:39:07,223 --> 01:39:08,432
What's next? Minerals?

827
01:39:08,558 --> 01:39:10,226
I suppose you've already
given up animals.

828
01:39:10,309 --> 01:39:11,352
You know that's me.

829
01:39:12,228 --> 01:39:14,021
I'm sick, aren't I?

830
01:39:17,066 --> 01:39:18,985
I wish everybody was as sick as you.

831
01:39:20,361 --> 01:39:21,362
Please don't do that.

832
01:39:21,445 --> 01:39:23,340
You want to see something sick?
Please don't do that.

833
01:39:23,364 --> 01:39:24,508
You want to see something sick?

834
01:39:24,532 --> 01:39:25,575
Please don't do this.

835
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:26,826
Hey. Please don't do it.

836
01:39:32,081 --> 01:39:33,241
Why are you doing this to me?

837
01:39:34,333 --> 01:39:36,002
What are you doing?
Stop.

838
01:39:36,085 --> 01:39:38,087
You're fucking hurting me.
Then don't fight.

839
01:40:01,277 --> 01:40:02,361
Sorry.

840
01:40:02,945 --> 01:40:03,988
It's okay.

841
01:40:10,161 --> 01:40:11,621
It's okay.

842
01:40:24,175 --> 01:40:25,301
It's okay.

843
01:40:26,469 --> 01:40:27,928
I don't want you to go.

844
01:40:31,641 --> 01:40:34,143
God, we wasted so many days.

845
01:40:34,727 --> 01:40:35,871
Why didn't you give me a sign?

846
01:40:35,895 --> 01:40:37,772
I did. I did.
You didn't give me a sign.

847
01:40:37,855 --> 01:40:38,939
When?

848
01:40:39,982 --> 01:40:41,734
You remember
when we were playing volleyball

849
01:40:42,109 --> 01:40:43,611
and I touched you?

850
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:48,991
Just to show you that I liked you?

851
01:40:49,617 --> 01:40:52,536
And the way you reacted
made me feel like I'd molested you.

852
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:53,972
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.

853
01:40:53,996 --> 01:40:56,040
I just decided
I should keep my distance.

854
01:40:57,958 --> 01:40:59,251
I don't know.

855
01:41:03,714 --> 01:41:05,883
I come out here for hours
almost every night.

856
01:41:07,343 --> 01:41:08,386
I didn't know that.

857
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:12,515
That's funny, I...

858
01:41:13,599 --> 01:41:14,934
I thought that...

859
01:41:15,518 --> 01:41:17,228
Yeah, I know what you thought.

860
01:41:17,311 --> 01:41:19,313
Stop. Stop.

861
01:41:56,809 --> 01:41:58,144
"For Oliver.

862
01:41:59,228 --> 01:42:00,604
"From Elio."

863
01:42:11,073 --> 01:42:12,158
Elio?

864
01:42:24,044 --> 01:42:25,963
You disappeared for three days.

865
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:32,136
I had to work.

866
01:42:33,429 --> 01:42:35,723
You completely disappeared.

867
01:42:37,224 --> 01:42:39,143
Yeah, I don't know. I just...

868
01:42:41,979 --> 01:42:43,522
I had a lot to do.

869
01:42:53,574 --> 01:42:54,867
Am I your girl?

870
01:43:17,681 --> 01:43:20,601
Oliver has to go to Bergamo
for a few days.

871
01:43:21,894 --> 01:43:23,479
Research at the university.

872
01:43:24,772 --> 01:43:27,483
Then he'll fly home from Linate.

873
01:43:28,526 --> 01:43:29,860
But what about Elio?

874
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:35,115
Maybe it could be nice
for the two of them

875
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:37,034
to get away for a couple of days, no?

876
01:43:41,372 --> 01:43:42,623
What do you think?

877
01:43:45,167 --> 01:43:46,961
You know you've been
our favorite student?

878
01:43:47,503 --> 01:43:49,439
You must come back.
You sure you're not just saying that?

879
01:43:49,463 --> 01:43:51,507
Oliver.
Thank you very much, Professor.

880
01:43:53,467 --> 01:43:55,135
Oh, man.

881
01:43:56,929 --> 01:43:58,430
Please, please come back soon.

882
01:43:58,514 --> 01:44:00,714
Come back? I'm just going home to pack.
I'm moving here.

883
01:44:01,976 --> 01:44:03,102
You're welcome.

884
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:05,354
Oh, well...

885
01:44:06,063 --> 01:44:08,107
Thank you guys so much.
Of course.

886
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:09,525
Oliver, Oliver.

887
01:44:10,776 --> 01:44:12,236
Come back.
It's been...

888
01:44:12,611 --> 01:44:13,863
Come here, come here.

889
01:44:13,946 --> 01:44:16,323
It's been amazing. Thank you guys.

890
01:44:17,074 --> 01:44:19,493
Well, later, Perlmans.

891
01:44:19,577 --> 01:44:21,954
Later. Later, later, later.

892
01:44:32,006 --> 01:44:34,216
Tell Elio to call when you get there.

893
01:44:38,053 --> 01:44:39,638
Oh, no.

894
01:44:55,779 --> 01:44:57,907
Come for dinner tonight.

895
01:44:57,990 --> 01:44:59,241
Bring Marzia.

896
01:45:00,826 --> 01:45:02,077
Bye, darling.

897
01:45:10,127 --> 01:45:11,670
What?
Nothing.

898
01:45:11,754 --> 01:45:13,088
What?
Nothing.

899
01:45:23,724 --> 01:45:26,977
Oh, to see without my eyes.

900
01:45:27,978 --> 01:45:32,441
The first time that you kissed me.

901
01:45:32,524 --> 01:45:35,819
Boundless by the time I cried.

902
01:45:36,987 --> 01:45:40,866
I built your walls around me.

903
01:45:41,116 --> 01:45:42,117
Yes!

904
01:45:42,201 --> 01:45:44,745
White noise
What an awful sound

905
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:47,164
Oliver!

906
01:45:47,831 --> 01:45:49,124
Elio!

907
01:45:49,917 --> 01:45:51,502
Elio!

908
01:45:54,755 --> 01:45:58,759
Hand of God, deliver me.

909
01:45:59,009 --> 01:46:02,805
Oh, woe is me.

910
01:46:03,055 --> 01:46:05,516
The first time that you touched me.

911
01:46:05,599 --> 01:46:08,352
Oliver!
Elio!

912
01:46:08,602 --> 01:46:11,397
Oh, will wonders never cease?

913
01:46:12,606 --> 01:46:17,778
Blessed be the mystery of love.

914
01:46:30,582 --> 01:46:32,793
Lord, I no longer believe.

915
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:35,629
Yes!

916
01:46:35,713 --> 01:46:39,216
Drowned in living waters.

917
01:46:39,299 --> 01:46:42,553
Cursed by the love that I received.

918
01:46:43,804 --> 01:46:48,100
From my brother's daughter.

919
01:46:48,183 --> 01:46:51,395
Like Hephaestion who died.

920
01:46:52,688 --> 01:46:57,109
Alexander's lover.

921
01:46:57,192 --> 01:47:01,238
Now I'm prone to misery.

922
01:47:01,321 --> 01:47:03,449
The birthmark on your...

923
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:18,672
Oh, God.

924
01:47:44,907 --> 01:47:47,826
And I'm feeling low.

925
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:52,915
Understand I'm feeling low.

926
01:48:13,894 --> 01:48:15,104
You hear that?

927
01:48:16,438 --> 01:48:18,148
Wait, wait, wait.

928
01:48:20,275 --> 01:48:22,152
No, no, no, it's this way.

929
01:48:22,236 --> 01:48:24,321
Come on. Come on. You're missing it.

930
01:48:25,239 --> 01:48:26,281
Come on.

931
01:48:33,956 --> 01:48:35,749
Don't stop.

932
01:48:35,833 --> 01:48:38,752
A kiss is not enough...

933
01:48:38,836 --> 01:48:40,671
This. This.

934
01:48:40,754 --> 01:48:42,297
This. You.

935
01:48:42,381 --> 01:48:43,715
You are...

936
01:48:43,799 --> 01:48:45,551
Love my way.

937
01:48:45,634 --> 01:48:48,720
It's a new road.

938
01:48:49,763 --> 01:48:52,141
I follow...

939
01:48:52,224 --> 01:48:53,725
If you'll excuse me...

940
01:48:53,851 --> 01:48:55,853
Just one second.

941
01:48:56,770 --> 01:48:58,188
One second!

942
01:48:59,273 --> 01:49:02,818
They'd dearly make us pay.

943
01:49:02,901 --> 01:49:06,363
For laughing in their faces.

944
01:49:06,446 --> 01:49:09,575
And making it our way.

945
01:49:09,658 --> 01:49:14,454
There's emptiness behind their eyes.

946
01:49:14,538 --> 01:49:17,583
There's dust in all their hearts

947
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:19,793
I saw them last year.

948
01:49:20,627 --> 01:49:23,130
Richard Butler... fantastic!

949
01:49:23,297 --> 01:49:26,967
Really? We saw them in concert too.

950
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:29,887
We hitchhiked to London.

951
01:49:31,263 --> 01:49:32,306
What'd she say?

952
01:49:32,389 --> 01:49:35,559
It's a new road

953
01:49:35,642 --> 01:49:38,645
I follow.

954
01:49:38,729 --> 01:49:41,982
Where my mind goes.

955
01:49:44,109 --> 01:49:45,944
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

956
01:51:28,046 --> 01:51:29,423
Did you get your passport?

957
01:51:31,383 --> 01:51:32,676
You get your passport?

958
01:53:55,277 --> 01:53:56,486
Mafalda?

959
01:53:57,487 --> 01:53:58,613
Mom?

960
01:53:59,739 --> 01:54:01,158
Yeah, it's me.

961
01:54:02,492 --> 01:54:04,870
Yeah, everything is fine.
I'm at the station...

962
01:54:05,579 --> 01:54:06,913
in Clusone.

963
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:10,500
Listen, Mom, can you...

964
01:54:12,127 --> 01:54:14,087
Can you come get me, Mom?

965
01:55:04,930 --> 01:55:06,014
How are you?

966
01:55:06,681 --> 01:55:07,849
Good.

967
01:55:12,812 --> 01:55:15,065
I read the book you bought me.

968
01:55:15,774 --> 01:55:17,484
The poems...

969
01:55:17,609 --> 01:55:19,110
They're really beautiful.

970
01:55:19,236 --> 01:55:22,280
I love that... Antonia Pozzi.

971
01:55:25,450 --> 01:55:27,452
I'm sorry, excuse me...

972
01:55:27,577 --> 01:55:29,287
that you're sad.

973
01:55:30,580 --> 01:55:33,500
I'm saying that because
I wanted to tell you

974
01:55:33,625 --> 01:55:35,293
I'm not mad at you.

975
01:55:36,878 --> 01:55:38,213
Not at all.

976
01:55:45,845 --> 01:55:47,138
I love you, Elio.

977
01:55:52,561 --> 01:55:53,895
Stay friends?

978
01:55:55,939 --> 01:55:57,274
For life?

979
01:55:58,066 --> 01:55:59,359
For life?

980
01:57:07,344 --> 01:57:08,553
Missed you at dinner.

981
01:57:32,702 --> 01:57:34,162
So...

982
01:57:35,955 --> 01:57:36,998
Welcome home.

983
01:57:37,499 --> 01:57:38,500
Thanks.

984
01:57:40,043 --> 01:57:41,836
Oliver enjoyed the trip?
Yeah.

985
01:57:42,879 --> 01:57:43,922
I think he did.

986
01:57:45,298 --> 01:57:46,758
You two had a nice friendship.

987
01:57:49,052 --> 01:57:50,220
Yeah.

988
01:57:56,601 --> 01:57:59,145
You're too smart not to know how rare,

989
01:58:01,648 --> 01:58:04,025
how special what you two had was.

990
01:58:06,778 --> 01:58:08,822
Oliver was Oliver.

991
01:58:12,325 --> 01:58:14,244
Because it was him.

992
01:58:15,412 --> 01:58:17,247
Because it was me.

993
01:58:17,497 --> 01:58:19,499
Oliver may be very intelligent but...

994
01:58:20,417 --> 01:58:22,001
He was more than intelligent.

995
01:58:24,212 --> 01:58:25,255
What you two had,

996
01:58:27,215 --> 01:58:30,176
had everything and nothing
to do with intelligence.

997
01:58:30,844 --> 01:58:31,928
He was good.

998
01:58:34,264 --> 01:58:37,183
You're both lucky
to have found each other

999
01:58:38,268 --> 01:58:39,853
because you, too, are good...

1000
01:58:46,985 --> 01:58:48,570
I think he was better than...

1001
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:52,157
I think he was better than me.

1002
01:58:55,285 --> 01:58:57,162
I'm sure he'd say
the same thing about you.

1003
01:58:57,245 --> 01:58:59,622
Yeah. He'd say the same thing.

1004
01:59:00,582 --> 01:59:01,833
It flatters you both.

1005
01:59:05,837 --> 01:59:07,213
And when you least expect it,

1006
01:59:09,382 --> 01:59:12,677
nature has cunning ways
of finding our weakest spot.

1007
01:59:15,430 --> 01:59:19,017
Just remember, I am here.

1008
01:59:27,025 --> 01:59:28,985
Right now,
you may not wanna feel anything,

1009
01:59:30,487 --> 01:59:32,489
maybe you never wanted to feel anything.

1010
01:59:36,326 --> 01:59:39,120
And maybe it's not to me
you'd want to speak about this things

1011
01:59:41,539 --> 01:59:44,334
but feel something you obviously did.

1012
01:59:48,630 --> 01:59:50,757
Look, you had a beautiful friendship.

1013
01:59:52,467 --> 01:59:53,968
Maybe more than a friendship.

1014
01:59:55,678 --> 01:59:56,971
And I envy you.

1015
02:00:00,141 --> 02:00:03,478
In my place, most parents would hope
the whole thing goes away.

1016
02:00:04,312 --> 02:00:06,564
Pray their sons land on their feet,

1017
02:00:09,025 --> 02:00:10,568
but I am not such a parent.

1018
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:17,283
We rip out so much of ourselves
to be cured of things faster,

1019
02:00:18,409 --> 02:00:20,662
that we go bankrupt by the age of 30.

1020
02:00:22,372 --> 02:00:25,542
And have less to offer,
each time we start with someone new.

1021
02:00:28,086 --> 02:00:29,963
But to make yourself feel nothing

1022
02:00:30,964 --> 02:00:32,632
so as not to feel anything.

1023
02:00:34,759 --> 02:00:35,844
What a waste.

1024
02:00:43,810 --> 02:00:45,144
Have I spoken out of turn?

1025
02:00:50,149 --> 02:00:51,568
And I'll say one more thing,

1026
02:00:55,446 --> 02:00:56,656
it'll clear the air.

1027
02:00:59,659 --> 02:01:01,077
I may have come close

1028
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:04,163
but I never had what you two have.

1029
02:01:07,125 --> 02:01:10,336
Something always held me back

1030
02:01:11,713 --> 02:01:13,548
or stood in the way.

1031
02:01:18,553 --> 02:01:20,638
How you live your life is your business.

1032
02:01:20,930 --> 02:01:23,474
Just remember,

1033
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:28,813
our hearts and our bodies
are given to us only once,

1034
02:01:31,941 --> 02:01:34,777
and before you know it,
your heart's worn out.

1035
02:01:35,528 --> 02:01:37,614
And as for your body,

1036
02:01:37,989 --> 02:01:40,116
there comes a point
when no one looks at it

1037
02:01:41,784 --> 02:01:43,453
much less wants to come near it.

1038
02:01:47,123 --> 02:01:53,421
Right now, there's sorrow, pain.

1039
02:01:53,963 --> 02:01:55,298
Don't kill it,

1040
02:01:56,966 --> 02:01:59,636
and with it, the joy you felt.

1041
02:02:11,731 --> 02:02:13,107
Does Mom know?

1042
02:02:18,905 --> 02:02:20,448
I don't think she does.

1043
02:03:25,263 --> 02:03:27,849
Have you been to the Gaverine?
Yes.

1044
02:03:35,148 --> 02:03:36,482
Latkes.

1045
02:03:37,775 --> 02:03:39,444
May I?
Happy Hanukkah!

1046
02:03:39,569 --> 02:03:40,653
To you too.

1047
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:02,800
She looks a bit weak.

1048
02:04:10,683 --> 02:04:12,935
She comes highly recommended by...

1049
02:04:14,020 --> 02:04:18,024
Her special area of study is...

1050
02:04:21,444 --> 02:04:22,695
I'll get it.

1051
02:04:26,616 --> 02:04:27,617
Hello?

1052
02:04:27,700 --> 02:04:29,410
Elio, you there?

1053
02:04:30,536 --> 02:04:32,622
Hi.
Hey.

1054
02:04:33,164 --> 02:04:34,999
How are you.
I'm good.

1055
02:04:35,666 --> 02:04:36,751
I'm good. How are you?

1056
02:04:36,834 --> 02:04:38,754
How are your parents?
I'm good. They're fine.

1057
02:04:39,087 --> 02:04:40,213
Good.

1058
02:04:42,048 --> 02:04:43,174
I miss you.

1059
02:04:44,592 --> 02:04:45,760
I miss you too.

1060
02:04:47,011 --> 02:04:48,054
Very much.

1061
02:04:52,266 --> 02:04:54,936
I have some news.
News?

1062
02:04:57,772 --> 02:04:59,357
What, you're getting married?

1063
02:04:59,857 --> 02:05:01,025
I suppose.

1064
02:05:03,402 --> 02:05:05,947
I might be getting married
next spring, yeah.

1065
02:05:09,534 --> 02:05:11,202
You never said anything.

1066
02:05:13,329 --> 02:05:15,498
Been off and on for three years.

1067
02:05:19,544 --> 02:05:20,878
That's wonderful news.

1068
02:05:23,089 --> 02:05:24,215
Do you mind?

1069
02:05:31,556 --> 02:05:32,723
Oliver.
Oliver.

1070
02:05:32,807 --> 02:05:34,809
Oliver.
Hey, hey, hey.

1071
02:05:34,892 --> 02:05:36,252
Darling, when are you coming back?

1072
02:05:36,811 --> 02:05:38,104
I wish I was.

1073
02:05:38,437 --> 02:05:41,858
You caught us in the process of choosing
the new you for next summer.

1074
02:05:42,108 --> 02:05:44,610
And guess what? He's a she.
Oh, no.

1075
02:05:44,694 --> 02:05:47,405
Speaking of she's, I'm calling
to tell you guys I got engaged.

1076
02:05:49,365 --> 02:05:51,492
Wonderful!

1077
02:05:51,576 --> 02:05:53,452
Congratulations.
Mazel tov!

1078
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:55,681
Congratulations, Oliver.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1079
02:05:55,705 --> 02:05:59,083
Listen, we'll leave you...
We'll let you speak to Elio.

1080
02:05:59,292 --> 02:06:01,377
Happy Hanukkah!
Happy Hanukkah!

1081
02:06:01,460 --> 02:06:02,587
Bye, sweetheart.

1082
02:06:10,344 --> 02:06:11,762
They know about us.

1083
02:06:13,222 --> 02:06:14,390
I figured.

1084
02:06:16,851 --> 02:06:18,102
How?

1085
02:06:19,854 --> 02:06:21,731
Well, from the way your dad spoke to me.

1086
02:06:23,149 --> 02:06:25,067
He made me feel
like I was a part of the family.

1087
02:06:25,651 --> 02:06:26,944
Almost like a son-in-law.

1088
02:06:29,155 --> 02:06:30,281
You're so lucky.

1089
02:06:31,866 --> 02:06:34,660
My father would have carted me off
to a correctional facility.

1090
02:06:37,205 --> 02:06:38,456
Elio.

1091
02:06:42,084 --> 02:06:46,130
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.

1092
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:51,302
Oliver.

1093
02:06:54,180 --> 02:06:55,723
I remember everything.

1094
02:11:00,593 --> 02:11:01,886
Elio.

1095
02:11:04,138 --> 02:11:05,139
Elio.
