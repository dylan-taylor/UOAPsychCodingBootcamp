2

It happened just like that.

3
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,009
There was nothing anybody could do.

4
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,094
It isn't fair.

5
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:54,138
There's no reason.

6
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:59,393
But if we start asking why,
we'll go crazy.

7
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,846
Five minutes in the microwave.

8
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,050
Any one of them.
Five minutes and done.

9
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:27,109
Ready to eat.

10
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,841
Do you know how to make juice?

11
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:37,556
Microwave. Five minutes.

12
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,867
Here.

13
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,453

Hug a Friend.
Hug a Shrink.

19
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,602
Or work.
Work hard.

20
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:28,941
Work will save you. Work is the only thing
that will see you through this.

Don't mind him. He's just a guy
who's lost his wife.

22
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:47,376
What I think we really
need is a change.

23
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,589
Good idea. Take a couple of weeks off.
Get some sun. Take Jonah fishing.

24
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,386
No, a real change.

25
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,431
A new city.

26
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:05,102
Someplace where every time I go
around a corner, I don't think of Maggie.

Eventually, in a few months,
you'll start seeing women.

30
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,542
- You'll meet someone.
- Right, right.

31
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:31,212
Move on. Right.
That's what I'm gonna do

32
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,131
and then in a few months, boom,
I'll be fine. I'll just grow a new heart.

33
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,300
- Sam, I'm sorry.
- She didn't mean that.

34
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:40,305
I know, I know...
Look, it just doesn't happen twice.

- My father has electric trains.
- Really?

Thank you. Thank you.

77
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,625
Dad, mom knew.

78
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:00,046
- I don't see a ring, Annie.
- I don't have a ring yet.

79
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,048
Congratulations.

80
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,177
Bless you. Bless you.

81
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,764
- Oh, my goodness.
- Are you all right?

82
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,850
- It's nothing.
- Maybe it's the flowers.

83
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,770
- We'll move them.
- No! Don't touch them!

84
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,272
I feel terrible,
sneezing at a time like this.

85
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:20,399
This is a very
important moment for me.

86
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,526
He's allergic to everything.
Don't worry about it.

87
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,696
Bees. I'm allergic to bees.

88
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,741
Harold is allergic
to every type of bee.

89
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:31,900
We always have to carry a hypodermic
of adrenaline wherever we go.

90
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,660
If he eats even
one tiny piece of a nut...

91
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,751
My head swells up like
a watermelon, and I drop dead.

92
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,645
It's the same
with Harold and bees.

93
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:44,044
Your mother and I had salmon
at our wedding & I really think

94
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:45,792
that a wedding without cold salmon...

95
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,061
- I'm not allergic to salmon.
- Oh, he's not allergic to salmon.

96
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,764
I don't think,
but you never know.

97
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,434
- You never know.
- Harold wasn't always allergic to bees.

98
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,758
Oh honey, what a shame!

99
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:59,438
We had some champagne
and what did we use it for?

100

- And it was delicious.</i>

It was, wasn't it, Milton?

102
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,653
When are you getting married Annie?

103
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,989
- Eh, in early June, in the garden.
- Does it have to be in the garden?

104
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:12,743
<font color="#ff8a18">Annie</font>: Oh! What a great idea.
<font color="#ff8a18">Irene</font>: <i>What about Harold and bees?</i>

105
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:16,163
- I'm allergic to bees.
- We'll spray you.

106
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:20,084
Cold salmon, a lovely
cucumber salad, strawberries...

107
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:23,629
I'm afraid I am allergic
to strawberries.

108
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:25,923
Allergic to strawberries.

109
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:27,600
Is this all right with you?

110
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,595
Today, I consider myself
the luckiest...

00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:35,433
m-m-man on the f-f-face

00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:41,063
<i>- The Lou Gehrig line from...</i>
- Pride of the Yankees.

114
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:43,274
- Pride of the Yankees!
- Pride of the Yankees.

115
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,819
- It's baseball.
- A historical reference.

116
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:51,699
I would like to propose a toast
to my kid sister.

117
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,535
To Walter and my baby.

118
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,538
To Walter and Annie.

119
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:03,127
Everyone, please eat
before it gets cold.

120
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,465
Here it is.

121
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:11,594
The historical society wanted this
and I never would give it to them.

00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,846
<i>Oh, Mom!</i>

123
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,599
I noticed these things
are back in fashion.

124
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:21,062
- Grandmother's dress.
- Oh, honey.

125
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,606
He's a lovely man, Annie.

126
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:28,778
I know. He is wonderful, isn't he?
And he's such a wonderful athlete.

127
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,988
- Are his folks nice?
- You'll love them.

128
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,991
We're going down to D.C. tonight
to be with them Christmas morning.

129
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:38,245
- How did it happen?
- Well, it's silly, really.

130
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,248
I mean I'd seen him at the office.
Obviously, I'd seen him.

131
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:43,250
He's the associate publisher.

132
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:47,213
And then one day we both ordered sandwiches
from the same place and

133
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:51,509
he got my lettuce and tomato on whole wheat,
which, of course, he was allergic to...

134
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,844
and I got his lettuce
and tomato on white.

135
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,305
- How amazing!
- It is, isn't it?

136
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,516
You make a million decisions
that mean nothing

137
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,310
and then one day you order takeout,
and it changes your life.

138
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,521
Destiny takes a hand.

139
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,190
Mom, destiny is
something we've invented

140
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,069
because we can't stand the fact that
everything that happens is accidental.

141
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,130
Well, then, how do you
explain that you both ordered

142
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,000
exactly the same sandwich
except for the bread?

143
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,911
How many people in this world
like lettuce and tomato

144
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,914
without something else like tuna?

145
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:26,711
Well, it wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.

146
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:30,881
I was in Atlantic City with my family.
Cliff was a waiter.

147
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:35,720
He wasn't even supposed to work
that night, and suppose he hadn't?

148
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:39,557
He asked me to take a midnight walk
on the Steel Pier.

149
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:44,103
I've probably told you this
a million times, but I don't care.

150
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,605
Then he held my hand.

151
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,799
At one point, I looked down
and I couldn't tell

152
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,253
which fingers were his
and which were mine.

153
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:55,239
And I knew.

154
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:58,743
- What?
- You know.

155
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:02,204
- What?
- Magic.

156
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,915
It was magic.

157
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,542
Magic?

158
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,796
I knew we'd be together forever and
that everything would be wonderful...

159
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,632
just the way you feel about Walter.

160
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:18,763
Walter? It's quite
a formal name, isn't it?

161
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:22,350
One of the things I truly knew
was that your father and I

162
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:25,144
were going to have
a wonderful time in...

163
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:28,564
- the sack, I believe you call it.
- Mom!

164
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,000
Of course, it took
several years

165
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:32,901
before everything worked
like clockwork in that department.

166
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:35,029
So, don't be worried
if it takes a while.

167
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,574
- Well, we already...
- Fine. Fine. Fiddle-de-dee.

168
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,702
- How's it working?
- Like clockwork.

169
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,997
Oh, honey.

170
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,796
- It's a sign.
- You don't believe in signs.

171
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:02,056
They loved you! I told you they
would love you, and they loved you!

172
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,850
- I love you.
- I love you, Walter.

173
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:10,398
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?

174
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,817
Nope.

175
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,860
Not even when you were young?

176
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:17,196
Nope, not even when I was young.

177
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:21,033
You sure you don't
want to drive with me?

178
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:23,994
How will I get back
to Baltimore on Friday?

179
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:28,499
I forgot the present. Walter, I left your
stepmother's present inside by accident.

180
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,925
I swear when we're
old and gray,

181
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:31,849
you're gonna have to
remind me to put my teeth in

182
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,200
and I'll be walking
all over town,

183
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:35,448
smacking my gums together
and not even noticing.

184
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,677
- I'll wait.
- You'll wait? Oh! Right.

185
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,847
No, don't wait Walter. Really, it's silly.
You go ahead. We're late anyway.

186
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,141
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

187
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:48,519
<i> Sleigh bells jing-a-ling
Ring-ting-ting-a-ling too </i>

188
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:50,521
<i> Horses, horses, horses, horses </i>

189
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:52,565
<i> It's lovely weather
for a sleigh ride together with you </i>

190
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,567
<i> Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap </i>

191
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,695
<i> The snow is falling
and friends are calling, Yoo-hoo </i>

192
00:12:57,737 --> 00:13:00,948
<i> Friends are calling, Yoo-hoo
Ding-a-ling-a-ling </i>

193
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:03,701
<i> Horses, horses, horses
Horses, horses, horses </i>

194
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:05,369
<i> Horses, horses, horses </i>

195
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:09,081
<i> Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way </i>

196
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:13,252
<i> Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh </i>

197
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:15,338
<i> Jingle bells, jin... </i>

198
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,757
- Horses, horses, horses
- <i>Welcome back to "You and Your Emotions"</i>

199
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,800
- Laughing all the way
- <i>I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone....</i>

200
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:21,620
<i>broadcasting live across America</i>

201
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:24,167
<i>from the top of the
Sears Tower in Chicago.</i>

202
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:28,517
<i>Tonight we're talking
about wishes and dreams.</i>

203
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:31,187
- <i>What's your wish this Christmas Eve?</i>
- What's your wish?

204
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,940
- <i>Maybe the best gift you can give your...</i>
- My wish is to turn the radio station.

205
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:38,903
<i>Subject of this evening's medical
update is "You and Your Spleen."</i>

206
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,613
- <i>and your host is Dr...</i>
- Not on your life.

207
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:45,326
<i>Coming up, "Jingle Bells" backwards,
sung by the New Jersey...</i>

208
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:49,664
<i>- Seattle, go ahead.
- Hello, this is Jonah...</i>

209
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:51,332
<i>No last names, Jonah.</i>

210
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,752
<i>You sound younger than
our usual callers. How old are you?</i>

211
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:57,672
<i>- I'm eight.
- Eight. How come you're up so late?</i>

212
00:13:57,755 --> 00:14:01,509
<i>- It's not that late in Seattle.
- Of course. You're absolutely right.</i>

213
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,803
<i>Alright, what's your
Christmas wish, Jonah?</i>

214
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:07,848
<i>It's not for me. It's for my dad.
I think he needs a new wife.</i>

215
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,685
<i>- You don't like the one he has now?
- He doesn't have one now.</i>

216
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,353
<i>That's the problem.</i>

217
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,897
<i>- Where's your mom?
- She died.</i>

218
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,777
- Oh... I'm so sorry to hear that.
- <i>Well, who can believe this?</i>

219
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:22,863
<i>I've been pretty sad,
but I think my dad's worse.</i>

220
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:25,491
<i>Have you talked
to your dad about this?</i>

221
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,785
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

222
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:31,414
<i>- It's like it makes him sadder.
- I can understand that.</i>

223
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:34,083
<i>- Jonah, is your dad home right now?
- Yeah.</i>

224
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,795
<i>- What's he doing? Is he busy?
- Not really. He's out on the deck.</i>

225
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:42,133
<i>I'm sure that I can help, but I'm
going to need you to help me help him.</i>

226
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,301
<i>- Wretched woman!
- Bring your dad to the phone.</i>

227
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:47,972
<i>- Hang up, Jonah! Don't listen to her.
- No way. He'd kill me.</i>

228
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:50,599
<i>Trust me, Jonah.
He won't be angry...</i>

229
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:53,185
<i>when he realizes
how concerned you are about him.</i>

230
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,687
Wanna bet?

231
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,648
<i>Okay, if I get yelled at, I'm never
goinna listen to your show again.</i>

232
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,984
<i>Okay, fair enough.</i>

233
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,654
- Dad?
- Yeah?

234
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:06,907
There's someone
on the phone for you.

235
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:11,996
<i>- His name's Sam.
- Sam.</i>

236
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,041
<i>If you've just tuned in,
this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone</i>

237
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,168
<i>and tonight's topic is
"Your Wishes and Dreams"</i>

238
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:21,005
- I got it.
- <i>...and we're on the line now
with someone from Seattle.</i>

239
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:22,590
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Sam.</i>

240
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,384
<i>This is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone
on Network America.</i>

241
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:30,848
Okay... what are you selling tonight?
Micro hibachis or Ginza knives?

242
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,185
<i>No, I'm not selling anything.
I just want to help.</i>

243
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,187
<i>I want you to know
that your son called</i>

244
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:40,191
<i>and he asked me for some advice
on how you might find a new wife.</i>

245
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:45,613
<i>- Who is this?
- Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America</i>

246
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,616
- <i>...and you are on the air.</i>
- You called a radio station?

247
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:53,454
- <i>Sam? Sam? Sam, are you with me?</i>
- Yeah. Yes.

248
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:57,750
<i>Your son feels that since your wife's
death you've been very, very unhappy</i>

249
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,379
<i>and he's genuinely worried about you.</i>

250
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,923
Oh, hey, get out here.
Get out here.

251
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,300
Come on now, I'm not gonna
go through this alone.

252
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:10,429
<i>I think it's very hard for him
to talk to you about all this</i>

253
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:12,000
<i>and I thought maybe
you and I could talk.</i>

254
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:14,223
<i>It would make Jonah
feel a little better.</i>

255
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,812
<i>- Sam?
- Talk to her, Dad. She's a doctor.</i>

256
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,815
Of what?
Her first name could be Doctor.

257
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,401
- Please?
- <i>Sam?</i>

258
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:27,029
<i>Sam, it's his Christmas wish.</i>

259
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:30,908
- Okay.
- <i>Okay, good.</i>

260
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,494
<i>Now, I know this is difficult.</i>

261
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:36,580
<i>But how long ago
did your wife die?</i>

262
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:39,166
About a year and a half ago.

263
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,294
<i>Oh... Have you had
any relationships since?</i>

264
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,465
<i>- Nope.
- No?</i>

265
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:48,342
<i>Why not?</i>

266
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:53,139
Marcia... or should
I call you Dr. Fieldstone?

267
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:55,725
- <i>Dr. Marcia.</i>
- Dr. Marcia.

268
00:16:55,808 --> 00:17:00,146
<i>- I don't mean to be rude.
- Oh and I don't wanna invade your privacy.</i>

269
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,565
- <i>Oh, sure you do.</i>
- Sure you do.

270
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:05,943
<i>Go on, Sam.
I'm listening.</i>

271
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:07,862
<i>Sam?</i>

272
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:13,451
We had a pretty
tough time there at first.

273
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:16,120
But we're dealing with it

274
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:21,208
and Jonah and I will
get along just fine again...

275
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:24,337
as soon as I break his radio.

276
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,841
<i>I have no doubt that
you're a wonderful father.</i>

277
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:32,678
<i>- You can tell a lot from a person's voice.
- You certainly can.</i>

278
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:37,433
<i>But something must be missing if
Jonah still feels that you're under a cloud.</i>

279
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:40,811
<i>Just a few questions:
Are you sleeping at night?</i>

280
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,981
- <i>He doesn't sleep at all.</i>
- How do you know that?

281
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,816
I live here, dad.

282
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:52,907
Look, it's Christmas.

283
00:17:56,202 --> 00:18:00,331
Maggie, my wife...

284
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:02,875
She really did it.

285
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,877
I mean, she loved...

286
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:08,422
She made everything beautiful

287
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,300
<i>and it's just tough
this time of year</i>

288
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,011
and any kid needs a mother.

289
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:21,018
<i>Could it be that you need someone
just as much as Jonah does?</i>

290
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,314
Yes.

291
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:28,734
<i>Don't answer that. Let's get into that
right after these messages.</i>

292
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:31,070
<i>Sam, Jonah, don't go away.</i>

293
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:35,449
<i>If you've just tuned in,
we're talking to "Sleepless in Seattle"</i>

294
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:39,620
<i>and we'll be right back after this break
with your listener response.</i>

295
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:41,539
What is she talking about?

296
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,709
This is when other people get to call in
and dump on what you said.

297
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:50,297
Oh, oh. This is really fun,
and helpful.

298
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,514
I'll bet he's tall
with a cute butt.

299
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:00,933
Bet he hasn't bathed in weeks
and he stinks.

300
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:03,394
Harriet, shut up.
Hi. Can I help you?

301
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:05,229
Tea with the bag out.

302
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:07,550
You know, maybe I'll just
hustle myself out to Seattle,

303
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:09,263
give him a little gift
for New Year's Eve.

304
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah, you go on out there if you want to,
but don't open his refrigerator.

305
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:15,250
They don't cover anything
when they put it in the fridge.

306
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:18,253
They just stick it in there and
leave it till it walks out by itself.

307
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:22,025
What I'm saying is, I wouldn't kick this
guy out of my bed for eating crackers.

308
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:23,900
- <i>You know what I'm saying?
- Sixty-five cents.</i>

309
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:27,585
<i>Let's take a call
before we get back to Sleepless.</i>

310
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,755
<i>Knoxville, Tennessee,
you're on the air. Talk to me.</i>

311
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:35,593
<i>Yes, I would just like to know
where I could get this man's address.</i>

312
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,845
<i>- Honey, get in line.
- We don't give that information.</i>

313
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,597
<i>Next caller, go ahead.</i>

314
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:44,185
<i>If there was one question
I was allowed to ask...</i>

315
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,479
Oh, go ahead.

316
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:50,649
<i>People who truly loved once
are far more likely to love again.</i>

317
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:53,300
<i>Sam, do you think that
there's someone out there</i>

318
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:55,000
<i>you could love
as much as your wife?</i>

319
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:02,078
<i>Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
that's hard to imagine.</i>

320
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:05,498
<i>Hmm...
What are you going to do?</i>

321
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:10,628
Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning.

322
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,963
Breathe in and out all day long.

323
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,960
<i>Then, after a while,
I won't have to remind myself</i>

324
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:22,139
<i>to get out of bed in the morning
and breathe in and out.</i>

325
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:28,062
And then after a while,
I won't have to think about how...

326
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:31,315
I had it great and perfect
for a while.

327
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:36,153
<i>Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife?</i>

328
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:38,823
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>

329
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:44,370
<i>Oh, well, it was a...</i>

330
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,372
<i>It was a million
tiny little things.</i>

331
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:51,502
<i>When you added them all up, it just
meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

332
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:55,715
<i>And I knew it. I knew it
the very first time I touched her.</i>

333
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:58,759
It was like coming home...

334
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:02,013
only to no home I'd ever known.

335
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:05,099
I was just taking her hand

336
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:08,519
to help her out of a car

337
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:10,104
and I knew it.

338
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:13,774
<i>It was like...</i>

339
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:16,444
- Magic.
- <i>Magic.</i>

340
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:20,156
<i>Well, folks,
it's time to wrap it up.</i>

341
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,867
<i>I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone
in Chicago</i>

342
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:27,413
<i>and to all my listeners,
a magical and merry Christmas.</i>

343
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:32,418
<i>And to you, Sleepless in Seattle,
we hope you'll call again soon</i>

344
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,713
<i>- ...and let us know how it's going.
- Oh, you can count on it.</i>

345
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:41,385
<i> When you find me </i>

346
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:46,057
<i> I know somewhere... </i>

347
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,604
<i> Over the rainbow </i>

348
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:58,277
<i> The bluebirds glide </i>

349
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:06,160
<i> Birds fly </i>

350
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:10,581
<i> Over the rainbow </i>

351
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:15,920
<i> Why, then, oh, why </i>

352
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:20,299
<i> Can't I? </i>

353
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,557
<i>This man sells the greatest soup
you've ever eaten</i>

354
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:30,810
<i>and he is the meanest man
in America.</i>

355
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:34,522
<i>I feel very strongly about this, Becky.
It's not just about the soup.</i>

356
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,732
- <i>Do it. What else?</i>
- New Year's Eve.

357
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:39,276
- Please don't make me write it.
- <i>Listen to this.</i>

358
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:42,446
"Phone service in the greater Chicago
area was tied up for two hours on...

359
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,032
Christmas Eve when some kid
calls a phone-in radio show...

360
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:47,034
and says that his dad
needs a new wife.

361
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:51,539
Two thousand women called the station
asking for the guy's number.

362
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:54,875
I heard it. This kid calls up
and says, "My dad needs a wife."

363
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:57,333
and this shrink practically
forces the guy on to the phone

364
00:22:57,357 --> 00:22:58,546
and says, "Do you wanna talk about it?"

365
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,132
He says, "No,
as a matter of fact, I don't."

366
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:02,597
And then, suddenly,
for no reason at all,

367
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:04,900
he starts to talk about how
much he loved his wife

368
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:06,550
and how he just
fell in love with her...

369
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,300
like he was one
of those cows in Michigan.

370
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:11,559
- What cows in Michigan?
- It was on 60 Minutes.

371
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,811
There were those cows
that got zapped by stray voltage.

372
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:16,522
No one knows why and
maybe it was Wisconsin.

373
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:20,901
But anyway, I was listening to him
talk about how much he loved his wife

374
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:23,404
and suddenly I was crying.

375
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,640
It's like what happens when
I watch those phone company ads.

376
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:27,300
I don't have to see the whole thing,
just the part where

377
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:29,140
the daughter gives the mother
the refrigerator

378
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,780
with the big red bow on it.

379
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:35,082
Yes, the Polaroid commercial: Two 5-year-olds
at their grandfather's birthday party.

380
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,084
- They're making the album.
- With the glue.

381
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:39,837
<i>That kills me.</i>

382
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,381
You should write
something about this.

383
00:23:42,423 --> 00:23:44,967
- About what?
- <i>Whatever it is.</i>

384
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:48,804
I'll tell you what it is. 2,000 women
calling a radio station for a husband.

385
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:50,806
There are a lot of desperate women
out there lookin' for love.

386
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,808
Especially over a certain age.

387
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:56,103
You know, it's easier to be killed by a terrorist
than it is to get married over the age of 40.

388
00:23:56,187 --> 00:23:58,105
That is not true.
That statistic is not true.

389
00:23:58,189 --> 00:24:00,358
That's right. It's not true.
But it feels true.

390
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,360
It feels true
because it is true.

391
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:05,071
There's practically a whole book
about how that statistic is not true.

392
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:08,199
- Calm down. You brought it up.
- I did not, Wyatt.

393
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,381
Did you even read that book?

394
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:11,452
Did anyone read that
book all the way through?

395
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:14,622
Are you two finished?
Fine. Now, where were we?

396
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:18,876
If someone is a widower,
why do they say that he was widowed?

397
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:21,712
Why don't they say
he was widowered?

398
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:26,300
I was just wondering.

399
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:28,344
What was that about up there?

400
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:31,347
- What was what?
- What's with you?

401
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:35,226
- Nothing's with me.
- Something's with you.

402
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:38,771
- What are you saying?
- Whatever it is, you can tell me.

403
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,356
Sleepless in Seattle?

404
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:43,067
That's what she called him on the show
because he can't sleep.

405
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,237
And now 2,000 women
want his number.

406
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,739
The guy could be
a crackhead, a transvestite,

407
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:52,076
a flasher, a junkie,
a chain-saw murderer

408
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,287
or someone really sick,
someone like my Rick.

409
00:24:57,123 --> 00:25:00,084
- Actually, he sounded nice.
- Oh?

410
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:05,506
Oh, really?
Now we're getting down to it.

411
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,509
Please. Becky,
I'm madly in love with Walter.

412
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,762
He did the craziest thing
the other night. What was that?

413
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,768
Oh, it was so funny.
We were hysterical. What was that?

414
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:34,660
You know, I'm thinking, I've got to go
up to Boston for the A.A.P. convention, right?

415
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:37,955
Then, I got to visit Winston-Hughes
about switching over our computers.

416
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:43,461
<i>But why don't we meet in New York
for Valentine's Day weekend?</i>

417
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:46,672
Walter, I'd love to!

418
00:25:46,756 --> 00:25:49,467
We can stay at the Plaza.

419
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:51,927
Ice-stake in Central Park.

420
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:54,263
Register.

421
00:25:54,347 --> 00:25:56,057
Register?

422
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,770
You know, for dishes,
glasses, silver, everything.

423
00:26:03,314 --> 00:26:04,732
How about it?

424
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:10,863
I'll take you to Chinatown
for dim sum.

425
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:13,908
- Does it have wheat in it?
- I don't think so.

426
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,414
<i>Dim sum, dim sum</i>

427
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:27,254
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

428
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:31,676
five, four, three, two, one!

429
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:36,347
Hey, Jonah. Wake up. Wake up, man.
The ball's droppin'.

430
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,973
<i>Happy new year!</i>

431
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:47,858
<i>Okay, pal. I got ya.</i>

432
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,193
It's okay.

433
00:26:49,235 --> 00:26:51,278
There we go.

434
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:27,023
Happy new year.

435
00:27:27,106 --> 00:27:29,066
Happy new year.

436
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:34,572
Kiss Howard.

437
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:36,741
Good night, Howard.

438
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:56,260
<i> Sometimes I wonder </i>

439
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:59,513
<i> Why I spend </i>

440
00:27:59,597 --> 00:28:03,934
<i> The lonely night </i>

441
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:07,480
<i> Dreaming of a song </i>

442
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:10,149
<i> The melody </i>

443
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:13,819
<i> Haunts my reverie </i>

444
00:28:13,903 --> 00:28:19,116
<i> And I am once again with you </i>

445
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,787
<i> When our love was new </i>

446
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,542
<i> And each kiss an inspiration </i>

447
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:35,716
<i> But that was long ago </i>

448
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,720
<i> Now my consolation </i>

449
00:28:39,804 --> 00:28:44,684
<i> Is in the stardust of a song </i>

450
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:50,356
<i> Beside the garden wall </i>

451
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:54,777
<i> When stars are bright </i>

452
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,364
<i> You are in my arms </i>

453
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:01,325
<i> The nightingale </i>

454
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:04,787
<i> Tells his fairy tale </i>

455
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,833
<i> Of paradise where roses bloom </i>

456
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,002
Can I have half your beer?

457
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:14,296
Sure. Go ahead.

458
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:19,552
What did I used to say?

459
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:21,804
"Here's looking at you"?

460
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:23,806
"Here's mud in your eye"?

461
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:26,183
"Here's to us."

462
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:30,604
You used to say, "Here's to us."

463
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:38,446
Oh, babe.
I miss you so much it hurts.

464
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:57,965
- What do you want to do?
- We'll tell him when he gets here.

465
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:00,301
You want to tell him.
I don't mind telling him.

466
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:03,095
- She's here.
- She's back. She has another idea.

467
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:05,139
I don't need...
<i>Sam! ... <i>
Claire, how are you?

468
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:07,850
<i>...I'm so glad you're here.<i>
I heard you on the radio.

469
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:11,437
- I told everyone about it.
- Ah... we already knew.

470
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,772
- What? How did you...
- Grace.

471
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:15,024
The dispatcher?
All of Seattle knows.

472
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:17,526
I was brushing my teeth
and suddenly there you were !

473
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:20,696
I couldn't believe my ears.
I called my mother in Las Vegas.

474
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,576
I said, Mother, turn on the radio.
That's my architect."

475
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,496
You know, it is so nice

476
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:31,957
when a man can
express his feelings.

477
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,919
- It's wonderful.
- Yeah, I wish I could express my feelings.

478
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:38,800
- Yeah.. so Claire, is you problem...
- I was just tossing and turning last night.

479
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:40,250
You know what that's like Sam

480
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:42,950
because I realized
I'm never going to

481
00:30:42,951 --> 00:30:45,427
fit my platters in that
refrigerator we ordered

482
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,749
and when I give parties,
I always put in platters.

483
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,129
So, I thought I would get the Sub-Zero
refrigerator instead and the only problem...

484
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:53,521
We have to redo all the cabinets.

485
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:56,982
- We're gonna... We'll be into this wall.
- That's a bearing wall.

486
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:59,402
That's a delay, Claire, of...

487
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:01,404
- Two, three...
- Five, six...

488
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:03,447
- Twelve weeks.
- I don't mind.

489
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:05,992
The important thing
is to get it right.

490
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:08,035
- Absolutely.
- Your words.

491
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,830
I've got to rush.
La decorateur calls.

492
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:13,124
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

493
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:18,963
Well, this is fate.
She's divorced,

494
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:21,215
we don't want to redo the cabinets,
and you need a wife.

495
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:23,968
What do they call that
when everything intersects?

496
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,012
The Bermuda Triangle.

497
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:39,275
And here's another one.
You got room for one more here?

498
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:41,318
There you go.
You all right there?

499
00:31:41,402 --> 00:31:45,364
- Look at this, Dad. They're all for you.
- Yes, sir. There you go.

500
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:51,454
"Sleepless in Seattle.
In care of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"?

501
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:52,520
If you're having trouble sleeping,

502
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:55,940
you might wanna try drinking
a glass of water from the other side.

503
00:31:56,334 --> 00:31:58,794
- I thought that was for hiccups.
- Does it work for hiccups?

504
00:31:58,878 --> 00:32:02,590
For hiccups, take a spoonful of sugar
and hold it in your mouth for a minute.

505
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:06,510
- Really?
- Thank you.

506
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:08,888
<i>What possessed you
to give them our address?</i>

507
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:12,058
They called and asked for it.

508
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:14,310
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle...

509
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:18,189
You're the most attractive man
I ever laid ears on."

510
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,901
Wait, wait, wait. They called?
How did they get our number?

511
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:24,070
Let me guess.
You gave it to them.

512
00:32:24,153 --> 00:32:27,198
You have to give them your phone number,
or they won't let you on the air.

513
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:30,201
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle,
I live in Tulsa."

514
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:33,704
<i>- Where's that?
- It's in Oklahoma.</i>

515
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:36,540
- Do you know where Oklahoma is?
- Somewhere in the middle.

516
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,800
I'm not even gonna think about
what they're not teaching you in school.

517
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:41,099
I'm not gonna think about it.

518
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,175
Yeah, it's somewhere
in the middle

519
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:43,449
and generally speaking, I think

520
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:46,953
we should rule out anyone
that doesn't live near here.

521
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:49,428
She's willing to fly anywhere.

522
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:54,725
Well, she looks like my third grade teacher..
and I hated my third grade teacher.

523
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:58,854
Wait a minute.
She is my third grade teacher!

524
00:32:58,938 --> 00:33:03,734
- Aren't you gonna read any of these?
- This is not how it's done.

525
00:33:03,776 --> 00:33:07,113
I'd much rather
just see somebody I like...

526
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:10,533
and get a feeling about them...

527
00:33:10,616 --> 00:33:12,743
and ask them
if they want to have a drink.

528
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:14,745
- Or a slice of pizza?
- Not dinner.

529
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:16,256
Not necessarily on
the first date

530
00:33:16,257 --> 00:33:19,251
because halfway through dinner you could be
really sorry you asked them to dinner.

531
00:33:19,252 --> 00:33:21,254
Whereas, if it's just a drink...

532
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:24,130
if you like them,
you could always ask them to dinner.

533
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:26,757
But if not, you can just say,
"Well, that was great."

534
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:31,345
And then you go home.
See what I mean?

535
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:33,597
I wonder if
it still works this way.

536
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:37,977
- It doesn't. They ask you.
- I'm starting to notice that.

537
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:42,648
If you get a new wife, I guess
you'll have sex with her, huh?

538
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:45,234
I certainly hope so.

539
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:49,739
- Will she scratch up your back?
- What?

540
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:54,577
In movies, women are always scratching
up the man's back and screaming
and stuff when they're having sex.

541
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,538
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

542
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,790
Oh, Jed's got cable.

543
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,378
Hand me that towel
behind you, please.

544
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:11,010
- Thank you.
- I need it too.

545
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:14,805
Here. Let me get you.
Jed's got cable. C'mon -

546
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:17,475
<i> Another bride </i>

547
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:20,186
<i> Another groom </i>

548
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:25,649
<i> Another sunny honeymoon </i>

549
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:28,486
<i> Another season </i>

550
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:33,199
<i> And that's the reason 
 for makin' whoopee </i>

551
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:53,219
<i> When the sun is high 
 in the afternoon sky </i>

552
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:57,682
<i> You can always 
 find something to do </i>

553
00:34:57,723 --> 00:35:03,646
<i> But from dusk till dawn 
 as the clock ticks on </i>

554
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:10,486
<i> Something happens to you </i>

555
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:15,074
<i> In the wee small hours </i>

556
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:18,786
<i> Of the morning </i>

557
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:22,540
<i> While the whole wide world </i>

558
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:26,711
<i> Is fast asleep </i>

559
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:30,589
<i> You lie awake </i>

560
00:35:30,673 --> 00:35:34,677
<i> And think about the boy </i>

561
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,596
<i> And never ever think </i>

562
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,893
<i> Of counting sheep </i>

563
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:45,479
<i>Welcome back to the
"Best of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"...</i>

564
00:35:45,563 --> 00:35:48,315
<i>clinical psychologist
and the friend you never had.</i>

565
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:52,403
<i>- Remember Marooned in Miami?
- He says he doesn't love me anymore.</i>

566
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:55,448
<i>Why would you want to be
with someone who doesn't love you?</i>

567
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:57,491
<i>Disappointed in Denver.</i>

568
00:35:57,575 --> 00:36:01,662
<i>Every time I come close to orgasm,
he goes to make himself a sandwich.</i>

569
00:36:01,746 --> 00:36:03,873
<i>Why don't you make him
a sandwich beforehand?</i>

570
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:05,875
<i>Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

571
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:11,297
<i>Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning</i>

572
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,176
<i>and breathe in and out all day long.</i>

573
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:19,597
<i>Then after a while,
I won't have to remind myself</i>

574
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,435
<i>to get out of bed in the morning
and breathe in and out.</i>

575
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:31,442
<i>And then after a while
I won't have to think about how</i>

576
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:35,446
<i>I had it great and perfect
for a while.</i>

577
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:40,242
<i>Sam, tell me what was
so special about your wife?</i>

578
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:43,287
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>

579
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:48,626
<i>Oh, well, it was a...</i>

580
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:50,670
<i>It was a million
tiny little things.</i>

581
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:55,675
<i>When you added them all up, it just
meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

582
00:36:55,758 --> 00:37:00,429
<i>And I knew it. I knew it
the very first time I touched her.</i>

583
00:37:00,513 --> 00:37:02,848
<i>It was like coming home...</i>

584
00:37:02,932 --> 00:37:06,143
<i>only to no home I'd ever known.</i>

585
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:09,230
<i>I was just taking her hand</i>

586
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:11,982
<i>to help her out of a car</i>

587
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:15,319
<i>and I knew it.</i>

588
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:18,072
<i>It was like....</i>

589
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:20,074
<i>magic.</i>

590
00:37:41,554 --> 00:37:45,474
Well, I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.
I really do. Are you happily married?

591
00:37:45,558 --> 00:37:48,519
- What?
- I mean, why did you get married?

592
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:50,938
Was it all trumpets
and fireworks?

593
00:37:51,022 --> 00:37:54,191
I got married because Betsy said
we had to break up or get married.

594
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:55,943
So, we got married.

595
00:37:56,819 --> 00:37:58,446
But when you first met her,

596
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:01,032
did you believe she was
the only person for you?

597
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:04,285
That in some mystical,
cosmic way it was fated?

598
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:08,205
Annie, when you're
attracted to someone,

599
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:11,208
it just means that your subconscious
is attracted to their subconscious.

600
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,127
Subconsciously.

601
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,396
So, what we think of as fate

602
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,702
is just two neuroses knowing
they're a perfect match.

603
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:20,259
I don't even know him.

604
00:38:20,343 --> 00:38:25,181
I am having all of these fantasies
about some man I have never even met,

605
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:27,266
who lives in Seattle!

606
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,435
It rains nine months
of the year in Seattle.

607
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:34,482
I know! I know!
I do not want to move to Seattle.

608
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:40,863
But what I really don't want
to do is end up always wondering...

609
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:44,241
what might have happened and
knowing I could have done something.

610
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:46,535
What do you think?

611
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,537
It's just cold feet, isn't it?

612
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:51,666
Everybody panics before
they get married. Didn't you?

613
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,418
- Yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.

614
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,838
Thank you very much, Dennis. I feel so
much better just having blown this off.

615
00:38:57,922 --> 00:38:59,256
Anytime.

616
00:38:59,298 --> 00:39:03,177
Sandy has a girlfriend, Glenda.
She's a weight lifter.

617
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,262
It's not like her neck
is bigger than her head.

618
00:39:05,346 --> 00:39:09,392
No, no, no... I'm not asking you to set me up.
I don't need your help with that.

619
00:39:09,475 --> 00:39:12,561
I just want to know
what it's like out there.

620
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:15,147
That's what I'm trying to tell you,
what women are lookin' for.

621
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:17,733
Pecs and a cute butt.

622
00:39:17,817 --> 00:39:19,775
What, you mean, like,
"He has the cutest butt''?

623
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:20,444
Yeah.

624
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:23,364
- Where did I hear that recently?
- Everywhere.

625
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:26,117
You can't even turn on the news
nowadays without hearing about...

626
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:29,078
how some babe thought
some guy's butt was cute.

627
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:32,581
Who the first woman to say this was,
I don't know. But somehow it caught on.

628
00:39:32,665 --> 00:39:34,834
So how's my butt?

629
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:38,262
Not bad.

630
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,486
- Really?
- Yeah.

631
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:41,749
- Is it cute though?
- Hmm... I don't know.

632
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,551
Are we grading on a curve?

633
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,303
When's the last time
you were out there?

634
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:52,351
Jimmy Carter, 1978.

635
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:56,689
Things are
a little different now.

636
00:39:56,772 --> 00:40:00,151
First you have to be friends.
You have to like each other.

637
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:04,113
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.

638
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:06,782
Then you have tests.
Then you get to do it with a condom.

639
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:08,993
The good news is,
you split the check.

640
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:12,580
I don't think I could
let a woman pay for dinner.

641
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:15,041
Great. They'll throw
a parade in your honor.

642
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:17,424
You'll be 'man of the year'
in Seattle magazine.

643
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,547
Tiramisu.

644
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,508
- What is tiramisu?
- You'll find out.

645
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:26,260
- What is it?
- You'll see.

646
00:40:26,344 --> 00:40:29,221
Some woman will want me to do it to her.
I'm not going to know what it is.

647
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:30,723
You'll love it.

648
00:40:31,724 --> 00:40:34,352
This is going to be tough.
Tough, tough.

649
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:36,520
This is going to be much tougher
than I thought it was going to be.

650
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:39,940
How about that decorator
on the Bennett job?

651
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:43,444
- Victoria?
- Yeah, she's perk.

652
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,655
- Oh, I don't know, I...
- Come on!

653
00:40:45,738 --> 00:40:47,365
I'm far away from that.

654
00:40:47,448 --> 00:40:49,784
- I'm just assembling notes.
- Notes.

655
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:52,536
- How would I do that?
- What do you mean? Call her up.

656
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:54,664
You say, "Come on, let's get together.
We'll look at swatches."

657
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:57,541
Call her on the phone?
Say, "Come, let's look at swatches"?

658
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:00,419
- Yeah, you know, color schemes.
- She's not gonna see right through that?

659
00:41:00,503 --> 00:41:03,422
You don't do it like I do it.
You do it in your own suave way.

660
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:06,175
Think Cary Grant.

661
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:09,930
Cary Grant would call up and say,
"Come over & look at my swatches"?

662
00:41:09,931 --> 00:41:11,732
- How do you know? Maybe he did.
- He didn't !

663
00:41:12,296 --> 00:41:13,808
I know he didn't do it in the movies.

664
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:15,434
<i>Gunga Din?</i>

665
00:41:15,518 --> 00:41:17,812
<i>Gunga Din is not
a swatch kind of movie.</i>

666
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:20,356
Who knows what
he did in real life?

667
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:23,317
- But he did that with Dyan Cannon?
- Oh yeah, sure.

668
00:41:23,401 --> 00:41:25,903
"Hello, Dyan.
Take a look at these swatches."

669
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,049
Jonah, I'm home.

670
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:51,429
Hey, Jonah!

671
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:11,949
Hi, Dad. This is Jessica.

672
00:42:14,577 --> 00:42:17,121
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Jessica.

673
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:21,250
<i>Dad, this is amazing. If you play this
backwards, it says, "Paul is dead.''</i>

674
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:24,670
Yeah, I know.

675
00:42:24,754 --> 00:42:26,505
How do you know?

676
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:31,385
Dad, could you shut the door?

677
00:42:31,469 --> 00:42:33,637
Sure. Sure.

678
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:35,389
H and G.

679
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:39,518
Hi and good-bye.

680
00:43:24,647 --> 00:43:28,985
<i> I'm back in the saddle again </i>

681
00:43:29,068 --> 00:43:32,822
<i> Out where a friend is a friend </i>

682
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:37,535
<i> Where the longhorn cattle feed 
 on the lowly jimsonweed </i>

683
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:41,622
<i> Back in the saddle again </i>

684
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:45,918
<i> Ridin' the range once more </i>

685
00:43:46,002 --> 00:43:49,880
<i> Totin' my old.44 </i>

686
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:52,174
<i> Where you sleep out every night... </i>

687
00:43:52,258 --> 00:43:55,553
Hello, Victoria?

688
00:43:55,594 --> 00:43:59,682
This is Sam Baldwin.
I don't know if you remember me, but...

689
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:03,602
Oh, great. Hi.

690
00:44:03,686 --> 00:44:07,732
I was wondering if...

691
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:11,944
if you would like
to have a drink with me?

692
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:13,446
Dinner?

693
00:44:15,156 --> 00:44:18,451
Dinner would be even better.

694
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:22,038
Friday would be great.
Yeah. How...

695
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:24,582
I hear that's a good place.

696
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:31,839
How... 7:30 would be fine
and I'll...

697
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:37,011
Okay, I'll meet you there. Okay.

698
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:40,723
Umm... so, it's Friday

699
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:43,100
at 7:30 for dinner.

700
00:44:43,142 --> 00:44:44,602
Great.

701
00:44:46,145 --> 00:44:47,730
Me too. Bye.

702
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:52,777
<i> Back in the saddle again </i>

703
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:57,114
<i>Are you in love with him?</i>

704
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:01,494
<i>I'm not now.</i>

705
00:45:02,328 --> 00:45:06,457
Now those were the days
when people knew how to be in love.

706
00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:08,626
- You're a basket case.
- They knew it.

707
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:13,964
Time, distance, nothing could separate
them, because they knew it was right.

708
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:17,093
- It was real. It was...
- A movie.

709
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:19,095
That's your problem.
You don't want to be in love.

710
00:45:19,178 --> 00:45:21,305
You want to be
in love in a movie.

711
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:22,973
Read it to me.

712
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:28,813
Dear Sleepless and Son, I have never
written a letter like this in my life."

713
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:32,400
That's what everyone writes at
the beginning of letters to strangers.

714
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:35,778
I know that.
You think I don't know that?

715
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:38,614
What about Walter?

716
00:45:38,698 --> 00:45:42,660
Walter. Oh, I would
give anything to marry Walter.

717
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:44,870
He's so unexpected.

718
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:49,959
You think you can tell what he's like
by just looking at him, but you can't.

719
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:52,503
I should write something
in this about magic.

720
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:54,213
- What?
- Something.

721
00:45:54,296 --> 00:45:58,009
What if I never meet him? What if this
man is my destiny and I never meet him?

722
00:45:58,092 --> 00:46:01,012
Your destiny can be your doom.
Look at me and Rick.

723
00:46:01,095 --> 00:46:03,055
I want to meet you..."

724
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:06,517
- <i>How about the top of the Empire State Building?</i>
- On the top of the Empire State Building.

725
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:08,352
<i>Oh yes, that's perfect.</i>

726
00:46:08,436 --> 00:46:10,855
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

727
00:46:12,148 --> 00:46:16,277
I'll be in New York with Walter.
I can squeeze it in.

728
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,155
I'll be in New York with Walter.

729
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:28,205
Do you want to
hear about destiny?

730
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:32,209
If I hadn't married Martin, I wouldn't
have got the house with the dead tree.

731
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:34,712
On account of which,
I got divorced.

732
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:38,549
On account of which, I hit a car
and met Rick while buying a neck brace.

733
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:42,887
Wait a minute! You never told me you got
a divorce because of a dead tree.

734
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:45,222
The tree man.

735
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:47,350
You fell in love
with the tree man?

736
00:46:47,433 --> 00:46:50,227
I did not say "love."
Did I say love"?

737
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:52,730
This is my favorite part.

738
00:46:54,774 --> 00:46:56,692
<i>It's now or never.</i>

739
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,904
<i>"Never" is a frightening word.</i>

740
00:47:01,197 --> 00:47:03,991
<i>We'd be fools
to let happiness pass us by.</i>

741
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,790
<i>Winter must be cold
for those with no warm memories.</i>

742
00:47:13,459 --> 00:47:15,961
<i>We've already missed the spring.</i>

743
00:47:18,631 --> 00:47:20,800
Men never get this movie.

744
00:47:20,883 --> 00:47:22,468
I know.

745
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:26,931
Mommy! Mommy!

746
00:47:30,351 --> 00:47:32,395
It's okay. I'm here.

747
00:47:32,478 --> 00:47:34,855
- Dad!
- I'm comin'.

748
00:47:34,939 --> 00:47:37,024
It's all right. It's okay.

749
00:47:38,484 --> 00:47:42,405
It's all right. It's okay.
What was that about?

750
00:47:42,488 --> 00:47:44,740
- It was sinking.
- What was?

751
00:47:44,824 --> 00:47:48,119
Our house. There was water
coming in all the windows.

752
00:47:49,787 --> 00:47:52,039
Well, it's okay now.

753
00:47:53,124 --> 00:47:56,794
It's all right.
So what should we do?

754
00:47:56,877 --> 00:47:59,296
Your mother used to...

755
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,799
sing to you
when you had bad dreams.

756
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:04,635
"Bye-Bye, Blackbird."

757
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,349
I miss her.

758
00:48:10,433 --> 00:48:13,310
What do you think happens
to someone after they die?

759
00:48:14,687 --> 00:48:18,274
- I don't know.
- Like, do you believe in heaven?

760
00:48:22,028 --> 00:48:24,655
I never did.

761
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:28,159
Or the whole idea of an afterlife,
but now I don't know.

762
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:31,954
'Cause I have
these dreams about...

763
00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:35,666
about your mom.

764
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:41,088
And we have long talks...

765
00:48:41,172 --> 00:48:44,717
about you,
how you're doin'.

766
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,512
Which she sort of knows,
but I tell her anyway.

767
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:50,848
So what is that?

768
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:55,186
It's sort of an afterlife,
isn't it?

769
00:48:56,228 --> 00:48:57,980
I'm starting to forget her.

770
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:17,750
She could peel an apple...

771
00:49:19,085 --> 00:49:21,587
in one long...

772
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:23,589
curly strip.

773
00:49:25,383 --> 00:49:27,551
The whole apple.

774
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:30,429
<i> Pack up all my cares and woes </i>

775
00:49:31,681 --> 00:49:34,350
<i> Feelin' low </i>

776
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:36,227
<i> Here I go </i>

777
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:40,272
<i> I say bye - bye </i>

778
00:49:40,356 --> 00:49:41,857
I love you, Jonah.

779
00:49:42,858 --> 00:49:45,236
I love you, Dad.

780
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:53,244
See you tomorrow.

781
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:59,542
<i> Sugar's sweet,
So is she </i>

782
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,086
<i> I say bye </i>

783
00:50:02,128 --> 00:50:04,463
<i> Bye </i>

784
00:50:04,547 --> 00:50:06,465
<i> Blackbird </i>

785
00:50:12,722 --> 00:50:16,976
<i> No one seems to love </i>

786
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:21,022
<i> Or understand me now </i>

787
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:27,695
<i> Oh and hard luck stories </i>

788
00:50:29,322 --> 00:50:32,325
<i> They keep handin' me, yeah </i>

789
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:39,915
<i> Where somebody shines a light </i>

790
00:50:42,043 --> 00:50:46,088
<i> I'm comin' on home tonight now </i>

791
00:50:46,172 --> 00:50:49,759
<i> Oh, Lord
Yeah, darlin' </i>

792
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:54,263
<i> I wanna say
Bye- bye, blackbird </i>

793
00:50:54,347 --> 00:50:56,265
<i> Lord have mercy </i>

794
00:50:57,391 --> 00:50:59,393
<i> Somebody love me now </i>

795
00:51:07,193 --> 00:51:10,446
Laurie?
Hi, it's Annie.

796
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:12,573
Fine. I'm fine.

797
00:51:12,657 --> 00:51:16,327
Listen. I'm doing an article
on call-in radio shows.

798
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:20,081
Do you know anyone who works for
someone named Dr. Marcia Fieldstone?

799
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:23,334
I'm a writer for the Baltimore Sun
and a friend of Laurie Johnson's.

800
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:26,128
I'm doing a piece on how
people handle bereavement

801
00:51:26,212 --> 00:51:30,257
and I understand you had a caller
the other night, some guy from Seattle.

802
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:41,727
<i>This is Jonah Baldwin. We're not in
right now, but you can leave...</i>

803
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:47,585
Architect.

804
00:53:22,203 --> 00:53:25,456
Okay, Clarise, I'm gonna be back
either by midnight

805
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:28,084
or 8:30, if disaster strikes.

806
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:30,211
Here's one for the both of us.

807
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:32,963
- "Sleepless and Son, Baltimore."
- Now, I left the no. of the restaurant I'm gonna be at.

808
00:53:33,047 --> 00:53:35,400
If there's any problem, here's
the number the pediatrician is,

809
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:36,296
right above the phone.

810
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,950
Now, here's a bottle of Ipecac
if anybody drinks poison.

811
00:53:38,951 --> 00:53:41,138
Its right here, next to the juice glasses.

812
00:53:41,222 --> 00:53:43,265
- Fine.
- Uh.. how do I look?

813
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:44,950
- Great.
- Do I look okay?

814
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,814
Do I look all right? I look stupid.
I look like I'm tryin' too hard.

815
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:52,483
I was gonna get a haircut but then
I'd just look like I got a haircut.

816
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:53,500
This is a good letter, Dad.

817
00:53:53,501 --> 00:53:55,778
Look, the heels on
these shoes are grotesque.

818
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:57,405
I look like I'm tryin' to be tall.
Why am I...

819
00:53:57,488 --> 00:54:00,574
Her name is Annie.
Annie Reed.

820
00:54:00,658 --> 00:54:02,118
- Bye.
- Dad, read this!

821
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:03,786
Read this!

822
00:54:05,997 --> 00:54:09,667
"Dear Sleepless and Son,
I've never written..." Blah, blah.

823
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:12,336
I've been an excellent third baseman
for as long as I remember...

824
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,797
and while we're on the subject,
let's just say right now that...

825
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,341
Brooks Robinson
was the best third baseman ever.

826
00:54:17,383 --> 00:54:19,844
It's important you agree with me
on that because I'm from Baltimore.

827
00:54:19,885 --> 00:54:22,388
She thinks Brooks Robinson's
the greatest. So do you.

828
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:24,200
Everyone thinks
Brooks Robinson's the greatest.

829
00:54:24,201 --> 00:54:25,266
It's a sign.

830
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,809
Come here.

831
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:30,104
I'll show you a sign.
Here's a sign.

832
00:54:30,187 --> 00:54:32,732
All right.

833
00:54:32,815 --> 00:54:34,859
Where is Seattle?
Right.

834
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:37,194
Where is Baltimore?

835
00:54:37,278 --> 00:54:39,322
It's right there! Look!

836
00:54:39,405 --> 00:54:43,034
One, two, three, four... There's like
26 states between here and there.

837
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:44,535
Now that's a sign.

838
00:54:44,618 --> 00:54:47,246
I'm outta here.
Good-bye. Good night.

839
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:48,914
I love you.

840
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:54,962
Clarise, did you move your car?

841
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:07,391
- Thank you, Derrick.
- You're welcome.

842
00:55:07,475 --> 00:55:08,976
- I'll have...
- White wine?

843
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:12,271
- And you, sir?
- I'm fine, thank you.

844
00:55:13,439 --> 00:55:17,234
- You look good.
- You look good yourself.

845
00:55:21,781 --> 00:55:24,825
- I thought you were never gonna call me.
- You did?

846
00:55:24,909 --> 00:55:28,079
I really wanted you to and I thought
you were never going to.

847
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,081
- Excuse me, Mr. Baldwin?
- Yes?

848
00:55:30,122 --> 00:55:32,083
There's a phone call for you.

849
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,758
Thank you.
Hello?

850
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:44,095
<i>Dad, can we go to New York City
for Valentine's Day?</i>

851
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:46,430
What?

852
00:55:46,472 --> 00:55:48,641
<i>Annie Reed from Baltimore
wants to meet us....</i>

853
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:53,062
<i>at the top of the Empire State Building
on Valentine's Day.</i>

854
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:55,064
- Jonah.
- <i>What?</i>

855
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:57,733
Have you fallen down?
Are you bleeding?

856
00:55:57,817 --> 00:56:00,778
- Is Clarise there? Has she been strangled?
- <i>No.</i>

857
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,822
So this is the only reason
for this phone call?

858
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:05,658
<i>If we book now,
we can get an excursion fare.</i>

859
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:08,327
<i>Jessica's parents are travel agents,
and Jessica says...</i>

860
00:56:08,411 --> 00:56:10,413
I'm not going to have
this conversation right now.

861
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:12,748
We will talk about it
at a later time.

862
00:56:12,832 --> 00:56:16,127
I can't believe this conversation
has lasted this long. You go to bed.

863
00:56:23,676 --> 00:56:25,136
Everything all right?

864
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:27,263
Oh, yeah.
Do you have kids?

865
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:28,806
- No.
- You want mine?

866
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:34,729
I will have an Absolut
straight up, please.

867
00:56:34,812 --> 00:56:36,397
Sure.

868
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:57,001
Put that down! Stop it!

869
00:56:57,084 --> 00:56:59,795
There she is.

870
00:56:59,879 --> 00:57:01,343
Why is she bringing
those groceries?

871
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:03,674
She's gonna cook something
for us, so be prepared.

872
00:57:03,716 --> 00:57:06,635
Hi, Sam. Thanks.
Thanks.

873
00:57:06,677 --> 00:57:09,430
And let me guess.
You must be Jonah.

874
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,300
Hi

875
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:14,852
- So, this it?
- Yeah.

876
00:57:14,894 --> 00:57:17,188
- The car's down this way.
- Great.

877
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:20,600
<i>She's on her sixth painter...</i>

878
00:57:20,601 --> 00:57:22,777
and we're never
gonna finish this job.

879
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,862
Now, she wants
the fireplace re-bricked.

880
00:57:24,945 --> 00:57:27,239
Aww... I know her pretty well.
I could give her a call.

881
00:57:27,323 --> 00:57:28,500
No, no, no... I've got it solved.

882
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:31,035
I'm just gonna hit her with
one of those fireplace bricks.

883
00:57:34,372 --> 00:57:37,458
Oh, that is so funny.
You are so funny.

884
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,419
Whenever she wants anything done,
she does this whole song and dance about...

885
00:57:40,503 --> 00:57:42,755
"Oh, I don't know. I'm stupid.
You tell me.

886
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:45,841
You know better than I would,
but couldn't we flip the house around...

887
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:49,553
so everything on one side is now on the other,
and everything in the back is now in the front?

888
00:57:49,637 --> 00:57:52,250
And could the whole front of the house
open up one great big hinge?

889
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:55,226
That way I could just get in
with the garage door opener."

890
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:58,896
I just say, "Well, yeah, we can do that.
We're just gonna have to... ''

891
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,899
Move the kitchen cabinets."

892
00:58:09,073 --> 00:58:10,741
Hey Jonah, bring some of that
stuff around, alright?

893
00:58:12,785 --> 00:58:14,245
Do you like baseball?

894
00:58:15,621 --> 00:58:17,623
Yes, I do.

895
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:19,790
In fact, my firm has
box seats to the Mariners.

896
00:58:19,814 --> 00:58:21,168
Why don't we all go sometime?

897
00:58:22,878 --> 00:58:25,798
- What about camping?
- What about it?

898
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:29,301
- Do you like camping?
- I went camping once.

899
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:33,097
You know what, dad?
We oughta start camping more often.

900
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,559
You're right. Camping is good.
Time for bed.

901
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,936
- It's only 10:00.
- Yeah, 10:00.

902
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,105
Time for bed.

903
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:42,857
Good night.

904
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,150
Well, Hey,
Hey, Hey!

905
00:58:47,151 --> 00:58:50,072
Don't you wanna thank Victoria
for this delicious dinner?

906
00:58:50,156 --> 00:58:53,993
Thanks for dinner. I never saw
anybody cook potatoes that way.

907
00:58:55,453 --> 00:58:57,747
I'm glad you liked it.

908
00:58:57,788 --> 00:58:59,749
Good night, Jonah.

909
00:59:02,585 --> 00:59:05,296
Yeah, we don't see
a lot of potatoes around here.

910
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:07,298
We're rice men.

911
01:00:02,353 --> 01:00:05,022
I'm sorry, Walter.
I'm sorry.

912
01:00:09,235 --> 01:00:11,529
- Hello.
- <i>Turn on your radio.</i>

913
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:13,531
- What?
- <i>The kid is on.</i>

914
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:16,200
<i>You've got me listening to
this garbage. Go, turn it on.</i>

915
01:00:16,283 --> 01:00:18,703
Who is it?

916
01:00:18,744 --> 01:00:22,915
It's Becky. She's...
She's having trouble with Rick again.

917
01:00:22,999 --> 01:00:23,854
I'll go downstairs.

918
01:00:23,878 --> 01:00:25,918
I'll go downstairs, Becky.
I'll call you back.

919
01:00:28,713 --> 01:00:31,382
I'm sorry, Walter.
Are you bleeding?

920
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:54,300
<i>He's outside, kissing her
right this minute!</i>

921
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,548
<i>Oh, really?</i>

922
01:00:55,573 --> 01:00:59,327
<i>Jonah, tell the truth.
Are you spying on your father?</i>

923
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:02,538
- Who's he kissing right this minute?
- Shhh.. listen to this.

924
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,540
<i>- I have to make them stop.
- Do you think...</i>

925
01:01:04,582 --> 01:01:08,210
- How am I gonna explain this to Walter?
- <i>She came over and cooked dinner.</i>

926
01:01:08,294 --> 01:01:11,380
<i>She brought two bags of groceries,
like she was staying here for a year.</i>

927
01:01:11,464 --> 01:01:14,425
<i>Jonah, it's good
that your father's dating.</i>

928
01:01:14,467 --> 01:01:17,762
<i>It's just hard on you.
It's something that you think you want</i>

929
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:20,557
<i>...but then when it
actually happens, it scares you.</i>

930
01:01:20,581 --> 01:01:21,599
<i>That's not true.</i>

931
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:24,644
<i>Okay, now think. Shouldn't your
father be the judge</i>

932
01:01:24,727 --> 01:01:27,647
<i>of whether someone is right
or wrong for him?</i>

933
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,732
<i>He's not sane enough
to judge anything.</i>

934
01:01:29,774 --> 01:01:32,568
Now he's kissing her on the lips.
She's a 'ho!

935
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:35,738
My dad's been captured by a 'ho!
What am I going to do?

936
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,782
<i>Calm down, Jonah.</i>

937
01:01:37,823 --> 01:01:40,576
<i>Tomorrow morning when you're
sitting down to breakfast with your dad....</i>

938
01:01:40,618 --> 01:01:42,953
<i>tell him how you feel.</i>

939
01:01:43,037 --> 01:01:46,582
<i>It's not good to keep
your feelings inside you.</i>

940
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:54,548
Miss Scarlet. In the broom closet.
With the radio.

941
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:00,680
Walter! You scared me.
Don't ever do that again.

942
01:02:04,308 --> 01:02:07,311
- I thought I saw a black widow spider.
- You scared me to death!

943
01:02:07,395 --> 01:02:10,690
- You scared Victoria to death.
- It was right over there.

944
01:02:10,773 --> 01:02:14,485
The next time you think you see a
black widow spider, I want you to say...

945
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:18,447
"Dad, excuse me, but I believe
a poisonous insect is in the house''...

946
01:02:18,531 --> 01:02:20,700
and I will calmly come
and take care of it.

947
01:02:20,783 --> 01:02:22,326
Scream like that again, I'll kill you.

948
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,450
Becky heard this guy on the radio,
she was sure was Rick.

949
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:31,210
She was completely hysterical and then
it turned out the guy lived in Duluth.

950
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:34,213
- Where is Duluth?
- That doesn't make any sense.

951
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:37,800
I know, Walter.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

952
01:02:37,842 --> 01:02:40,469
Thank God my life is in place.

953
01:02:40,553 --> 01:02:43,472
Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

954
01:02:57,445 --> 01:03:01,449
I love this letter.
You have to write to her.

955
01:03:01,532 --> 01:03:04,660
- You think so?
- It's Y.O.H.

956
01:03:04,702 --> 01:03:06,912
Yeah. What's that?

957
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:08,622
Your Only Hope.

958
01:03:20,676 --> 01:03:23,888
I thought I would look into
doing a story on those radio shows.

959
01:03:25,348 --> 01:03:27,683
You'd probably have to go somewhere
to really look into it.

960
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:30,478
Definitely.

961
01:03:49,163 --> 01:03:51,290
Couldn't you do
a phone interview?

962
01:03:51,374 --> 01:03:55,961
Not for the kind of piece I wanna do.
I won't be in Chicago that long.

963
01:03:56,045 --> 01:03:58,130
When you get back, I'll be gone.

964
01:03:58,214 --> 01:04:00,675
And then I'll see you in New York.

965
01:04:00,758 --> 01:04:02,551
I'll get it.

966
01:04:06,514 --> 01:04:07,932
<i>This is Captain Browning.</i>

967
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:11,602
<i>We're at our cruising altitude
of approximately 35,000 feet.</i>

968
01:04:11,686 --> 01:04:16,482
<i>The weather is clear to the west, and we
expect to arrive in Seattle on schedule.</i>

969
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:20,444
- Don't you hate flying?
- Yes, I do

970
01:04:20,528 --> 01:04:25,449
and I just told the most terrible one
to the man I'm about to marry.

971
01:04:25,491 --> 01:04:28,285
Do you feel that
any lie is a betrayal?

972
01:04:29,286 --> 01:04:31,288
I said "flying."

973
01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:41,173
Thanks for bringing me out here.

974
01:04:41,257 --> 01:04:43,676
Well, he likes the planes.

975
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:46,117
Can I bring something
back for you? A souvenir?

976
01:04:46,141 --> 01:04:48,139
Does he like those
little snow globes?

977
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:50,683
You know, you shake them up
and then the snow floats down.

978
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:54,478
Sure. I'd really like that.
Thank you so much.

979
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,776
- He's eight.
- He's good at it.

980
01:05:00,818 --> 01:05:02,778
I read an article about this.

981
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,948
All children are hideous at the age of eight.
It's quite normal.

982
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:08,284
Well, maybe when I come back,

983
01:05:08,326 --> 01:05:11,704
the two of us oughta spend
some time together on our own.

984
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:13,831
What do you think?

985
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:19,003
Bye.

986
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:20,755
- Bye, Jonah.
- Bye.

987
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,766
Jonah, listen to me.
You don't know Victoria.

988
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:33,768
I hardly know her myself.

989
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:36,771
She is, in fact,
a mystery to me.

990
01:05:36,854 --> 01:05:40,191
She tosses her hair a lot.
Why does she do this?

991
01:05:40,232 --> 01:05:43,110
I have no idea. Is it a twitch?
Does she need a haircut?

992
01:05:43,194 --> 01:05:46,697
Should she use a barrette
to keep her hair out of her face?

993
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:51,369
These are things I'm willing
to get to the bottom of

994
01:05:51,452 --> 01:05:54,830
and that is why I am dating her.

995
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,167
That's all I'm doing.

996
01:05:58,209 --> 01:06:00,544
I'm not living with her.
I'm not marrying her.

997
01:06:00,586 --> 01:06:03,381
Can you appreciate
the difference?

998
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,342
This is what single people do.

999
01:06:06,384 --> 01:06:09,220
They try other people on
and see how they fit.

1000
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:12,056
But everybody's an adjustment.
Nobody's perfect.

1001
01:06:13,015 --> 01:06:15,601
There's no such thing
as a perfect...

1002
01:06:31,784 --> 01:06:33,369
Come on.

1003
01:06:35,871 --> 01:06:39,083
Dad, I was talking to Jessica
about reincarnation.

1004
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:41,210
She says you knew Annie
in another life.

1005
01:06:41,293 --> 01:06:43,879
- Who's Annie?
- The one who wrote us.

1006
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:47,466
But Jessica says you and Annie
never got together in that life.

1007
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:50,219
So your hearts are like
puzzles with missing pieces

1008
01:06:50,261 --> 01:06:52,471
and when you get together,
the puzzle's complete.

1009
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:54,056
Goddamn it.

1010
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:57,226
The reason I know this and you don't
is because I'm younger and purer.

1011
01:06:57,268 --> 01:07:00,396
So, I'm more in touch
with cosmic forces.

1012
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,316
- Who told you this stuff?
- Jessica.

1013
01:07:03,399 --> 01:07:06,277
I sincerely hope
you're not marrying Jessica.

1014
01:07:12,616 --> 01:07:17,204
<i> I remember the days 
 of just keepin' time </i>

1015
01:07:17,288 --> 01:07:21,584
<i> Of hangin' around 
 in sleepy towns </i>

1016
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:23,794
<i> Forever </i>

1017
01:07:23,878 --> 01:07:27,757
<i> Back roads empty for miles </i>

1018
01:07:29,675 --> 01:07:34,138
<i> Well, you can't have a dream 
 and cut it to fit </i>

1019
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:38,017
<i> But when I saw you 
 I knew </i>

1020
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,561
<i> We'd go together </i>

1021
01:07:40,645 --> 01:07:43,981
<i> Like a wink and a smile </i>

1022
01:07:47,652 --> 01:07:51,614
<i> Leave your old jalopy </i>

1023
01:07:51,656 --> 01:07:55,826
<i> By the railroad track </i>

1024
01:07:55,910 --> 01:08:00,122
<i> We'll get a hip 
 double-dip, tip-toppy </i>

1025
01:08:00,164 --> 01:08:03,292
<i> Two-seat Pontiac </i>

1026
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:08,798
<i> So you can rev her up </i>

1027
01:08:08,881 --> 01:08:10,841
<i> Don't go slow </i>

1028
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:14,345
<i> It's only green lights 
 and all rights </i>

1029
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:17,598
<i> Let's go together </i>

1030
01:08:17,682 --> 01:08:20,476
<i> With a wink and a smile </i>

1031
01:08:34,782 --> 01:08:37,743
<i> Give me a wink and a smile </i>

1032
01:08:49,714 --> 01:08:51,632
<i> We go together </i>

1033
01:08:51,716 --> 01:08:54,468
<i> Like a wink and a smile </i>

1034
01:08:58,389 --> 01:09:01,976
<i> Now my heart hears music </i>

1035
01:09:02,059 --> 01:09:04,812
<i> Such a simple song </i>

1036
01:09:06,397 --> 01:09:10,359
<i> Sing it again 
 The notes never end </i>

1037
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:13,863
<i> This is where I belong </i>

1038
01:09:15,156 --> 01:09:18,743
<i> Just the sound of your voice 
 The light in your eyes </i>

1039
01:09:18,826 --> 01:09:23,414
<i> We're so far away 
 from yesterday </i>

1040
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:26,042
<i> Together </i>

1041
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:29,337
<i> With a wink and a smile </i>

1042
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:35,926
<i> We go together </i>

1043
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:39,930
<i> Like a wink and a smile </i>

1044
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,322
<i>I watched him play
with his son at the beach.</i>

1045
01:09:52,346 --> 01:09:53,694
<i>Did you talk to him?</i>

1046
01:09:54,779 --> 01:09:56,697
<i>I couldn't do it.</i>

1047
01:09:58,783 --> 01:10:02,244
- How did I get here?
- <i>You told a lie and got on a plane.</i>

1048
01:10:02,286 --> 01:10:04,288
That's not what I mean.

1049
01:10:05,706 --> 01:10:09,627
I'm going back over there tomorrow
and talk to him. I am.

1050
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:12,755
<i>Okay. Good.
Good-bye.</i>

1051
01:10:12,838 --> 01:10:14,799
- Beck?
- <i>What?</i>

1052
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:19,595
- Is this crazy?
- <i>No.</i>

1053
01:10:19,637 --> 01:10:22,014
<i>That's the weirdest part about it.</i>

1054
01:10:23,099 --> 01:10:25,810
Thank you.
I love you.

1055
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:28,521
- <i>I love you too.</i>
- Good night.

1056
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:34,545
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Where's Greg?

1057
01:11:58,819 --> 01:11:59,737
Hello.

1058
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:13,250
<i>- So then what happened?
- So then I left, obviously.</i>

1059
01:12:14,085 --> 01:12:16,045
You were standing
in the middle of the street?

1060
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:19,924
You know that dream when
you're walking down the street naked
and everyone is looking at you?

1061
01:12:19,965 --> 01:12:21,676
I love that dream.

1062
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:25,388
That was nothing compared
to this humiliation. Nothing.

1063
01:12:25,429 --> 01:12:27,515
- But he saw you, right?
- He saw me.

1064
01:12:27,598 --> 01:12:31,060
- You were face-to-face?
- He said hello.

1065
01:12:31,143 --> 01:12:34,605
- He said hello, and what did you say?
- All I could say was hello.

1066
01:12:35,648 --> 01:12:37,525
Oh, my God!

1067
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:41,445
<i>And all I could say was hello.</i>

1068
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:43,572
It's a sign.

1069
01:12:43,656 --> 01:12:47,868
It's a sign that I have watched
this movie too many times.

1070
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,579
- Oh, Annie...
- So stupid!

1071
01:12:50,663 --> 01:12:53,950
The minute I listened to that
stupid program on the radio,

1072
01:12:53,951 --> 01:12:55,584
I've been a complete jerk.

1073
01:12:55,626 --> 01:12:58,337
- You are not a jerk.
- Thank you.

1074
01:12:58,421 --> 01:13:01,590
- Idiot.
- You don't know who she was, Annie.

1075
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:05,594
I saw her. I have a picture of her.
I'll show you a picture of her.

1076
01:13:05,636 --> 01:13:08,514
That detective in Seattle
sent me a picture of her.

1077
01:13:08,597 --> 01:13:10,516
Here. See?

1078
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:12,977
That's exactly
what she looks like.

1079
01:13:13,019 --> 01:13:15,229
This is a picture
of someone's back.

1080
01:13:15,313 --> 01:13:18,566
Well, it's her
and he was crazy about her.

1081
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:22,028
What's this?
This is from Seattle.

1082
01:13:33,998 --> 01:13:35,916
So I mailed your letter.

1083
01:13:38,294 --> 01:13:41,130
"Dear Annie,
thanks for your letter.

1084
01:13:41,172 --> 01:13:44,342
It was great.
You sound neat.

1085
01:13:47,678 --> 01:13:51,390
We're very excited about meeting you
in New York on Valentine's Day...

1086
01:13:51,474 --> 01:13:54,310
and seeing if we are...

1087
01:13:54,352 --> 01:13:56,937
M.F.E.O.

1088
01:13:57,021 --> 01:13:58,439
See you soon.

1089
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:02,026
Sleepless in Seattle."

1090
01:14:02,068 --> 01:14:03,361
M.F.E.O.?

1091
01:14:07,865 --> 01:14:10,534
Made For Each Other.

1092
01:14:11,494 --> 01:14:14,789
It's cute.
It's like a little clue.

1093
01:14:19,377 --> 01:14:22,672
So, he can't write. Big deal.

1094
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:25,549
Verbal ability is a highly
overrated thing in a guy

1095
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:28,552
and our pathetic need for it
is what gets us into so much trouble.

1096
01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:32,515
I will be running back to Walter's arms,
if he'll still have me.

1097
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:34,642
- What about the letter?
- It means nothing.

1098
01:14:34,725 --> 01:14:37,937
It was written before
I went out there, before the 'ho.

1099
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:44,860
The only thing is,
she didn't look like a 'ho.

1100
01:14:44,944 --> 01:14:47,822
She looked like somebody
we would've been friends with.

1101
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:55,371
- You saw her in the airport & then here?
- I tried to talk to her.

1102
01:14:55,413 --> 01:14:57,832
It was like I knew her or something...
It was weird.

1103
01:14:57,915 --> 01:14:59,333
You mean, like,
a deja vu thing?

1104
01:14:59,417 --> 01:15:03,587
It was a very French,
deja vu-ish kind of thing. Oui.

1105
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:07,174
At least you're out there
seeing people again. That's terrific.

1106
01:15:07,258 --> 01:15:09,218
<i>Well, I mean,
there's really just the one.</i>

1107
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,179
Victoria.

1108
01:15:12,263 --> 01:15:15,099
- You don't like Victoria?
- She laughs like a hyena.

1109
01:15:15,808 --> 01:15:17,768
- Is this true?
- No.

1110
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:22,106
Sort of, a little bit, but now...
Hey, tell them what you did.

1111
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:25,860
Tell 'em about the radio show.
Go ahead. They wanna hear it.

1112
01:15:25,943 --> 01:15:30,781
Tell 'em. Christmas Eve, he phones in
one of those radio call-in shows,

1113
01:15:30,823 --> 01:15:33,784
tells them I need a new wife.

1114
01:15:33,868 --> 01:15:35,619
Oh, you're kidding.

1115
01:15:35,703 --> 01:15:37,705
That's so sweet.

1116
01:15:37,788 --> 01:15:40,748
- Now, he's obsessed with
this one woman who wrote me.

1117
01:15:40,772 --> 01:15:41,751
- You serious?

1118
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:44,795
Yeah, she wants to meet me at the top
of the Empire State Building.

1119
01:15:44,879 --> 01:15:47,381
On Valentine's Day.

1120
01:15:47,465 --> 01:15:50,134
- It's like that movie.
- What movie?

1121
01:15:50,217 --> 01:15:53,137
<i>An Affair To Remember (1957)</i>
Did you ever see it?

1122
01:15:53,179 --> 01:15:55,181
Oh, God.

1123
01:15:55,264 --> 01:15:58,476
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.
Is it "car" or "cur"?

1124
01:15:58,559 --> 01:16:00,102
- Cur.
- Car.

1125
01:16:02,063 --> 01:16:04,815
She's gonna meet him at the top
of the Empire State Building...

1126
01:16:04,857 --> 01:16:07,443
only she got hit by a taxi.

1127
01:16:07,485 --> 01:16:09,445
And he waited and waited

1128
01:16:09,487 --> 01:16:12,490
and it was raining, I think.

1129
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:13,658
And then...

1130
01:16:13,741 --> 01:16:16,994
she's too proud to tell him

1131
01:16:17,078 --> 01:16:19,246
that she's, uh...

1132
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:23,668
crippled.

1133
01:16:23,751 --> 01:16:27,588
And he's too proud to find out
why she doesn't come.

1134
01:16:27,672 --> 01:16:29,632
But he comes to see her anyway.

1135
01:16:29,674 --> 01:16:32,009
I forget why, but, oh...

1136
01:16:32,051 --> 01:16:36,347
Oh, it's so amazing
when he comes to see her because

1137
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:40,518
he doesn't even notice that
she doesn't get up to say hello

1138
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:43,104
and he's very bitter.

1139
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:48,859
And you think that he's just
gonna walk out the door

1140
01:16:48,943 --> 01:16:53,656
and never know why she's just
lying there, you know, on the couch

1141
01:16:53,698 --> 01:16:58,160
with this blanket
over her shriveled little legs.

1142
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:03,374
- Are you all right?
- She's fine.

1143
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:06,919
Suddenly he goes,
"I already sold the painting."

1144
01:17:07,003 --> 01:17:10,047
And he, like,
goes to the bedroom

1145
01:17:10,131 --> 01:17:14,176
and he looks and he comes out and
he looks at her and he kind of just...

1146
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:17,847
They know and then they hug
and it's so...

1147
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:22,059
- That's a chick's movie.
- I would say so.

1148
01:17:22,143 --> 01:17:25,521
What kind of a person would write
to someone they heard on the radio?

1149
01:17:25,563 --> 01:17:28,691
I got hundreds of letters
from women all over the country.

1150
01:17:28,733 --> 01:17:30,192
Desperate women.

1151
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:33,571
Just because someone is looking for
a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.

1152
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:36,032
- How about rapacious and love-starved?
- No.

1153
01:17:36,073 --> 01:17:39,201
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist
than to find a husband after the age...

1154
01:17:39,285 --> 01:17:41,412
That is absolutely untrue.

1155
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:43,748
Right, honey. Right.

1156
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:46,208
<i>Well, I'm not lookin' for
a mail-order bride.</i>

1157
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:50,296
I just want somebody that I can have
a decent conversation with over dinner

1158
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:53,883
without it fallin' down
into weepy tears over some movie.

1159
01:17:53,966 --> 01:17:55,468
She's just so very emotional.

1160
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:57,134
Although, I cried at the end of
<i>The Dirty Dozen (1967)</i>.

1161
01:17:57,158 --> 01:17:57,678
Who didn't?

1162
01:17:57,762 --> 01:18:01,223
Jim Brown is throwin' these
hand grenades down these air shafts...

1163
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:04,477
and Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin
were sittin' on top of this...

1164
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,355
armored personnel carrier,
dressed up like Nazis.

1165
01:18:07,438 --> 01:18:10,608
They're waiting.
Trini Lopez...

1166
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:15,321
He busted his neck when they were
parachuting down behind the Nazi lines.

1167
01:18:15,404 --> 01:18:16,947
Stop it.

1168
01:18:17,031 --> 01:18:21,077
Richard Jaeckel had on this shiny helmet
'cause he was the M.P.

1169
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,119
Please, no more.

1170
01:18:23,371 --> 01:18:26,123
Oh, God, I love that movie.

1171
01:18:33,964 --> 01:18:37,218
This is the best movie
I've ever seen in my life.

1172
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:39,011
<i>What's so great about it?</i>

1173
01:18:39,095 --> 01:18:41,681
You have to find her, Johny.
You have to go to her.

1174
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:43,933
Do you know how much money it costs
to go to New York?

1175
01:18:43,975 --> 01:18:45,935
Nobody knows.

1176
01:18:45,977 --> 01:18:50,106
It changes practically every day.
How much money do you have?

1177
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:51,649
Eighty dollars.

1178
01:18:51,691 --> 01:18:55,111
I have 42. That would
probably cover taxicabs.

1179
01:18:55,152 --> 01:18:56,654
How would I get there?

1180
01:18:57,738 --> 01:19:00,241
Honey, I have to run
these tickets over to someone.

1181
01:19:00,324 --> 01:19:02,243
Can you keep an eye on things
upfront till I get back?

1182
01:19:02,326 --> 01:19:04,412
Sure, Mom.

1183
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:17,925
- Do you want a window seat or an aisle?
- Window.

1184
01:19:18,009 --> 01:19:20,303
- Do you want a fruit plate?
- I don't know. Do I?

1185
01:19:20,344 --> 01:19:23,097
I'd rather die
than eat airplane food.

1186
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:25,391
I'm telling them you're 12
so you can fly unaccompanied...

1187
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:27,476
and the stewardess won't carry
you around and stuff like that.

1188
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,187
Are you crazy?
Who'd believe I'm 12?

1189
01:19:30,271 --> 01:19:33,190
If it's in the computer,
they believe anything.

1190
01:19:33,274 --> 01:19:35,192
Are you sure?

1191
01:19:35,276 --> 01:19:37,695
Do you want me to say that
you're really short for your age...

1192
01:19:37,778 --> 01:19:39,947
and that they shouldn't say anything
'cause it would hurt your feelings?

1193
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:42,366
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1194
01:19:42,408 --> 01:19:47,288
<i> Sometimes it's hard to be </i>

1195
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:49,332
<i> A woman </i>

1196
01:19:52,209 --> 01:19:55,296
<i> Givin' all your love </i>

1197
01:19:55,379 --> 01:19:59,842
<i> To just one man </i>

1198
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:01,218
Walter.

1199
01:20:02,553 --> 01:20:06,307
- You're gonna miss the train.
- No, I'm not.

1200
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:10,019
I'm so happy, Becky.
Finally,  I feel happy.

1201
01:20:10,102 --> 01:20:12,063
This is right. This is real.

1202
01:20:12,104 --> 01:20:14,857
Everything else is what happens
when you watch too many movies...

1203
01:20:14,899 --> 01:20:17,401
and you completely
lose sight of what counts.

1204
01:20:17,485 --> 01:20:19,737
Please, don't tell anybody
what happened

1205
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:22,406
because I would be so absolutely
mortified if anyone knew...

1206
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:25,785
I did anything even
remotely close to what I've done.

1207
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:28,871
- Thank you. Do you promise?
- I promise.

1208
01:20:28,913 --> 01:20:31,374
'Sleepless in Seattle'
is history.

1209
01:20:31,415 --> 01:20:35,544
<i> He's hard to understand </i>

1210
01:20:37,755 --> 01:20:42,218
<i> And if you love him </i>

1211
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:46,847
<i> Oh, be proud of him </i>

1212
01:20:46,931 --> 01:20:50,267
<i> 'Cause after all </i>

1213
01:20:50,309 --> 01:20:53,104
<i> He's just a man </i>

1214
01:20:56,315 --> 01:20:59,276
<i> Stand by your man </i>

1215
01:21:02,196 --> 01:21:03,781
I was...

1216
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:07,159
- Go ahead.
- You go.

1217
01:21:07,243 --> 01:21:09,662
Okay. Well,
I was just gonna say...

1218
01:21:09,745 --> 01:21:13,332
that ever since Christmas,
you've been different...

1219
01:21:13,416 --> 01:21:15,960
kind of distracted, distant.

1220
01:21:16,043 --> 01:21:18,504
But now...

1221
01:21:18,587 --> 01:21:23,259
it feels as if you're coming back
from wherever you were.

1222
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,927
I am.

1223
01:21:26,804 --> 01:21:29,390
I was just, uh...

1224
01:21:29,473 --> 01:21:33,602
I just got...
I think I got nervous.

1225
01:21:33,686 --> 01:21:35,896
But that's normal, right?

1226
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:39,692
I mean, don't you ever
feel nervous about...

1227
01:21:39,775 --> 01:21:41,736
You know?

1228
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:43,821
What?

1229
01:21:43,904 --> 01:21:45,156
Forever.

1230
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:58,210
I did and you know what I think?

1231
01:21:58,294 --> 01:22:02,506
I think I thought
it was too perfect, you know?

1232
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:06,093
I started to wonder
if we were the human equivalent...

1233
01:22:06,177 --> 01:22:08,304
of two rights making a wrong.

1234
01:22:08,346 --> 01:22:10,306
You know what it was?

1235
01:22:10,348 --> 01:22:13,976
It was like <i>kismet</i>, but not,
if you see what I mean.

1236
01:22:15,519 --> 01:22:16,979
You have to grow up.

1237
01:22:17,021 --> 01:22:19,857
You just can't keep having
all these adolescent fantasies

1238
01:22:19,899 --> 01:22:22,360
about how exciting
your life is gonna be.

1239
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:25,071
Don't hate me,
but I love this pattern.

1240
01:22:25,154 --> 01:22:27,156
- You couldn't.
- I do.

1241
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:30,076
This is just like
my grandmother's china.

1242
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:32,620
How many place settings
should I put down?

1243
01:22:32,703 --> 01:22:34,288
Ten.

1244
01:22:36,957 --> 01:22:39,835
Exactly. Eight is too few.

1245
01:22:39,877 --> 01:22:42,546
Twelve is too many.

1246
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:10,032
-Walter!
- <i>It was my mother's.</i>

1247
01:23:11,993 --> 01:23:14,245
I had them size it down.

1248
01:23:15,663 --> 01:23:17,748
She had really fat fingers.

1249
01:23:20,251 --> 01:23:21,961
It's so beautiful.

1250
01:23:22,044 --> 01:23:25,256
It's exactly what I would
pick out if I had...

1251
01:23:25,297 --> 01:23:28,134
every ring in the whole world
to choose from.

1252
01:23:30,761 --> 01:23:32,263
You see what I mean?

1253
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:35,891
There are people who would like
a relationship to be full of surprises.

1254
01:23:35,933 --> 01:23:38,311
But I am not one of those people.

1255
01:23:38,394 --> 01:23:40,604
No, sirree.

1256
01:23:40,688 --> 01:23:43,399
Surprises are highly overrated.

1257
01:23:46,277 --> 01:23:49,405
I'm leavin' first thing in the morning
but I'm only gonna be gone one night.

1258
01:23:49,447 --> 01:23:51,574
Clarise is gonna be here.
So, you'll be able to see...

1259
01:23:51,657 --> 01:23:53,993
plenty of Geraldo
and Nightmare On Elm Street 12.

1260
01:23:54,076 --> 01:23:56,370
- I will never know.
- Are you going with her?

1261
01:23:58,289 --> 01:24:00,416
I'm going with Victoria, yes.

1262
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:05,463
And don't try anything tricky.
Understand?

1263
01:24:08,507 --> 01:24:11,594
Don't go rollin' in poison ivy
as soon as I leave the house

1264
01:24:11,636 --> 01:24:15,097
or lock yourself in a closet or do
anything that makes you need stitches.

1265
01:24:15,139 --> 01:24:17,266
If your finger falls off,
it's stayin' off.

1266
01:24:17,308 --> 01:24:19,769
No one's gonna pack it on ice
and take you to the hospital

1267
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:22,980
so you can be
a breakthrough in laser surgery.

1268
01:24:23,064 --> 01:24:26,108
- Is this about that woman in Baltimore?
- Annie.

1269
01:24:30,655 --> 01:24:33,074
- I don't care what you do!
- Good! Fine!

1270
01:24:33,157 --> 01:24:36,452
I'll tell you what I'm doin'
this weekend. I'm getting laid.

1271
01:24:36,494 --> 01:24:38,496
1990s and nobody is getting laid.

1272
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:41,248
I'm the only man in America
who is getting laid this weekend.

1273
01:24:41,332 --> 01:24:45,670
and I haven't been laid that much.
Six girls in college, maybe seven.

1274
01:24:46,921 --> 01:24:49,882
- How long you been standin' there?
- Forever.

1275
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:53,803
- What did you hear me just say?
- "Six girls in college, maybe seven."

1276
01:24:53,844 --> 01:24:56,597
Seven.
Eight! Mary Kelly.

1277
01:24:56,681 --> 01:24:58,140
This is the one I like.

1278
01:25:01,018 --> 01:25:03,187
Jonah, the fact is...

1279
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:06,315
you're not gonna like any woman
because it isn't your mother.

1280
01:25:06,357 --> 01:25:07,984
How do you know?

1281
01:25:08,025 --> 01:25:11,487
- What's wrong with Annie?
- Oh, Jonah, shut up!

1282
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:14,156
Shut up?

1283
01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:17,660
<i>Mom never said "shut up'' to me.</i>
Mom never yelled at me.

1284
01:25:17,702 --> 01:25:20,871
- The conversation is finished.
- Why can't we go to New York?

1285
01:25:20,955 --> 01:25:23,708
There is no way
that we are going on a plane...

1286
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:26,293
to meet some woman
who could be a crazy, sick lunatic.

1287
01:25:26,377 --> 01:25:28,879
<i>- Didn't you see <i>Fatal Attraction (1987)</i>?
- You wouldn't let me.</i>

1288
01:25:28,963 --> 01:25:31,507
Well, I saw it!
And it scared the shit outta me.

1289
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:34,677
It scared the shit
outta every man in America!

1290
01:25:35,594 --> 01:25:38,055
I'm not leaving till you say yes.

1291
01:25:43,811 --> 01:25:46,731
- <i>I hate you!</i>
- That's good!

1292
01:25:46,814 --> 01:25:48,357
You'll have a lot to tell Oprah

1293
01:25:48,441 --> 01:25:50,735
how your dad destroyed your life
'cause he had to go off...

1294
01:25:50,818 --> 01:25:54,363
for a weekend special
at the Holiday Inn!

1295
01:26:08,836 --> 01:26:12,256
Jonah, Clarise is here
and I gotta go.

1296
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:15,968
Hey, Jonah.

1297
01:26:22,933 --> 01:26:25,269
All right.
Jonah, listen.

1298
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:27,688
I gotta go, and I'm...

1299
01:26:56,133 --> 01:26:58,594
Jessica, honey,
you have to tell us where he is.

1300
01:26:58,678 --> 01:27:02,139
Jonah's daddy is very upset.

1301
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:05,726
Jessica, this is your father.
Tell us where he is, right this minute.

1302
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:10,731
N.Y.

1303
01:27:10,815 --> 01:27:12,817
- What is that?
- No way.

1304
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,486
That's N.W.

1305
01:27:15,569 --> 01:27:17,738
New York.

1306
01:27:17,822 --> 01:27:19,740
He's on his way to New York.

1307
01:27:19,824 --> 01:27:21,283
- What?
- How?

1308
01:27:21,325 --> 01:27:24,578
- United 597.
- Jessica.

1309
01:27:24,662 --> 01:27:27,289
- When does it leave?
- 7:30.

1310
01:27:34,213 --> 01:27:37,258
Here you go. Here's a nice pen
for you for flying with us.

1311
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:38,759
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1312
01:27:38,843 --> 01:27:41,095
- Can I take this for you?
- No.

1313
01:27:56,944 --> 01:27:59,280
- Where to, kid?
- Empire State Building.

1314
01:27:59,363 --> 01:28:02,199
Hold on.
Empire State Building.

1315
01:28:02,241 --> 01:28:05,619
Get a little further away
from the curb next time, Mac.

1316
01:28:07,455 --> 01:28:08,706
There it is.

1317
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:11,459
What you gonna do
when you get up there?

1318
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:13,669
- Spit off the top?
- No.

1319
01:28:13,753 --> 01:28:16,380
I'm going to meet my new mother.

1320
01:28:36,317 --> 01:28:39,236
Excuse me. I'm Jonah.
Are you Annie?

1321
01:28:39,278 --> 01:28:41,572
No. I'm Cynthia.

1322
01:28:48,663 --> 01:28:51,248
Excuse me.
Are you Annie?

1323
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:31,539
Great table. Thanks.

1324
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:35,710
Something wrong?

1325
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:39,547
- Can I get you a drink?
- Some champagne?

1326
01:29:41,132 --> 01:29:43,634
Fine.

1327
01:29:43,676 --> 01:29:45,136
Can we have a bottle...

1328
01:29:45,177 --> 01:29:48,097
of Dom DeLuise?

1329
01:29:50,433 --> 01:29:52,351
- Just kidding.
- It was a joke.

1330
01:29:52,435 --> 01:29:55,062
- He meant Dom Perignon.
- I got it.

1331
01:29:58,649 --> 01:30:00,860
Beautiful view, isn't it?

1332
01:30:00,943 --> 01:30:05,781
Walter, there's something
I have to tell you.

1333
01:30:20,296 --> 01:30:22,715
Hey, I'm sorry.
I have an emergency.

1334
01:30:22,798 --> 01:30:25,468
Look! Money!
All right?

1335
01:30:25,551 --> 01:30:27,845
- Get right in.
- Wait a minute.

1336
01:30:27,887 --> 01:30:29,472
Taxi!

1337
01:31:43,295 --> 01:31:47,550
So, he could be on top
of the Empire State Building now.

1338
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:52,600
No. I guess
he could be. No

1339
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:57,310
It's not him, Walter.
It's me.

1340
01:31:58,936 --> 01:32:00,855
I can't do this.

1341
01:32:02,565 --> 01:32:05,192
Look, Annie...

1342
01:32:05,276 --> 01:32:08,946
I love you,
but let's leave that outta this.

1343
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:13,117
I don't wanna be someone
that you're settling for.

1344
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:17,079
I don't wanna be someone
that anyone settles for.

1345
01:32:18,706 --> 01:32:20,624
Marriage is hard enough...

1346
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:24,462
without bringing such
low expectations into it.

1347
01:32:24,503 --> 01:32:25,963
Isn't it?

1348
01:32:26,839 --> 01:32:29,300
Walter, I don't deserve you.

1349
01:32:30,176 --> 01:32:32,637
Nah, I wouldn't put it that way.

1350
01:32:34,138 --> 01:32:36,474
But, okay.

1351
01:32:52,657 --> 01:32:53,949
You okay?

1352
01:32:54,867 --> 01:32:56,661
Yeah.

1353
01:33:01,957 --> 01:33:03,959
- What?
- Look.

1354
01:33:12,677 --> 01:33:15,763
- It's a sign.
- Who needed a sign?

1355
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:20,810
Walter, I have to go.

1356
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,910
Jonah... Jonah...

1357
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:41,300
Dad! Dad!

1358
01:33:55,803 --> 01:34:00,141
What if something had happened to you?
What if I couldn't get to you?

1359
01:34:00,224 --> 01:34:03,019
I'm sorry.

1360
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:07,315
What would I have done?

1361
01:34:07,398 --> 01:34:10,693
You are my family.
You're all I've got.

1362
01:34:10,735 --> 01:34:13,321
I thought she'd be here.
I thought she'd come.

1363
01:34:13,404 --> 01:34:15,990
We're doin' okay, aren't we now?
Aren't we OK? Aren't we all right?

1364
01:34:16,073 --> 01:34:18,188
I mean, so far, have I done
anything really stupid?

1365
01:34:18,212 --> 01:34:18,909
No.

1366
01:34:18,993 --> 01:34:21,495
- Have I screwed it up for the both of us?
- No.

1367
01:35:15,174 --> 01:35:18,594
- Observation deck?
- Sorry, ma'am, but it's too late.

1368
01:35:19,804 --> 01:35:22,014
No, please, I really
need to get up there.

1369
01:35:22,098 --> 01:35:24,517
We're closing up.
No more runs tonight.

1370
01:35:30,231 --> 01:35:32,483
Listen.

1371
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:36,112
Can I just take a look? There's someone
I was supposed to meet.

1372
01:35:36,195 --> 01:35:38,823
He's probably not there,
but if I don't at least look...

1373
01:35:38,906 --> 01:35:41,325
I'll always wonder about it.

1374
01:35:41,409 --> 01:35:43,327
Cary Grant, right?

1375
01:35:43,411 --> 01:35:45,705
You know that movie?

1376
01:35:45,788 --> 01:35:48,040
One of my wife's favorites.

1377
01:35:56,799 --> 01:35:59,969
Maybe when we get home,
we'll get a dog.

1378
01:36:00,011 --> 01:36:03,347
- Okay.
- What do you mean "okay"?

1379
01:36:03,389 --> 01:36:06,559
- Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
- Sure.

1380
01:36:19,363 --> 01:36:21,991
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

1381
01:36:24,493 --> 01:36:27,371
Can I take a minute?

1382
01:36:27,413 --> 01:36:28,998
Go ahead.

1383
01:37:42,863 --> 01:37:45,032
I left it by the telescopes.

1384
01:38:11,892 --> 01:38:14,228
- It's you.
- It's me.

1385
01:38:14,312 --> 01:38:18,149
- I saw you in the street.
- Are you Annie?

1386
01:38:20,109 --> 01:38:21,986
Yes.

1387
01:38:24,822 --> 01:38:26,657
You're Annie?

1388
01:38:29,327 --> 01:38:31,370
This must be yours.

1389
01:38:31,454 --> 01:38:34,665
I'm Jonah.
This is my dad.

1390
01:38:34,749 --> 01:38:36,667
- His name's Sam.
- Hi, Jonah.

1391
01:38:45,676 --> 01:38:47,762
- And who's this?
- Howard.

1392
01:38:47,845 --> 01:38:50,598
Oh, Howard.
Hello, Howard.

1393
01:39:06,030 --> 01:39:07,281
We better go.

1394
01:39:15,081 --> 01:39:17,041
Shall we?

1395

01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:08,050
