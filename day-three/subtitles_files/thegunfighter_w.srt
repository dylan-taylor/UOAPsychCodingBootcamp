1
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,410
- Hiya, Jimmie.
- Hi, old-timer.

2
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,173
- Give me a drink.
- Say!

3
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,257
- Just give me the drink, will you?
- You bet your life, Jimmie.

4
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,022
Do you know who that is? Jimmie Ringo.

5
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,523
Well, what do you know?

6
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,774
- Nice to see you again, Jimmie.
- Thanks.

7
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,864
Do you remember the old Buckhorn in Paso?

8
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,280
- You worked there?
- Five years ago, when Tim O'Leary had it.

9
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,995
He don't look so tough to me.

10
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:34,708
If he ain't so tough, there's been an awful lot
of sudden natural deaths in his vicinity.

11
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:39,376
- How many do you figure?
- 10, 12, 15. Depends upon who's telling it.

12
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:44,343
- I bet he ain't as fast as Wyatt Earp.
- In Dodge City they say he is.

13
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,132
Just two hands.

14
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,348
Yeah, the same number, it looks like, but...

15
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,060
Wait a minute, Eddie.
You ain't thinking of doing nothing foolish?

16
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:58,604
- You mean he's so tough I can't talk to him?
- I mean this ain't no joke. That's a mean man.

17
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:03,866
I just want to see how an important fella like
that handles himself. What's wrong with that?

18
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:08,405
I'm telling you, Eddie,
I wouldn't do it if I was you.

19
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:15,458
Chuck, how about a little service down here?
That's if Mr Frazzlebottom don't object.

20
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,716
- Eddie, don't you know who this is?
- You mean it ain't Mr Frazzlebottom?

21
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,130
- He's Jimmie Ringo, Eddie.
- It looks like Mr Frazzlebottom to me.

22
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,674
You ever heard anybody kid like him?

23
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,014
How about a drink, Mr Frazzlebottom?

24
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,556
- No, thanks.
- How's that, Mr Frazzlebottom?

25
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,895
- Eddie, please...
- Please what?

26
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,028
I asked the man to have a drink.
What's wrong with that?

27
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,281
How about it, Mr Frazzlebottom?

28
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,484
OK, partner.

29
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,655
I knew Mr Frazzlebottom
wasn't gonna pass up a free one.

30
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,290
Don't you understand, Eddie?
This is Jimmie Ringo.

31
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:57,204
So it's Jimmie Ringo.
Is everybody supposed to fall on their knees?

32
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,793
Well, you can be a little polite at least.

33
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:05,507
Mr Ringo, Chuck figures you've got extra
consideration coming to you. Is that right?

34
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,342
Nope.

35
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:13,012
How's that, Mr Ringo? You'll have
to speak up if you want me to hear you.

36
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,982
Why don't you button up
your britches and go home?

37
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:22,020
How'd you like to try to make me, Mr Ringo?

38
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,188
Now listen, partner.

39
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:29,737
I come in here minding my own business.
How about letting me go out the same way?

40
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,998
I want to know first what you meant
by that remark you just passed.

41
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,660
I tell you what, you just bought me a drink.

42
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:41,456
Now I'll buy you one and then we'll drop it.
Give him a drink from me.

43
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,001
Never mind a drink. I want to know
what you meant by that remark.

44
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,967
- Listen, Eddie.
- I ain't talking to you! I'm talking to Mr Ringo.

45
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,259
I want to know what he meant
by that remark he passed.

46
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:57,977
How come I gotta run into a squirt like
you nearly every place I go these days?

47
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,767
What are you trying to do?
Show off for your friends?

48
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:06,235
- Are you ready to back up that remark?
- Ain't some of you in charge of this donkey?

49
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,742
- I'm telling you, Mr Ringo!
- Eddie don't mean no real harm.

50
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,746
Then let Eddie keep his big, ugly nose
out of my business.

51
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,756
- Did you see that?
- Yes, sir. He drew first.

52
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,337
- Did you see it?
- Yeah. I saw it.

53
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:31,222
Yes, sir, I saw it. Except I'd get on
out of town anyway if I was you.

54
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,677
Why?

55
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:38,938
Because he's got three brothers
that ain't gonna care who drew first.

56
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,522
All right.

57
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,567
Everybody stay where you are.

58
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,240
- He's an hour ahead.
- Must be killing his horse.

59
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,656
Ain't doing our ones any good, either.

60
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:44,120
He can't keep it up at this rate.
That horse won't last half a day.

61
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,256
All right, put up your hands.

62
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:55,674
Now drop your guns,
right out there where I can see them.

63
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:03,432
Now get off your horses
and stay away from them guns.

64
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,691
Back up. Right back there.

65
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,502
Go on, boy, get out.
Get out, get out, get out.

66
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,962
Come on, get out.
Go on, boy, get out. Get out.

67
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,127
Get out, get out, get out.

68
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,308
- Can you walk?
- Never mind about me, bud.

69
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,351
You worry about yourself.

70
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,442
You've got three hours' walk
to Santa Fe. Get going.

71
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,279
I'm warning you, Ringo.
We're gonna get you yet.

72
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,571
- I know, I heard that before too.
- You had no right to throw down on a boy.

73
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:05,915
What was I supposed to do? Let that little boy
shoot me full of holes? Get out of here.

74
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,250
He was no more than a kid.

75
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,002
He's heading straight for Cayenne.

76
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,589
Well, you think you can make it?

77
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,676
Cayenne ain't no further than Santa Fe.

78
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,886
Come on.

79
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,498
- Give me a drink.
- Are you up early or out late?

80
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:18,509
Either way you want it, partner,
just so I get a drink.

81
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,046
Jimmie Ringo.

82
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,139
Where was it with you?

83
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:33,650
The Mint Saloon in Dodge City. You and
Bucky Harris came in nearly every night.

84
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,902
- Did we ever get a drink?
- Sure.

85
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,197
Oh.

86
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,151
Sure. Sorry, Jimmie.

87
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,157
Here. Remember now?

88
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,366
Yeah. I remember now. What about
something to eat? You got a cook here?

89
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,951
- My old woman is back there.
- You got a steak?

90
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,164
- I got a steak.
- A steak, eggs and a pot of black coffee.

91
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,420
What about a place to wash up first?

92
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,378
Right out on the back porch here.
I'll show you.

93
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,840
Never mind, I can find it.

94
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,427
You got a livery stable here, boy?

95
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,717
He's a little astonished, Jimmie.

96
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,262
When you get him unastonished,
tell him to take care of my horse.

97
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,103
Don't ride him, lead him. He's all wore out.

98
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,815
Archie, you heard what Mr Ringo said.

99
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,982
- You gonna be around?
- Hurry up, Archie. Sure, I'm here all day.

100
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:27,278
- I want to have a little talk with you.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,891
Never mind the horse. Run over yonder and
tell the marshal that Jimmie Ringo is here.

102
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,644
- Was it really him?
- Go on, I tell you. Run.

103
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,901
Will you please leave that blamed mop here?

104
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,787
Marshal! Jimmie Ringo is here, Marshal.

105
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,619
- Where?
- In the Palace Bar. You gonna shoot him?

106
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,163
- Who told you it was Jimmie Ringo?
- Mac. Mac knows him.

107
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,800
Mac called him Jimmie.
He's on the back porch, washing himself.

108
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,633
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

109
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,264
Get hold of Bud and Skeeter.

110
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,793
- Where is he?
- On the back porch, getting cleaned up.

111
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:11,011
I ain't after any trouble, Mark. I just thought
you'd want to know he was here.

112
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,178
Sit over there, Charlie. Stand down there,
Skeeter. Take the door, Bud.

113
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,982
Just take it easy and don't try to jump him.

114
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,260
Hiya, Jimmie.

115
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,967
Mark.

116
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,884
I'll be a son of a gun. How are you, partner?

117
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,098
I'm fine, Jimmie.

118
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,982
- Are you joking?
- Nope. I'm the marshal here now.

119
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,942
Well, I'll be darned.

120
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,863
- These barroom loafers, your deputies?
- Mm-hm.

121
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,652
- For me?
- Mm-hm.

122
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,039
You won't be needing them.
I ain't starting anything.

123
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,869
Are you sure?

124
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:23,162
Mark, that's the last thing I want, trouble.

125
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,376
All right, boys.

126
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:32,631
- What are you doing here, Jimmie?
- Just about to have a drink. How about it?

127
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,300
- No, thanks.
- Marshal Mark Strett.

128
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:42,439
Well, if that ain't a good one.
But I'm glad for you, Mark. Mighty glad.

129
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,852
Thanks. But I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to ask you to move on.

130
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,364
Why? I ain't wanted for anything
around here, am I?

131
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,026
No. I just want you out of town anyway.
And pronto.

132
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,536
- Coffee's ready.
- Thank you, lady.

133
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,745
You don't mind my having something to eat
while we discuss this, do you?

134
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,832
Matter of fact, I don't know anybody
I'd rather talk to than you.

135
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:09,296
- Lady, bring another cup for the marshal.
- Yes, sir.

136
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,506
How about it, Mark?

137
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,306
I've something I want to talk to you about.

138
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,352
It looks to me like you've
got a gossip on your staff.

139
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,642
That's your public, Jimmie.

140
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,606
Yeah, I'm a big man now.

141
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:33,491
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
Top gun of the West.

142
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,366
Yep.

143
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:40,031
I got more people wondering when I'm gonna
get killed than any man in the country.

144
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,293
You don't sound as happy about it
as you did the last time I saw you.

145
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,374
How many is it now? 11?

146
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,961
12. There's one you ain't heard about yet.

147
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,467
You really keep count?

148
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,175
Don't ask dumb questions, Mark.

149
00:16:55,473 --> 00:17:00,343
What's the trouble now, Jimmie?
Somebody after you?

150
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,932
- Three somebodies.
- The law?

151
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,018
No. This is personal.

152
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,184
I don't want them to catch up with you here.

153
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,478
I don't want them to do that anywhere.

154
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,319
That's why you gotta move on right away.

155
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,909
You know why I come here, don't you?

156
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,949
I guess I do.

157
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,082
- How is she?
- Fine.

158
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,958
- And the boy?
- Getting on fine.

159
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:37,923
- I want to see her, Mark.
- Do you think she wants to see you?

160
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:45,224
I got something important to see her about,
and then I'll clear out. Where can I find her?

161
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,015
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

162
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:54,234
- What do you mean, you can't tell me?
- All right, then. Won't tell you.

163
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,866
- You want a steak, Marshal?
- No, thanks.

164
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:03,747
- Why won't you?
- Because nobody here knows who she is.

165
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:09,002
She never even told the boy about you.
They've got another name and another life.

166
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,881
It looks to me like
that's the way she wants it to stay.

167
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:18,554
Will you tell me what name
she's going under? So as I can write to her.

168
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,181
Nope. I won't tell you that either.

169
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:32,735
Looks to me like you're taking quite a lot
on your own responsibility, ain't you, Mark?

170
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:39,367
I'm doing what I think is right, Jimmie. And
I'm hoping I can make you see it that way too.

171
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,930
How'd you like to see that street
out there full of gunplay?

172
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,140
I'd rather not.

173
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,559
That's probably what you're gonna have
in a couple of hours.

174
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:18,652
Cos I ain't leaving here
till you get ahold of Peggy for me.

175
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:23,444
- What if she don't want to talk to you?
- Let her do the deciding about that.

176
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:27,831
- Will you go then, if I tell her?
- I told you I would.

177
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:34,213
- Just tell her, not make her do anything.
- Just leave it to her. That's all I ask.

178
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,798
You'd better wait in here, not move around
much. I'll see what I can do about it.

179
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:45,137
If you got any squirts around here that
want to make a big name for themselves,

180
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,801
cool them off before we run into any trouble.

181
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,016
I will.

182
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,773
Boys, get on away.

183
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:01,486
Go about your business and leave Ringo
alone. He ain't bothering anybody, is he?

184
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,492
- Faster than Wyatt Earp?
- Pa says he's the fastest.

185
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,280
Jimmie Ringo could kill Wyatt Earp.
I bet you a million dollars.

186
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,871
- You seen Hunt Bromley around?
- No. What's he done now?

187
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,662
Nothing. I just want to see him.
Pass the word around, will you?

188
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,299
- Morning, Marshal.
- Morning, Miss Helen.

189
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,890
- He don't look so tough to me.
- Yeah, yeah.

190
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:31,394
That's the way it always starts -
he don't look so tough to somebody.

191
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,557
Except with this somebody,
it's gonna stop there.

192
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,899
It better. With a man like that,
you can't come off much better than second.

193
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,438
If he don't bother me, I don't bother him.

194
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,280
The only somebody that's bothering me
right now is Mr Hunt Bromley.

195
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:49,071
Yeah. I forgot about that squirt.
Have you seen him already?

196
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,116
No. Maybe you'd better take
a look around for him.

197
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:56,537
- Want me to bring him in?
- Just tell him I want to see him.

198
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,003
- But make sure he comes.
- I'll get him.

199
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,005
- And Charlie.
- Yeah?

200
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,263
Watch yourself.
Don't take any chances with that boy.

201
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,970
I don't aim to, Marshal.

202
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,976
- Morning, Charlie.
- Have you seen Hunt Bromley this morning?

203
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,272
- No. Not this morning.
- Tell him I'm looking for him if you see him.

204
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,315
Sure will, if we see him.

205
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,705
Huh.

206
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,704
Looks like it might be
a right interesting day.

207
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,955
- Carrie Lou.
- Hello, Mr Mark.

208
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,376
- Where are all you giris going?
- We got a holiday.

209
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:48,797
None of the boys came to school this
morning, so Miss Walsh said we could go.

210
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,432
- All the boys played hooky?
- Yes, sir.

211
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,471
Went downtown to see that bad man,
that Jimmie Ringo, that's down there.

212
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,514
Come on, Carrie Lou!

213
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,926
Mark.

214
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,684
- You already heard, huh?
- Yes. The children told me.

215
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,347
The giris, that is.
None of the boys came this morning.

216
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,982
I guess they're all around the Palace Bar.

217
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,236
- Little Jimmie too?
- I suppose so.

218
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,523
He's about as wild as the rest of them.

219
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,693
What's Jim doing here, Mark? Do you know?

220
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,033
- He says he wants to see you.
- What about?

221
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:58,701
- He didn't say. I thought you might know.
- No.

222
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,711
I didn't tell him anything,
your name or anything.

223
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:07,547
I just said I'd tell you he wants to see you
and leave the rest to you.

224
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,724
What do you think?

225
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,931
I ain't thinking.

226
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,978
I got nothing to say either way.

227
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,102
Well...

228
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,402
I won't do it.

229
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:34,069
I can fix it for you on the quiet
if you want to see him.

230
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:39,457
No. I think it's better the way it is.
Tell him I'm sorry.

231
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,664
Whatever you say, Peg.

232
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,589
Mark.

233
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,592
How does he look?

234
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:54,973
Just about the same, I guess.
A little older, a little tireder.

235
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:59,303
Not as cocky as he used to be.

236
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,892
Tell him I'm very sorry.

237
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,350
I'll tell him.

238
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:30,676
- Want some more coffee, Mr Ringo?
- No, thank you, lady.

239
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:37,053
- Tell him to bring that bottle over here.
- Coming right up, Jimmie.

240
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:44,352
Best stuff in the West, Old Puma Rye. Lot of
fellas around here won't drink anything else.

241
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:51,022
Why don't somebody chase them kids
out of there? Ain't you got a school here?

242
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,565
Sure, Jimmie, we got a school.

243
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,160
I'll get them away from there.

244
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:08,463
Get away from here and stay away.
Come on, now, get off there.

245
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,171
...broke his back,
jumping over a railroad track.

246
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:16,179
Stay away, please. Don't come back.

247
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:26,349
Jimmie Walsh! Now, just you wait
till your mother hears about this.

248
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:32,988
- But we're not hurting anybody, Mrs Devlin.
- You wait till I tell her you're at the saloon.

249
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:38,535
- Morning, Mrs Devlin.
- Morning. It's simply an outrage.

250
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,413
That murderer is sitting over in that saloon
like an honoured guest,

251
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,745
and the children are running wild.

252
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,832
I completely agree with you.
And five pounds of sugar.

253
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,292
And did you see all those loafers?

254
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:54,460
- You'd think it was Deadwood.
- Mark Strett'll get him out soon.

255
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:59,302
Soon? How long is a murderer supposed to
be entertained? How much are the potatoes?

256
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,262
Eight cents a peck. Two for 15.

257
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,973
- Half a peck.
- You know who'll do something?

258
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,890
- Mrs Pennyfeather.
- Exactly. Will you go with me to talk to her?

259
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,935
I will. Soon as I get
some of these lovely onions.

260
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,195
- What about you, Mrs Cooper?
- I'd like to meet her.

261
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,404
- Morning, ladies.
- Good morning, Mr Marlowe.

262
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,490
Twist of tobacco, George.
What's all the excitement?

263
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,452
- It's that murderer, of course.
- What murderer?

264
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:30,041
- That Jimmie Ringo. Haven't you heard?
- Where's Jimmie Ringo?

265
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:34,333
Sitting right over there in the Palace Bar,
just as big as you please.

266
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,174
We're going straight
to Mrs Pennyfeather right now.

267
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,887
Hiya, Jerry.

268
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,232
What'd you forget?

269
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,409
What are you going to do?

270
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,586
Jerry!

271
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:15,336
Jimmie Ringo's in the Palace Bar. When he
comes out, he's going to get this in the face.

272
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,126
- Have you gone crazy?
- Get your hand off that door.

273
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,545
- That's murder.
- And when he killed Roy?

274
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:24,091
- You're not even sure that was Ringo.
- He was in the bunch.

275
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,352
But you don't know that.
That's just what people said.

276
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,856
Please don't get us in any more trouble.
We've got all straightened out now.

277
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:37,271
You're wasting your breath, Alice. All I know
is, Ringo killed my boy and I will kill Ringo.

278
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,737
Just as soon as he walks out that door.

279
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:54,000
- Did that boy take care of my horse?
- Getting cleaned up right now, Jimmie.

280
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,919
Here he comes!

281
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,316
Never do that again, Alice. Never!

282
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,024
I know what I'm doing
and I'm gonna do it.

283
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,899
Confound that boy.

284
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,070
Archie? Say, any of you fellas seen Archie?

285
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,954
Yeah, Mac. He just went
to the store a minute ago.

286
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,286
Archie. Archie!

287
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,749
- Here I am, Mac.
- See when Mr Ringo's horse will be ready.

288
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:38,540
- And hurry up, Archie.
- All right, Mac.

289
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:44,304
- Mac, Ringo don't look so tough to me.
- Then go in there and take a punch at him.

290
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,090
For what? I ain't got nothing against the man.

291
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,594
Here's the marshal. He'll shoot Ringo.

292
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:54,264
He can't. He don't even carry a gun.

293
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,899
Why aren't you kids in school?

294
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:10,659
Nothing doing, Jimmie. She says
she's sorry but that's all there is to it.

295
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,826
- Did you say it was important?
- I told her what I told you,

296
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:18,371
and offered to fix it up for her on the quiet
if she wanted to see you.

297
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,633
- What else?
- What else what?

298
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,003
Are you sure you didn't talk against me?

299
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,514
Who's asking the dumb questions now?

300
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,176
Didn't she give no explanation at all?

301
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:36,598
What explanation could she give
that you don't already know?

302
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:44,030
If I could only talk to her
for just a few minutes.

303
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,655
How does she look, Mark?

304
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:54,166
Just about the same, I guess.
A little older but just as pretty.

305
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,211
- Did you see my boy?
- No. He's on the loose today.

306
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,419
- What do you mean?
- Do you hear those boys on the street?

307
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:03,799
Yeah.

308
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,006
He's one of them.

309
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,262
Which one, Mark?

310
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,234
Well, I...

311
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,521
I don't see him right now.

312
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,571
If that ain't a fine way to bring up a kid,
hanging around a saloon!

313
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,739
- Ain't you got a school in this town?
- Yep.

314
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:38,752
We've got a school here.
You broke it up, partner.

315
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:44,587
They all come down to see Jimmie Ringo.
The big gun. The great hero.

316
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:51,222
Does my... Does my kid
think I'm kind of a hero?

317
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,055
Nope. As a matter of fact,
I understand he's a Wyatt Earp man.

318
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:59,689
- Earp? You ought to have taught him better.
- Me? Where was you all this time?

319
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,476
I beg your pardon, both of you gentlemen,
for interrupting you,

320
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,692
but this is a serious situation for me, Marshal.

321
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,151
What is it?

322
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:14,367
The truth of the matter, sir,
is that Wes Fuller is burning my house down.

323
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,247
- What's he doing that for?
- Well...

324
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:23,083
he just felt like it, Marshal. That's the only
excuse in the worid he's got. Just felt like it.

325
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:28,548
- Drunk?
- He certainly don't act altogether cold sober.

326
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,428
We'll go and see what we can do.
Wait outside.

327
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,759
Yes, sir.

328
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:37,678
And thank you too, sir, Mr Ringo. It ain't
like me to interrupt two gentlemen like you.

329
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,687
- Go on out, I said.
- Yes, sir.

330
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,863
- Are you moving on now?
- I guess so.

331
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,696
- Sorry it had to be like this, Jimmie.
- It's not your fault.

332
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,532
Watch yourself, partner.

333
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,124
If I write to you, will you give her a message?

334
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,706
- You bet.
- Thanks, Mark.

335
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:07,248
- I'll be seeing you, Jimmie.
- I hope so. But don't lay no money on it.

336
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,964
I'll be seeing you, all right.

337
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,229
- How much, Mac?
- No charge. It's an honour to have you.

338
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,809
Thanks.

339
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,358
Here he comes!

340
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,770
Don't grab this from your wife.

341
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,611
It's an honour and a pleasure,
Jimmie. Yes, sir.

342
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,652
We're old-timers, you know, you and me.

343
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,573
Jimmie!

344
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,079
Molly.

345
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:47,713
- I didn't know you were here.
- You must be about the only one in town.

346
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,716
- I work late so I sleep late.
- Work where?

347
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,004
- Here.
- What do you mean?

348
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,174
I'm a singer.
You've heard of singers, haven't you?

349
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,093
Want to buy me a little drink?

350
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,934
Sure, kid. Sure. But why?

351
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,645
Gotta live, haven't you?

352
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,687
But where's Bucky?

353
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,486
- Didn't you hear?
- Hear what?

354
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,243
Buck was killed six months ago in Abilene.

355
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,623
No, I didn't hear.

356
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,956
I'm sorry, Molly. Who did it?

357
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:31,466
I don't know. He was found in an alley,
shot through the back of the head.

358
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,130
Didn't he...
Didn't he leave you anything?

359
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:40,550
A horse and a saddle,
two guns and fifteen dollars.

360
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:45,264
I never heard a word about it, Molly.

361
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,932
Have you seen Peg?

362
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,067
Nope.

363
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,155
- Do you?
- Whenever I can.

364
00:33:54,449 --> 00:34:00,992
Doesn't do a schoolteacher any good
to be seen with a barroom singer, you know.

365
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,872
Come on over here for a minute.

366
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,126
There's something I want to ask you.

367
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,084
Peggy wouldn't see me. Is it somebody else?

368
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,970
- You ought to know better than that.
- I don't. It's been a long time.

369
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:22,179
- There'll never be anybody else for Peg.
- Anybody else tried?

370
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,390
Of course. Pretty girl like that.

371
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:29,023
Young squirt named
Hunt Bromley got after her.

372
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,604
Boy, you should have heard her tell him off.

373
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,986
- What did he do to her?
- Nothing.

374
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:39,743
Nothing, really. Just a barroom loafer trying
to move in on a woman without a husband.

375
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,948
You know the kind.

376
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:46,871
- Do you see Jimmie too?
- Whenever I see her.

377
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,503
- What kind of a boy is he?
- He's a good kid. Peg takes good care of him.

378
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:55,337
- What is he? Big or little?
- Big. About right for eight.

379
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,547
Eight and a half.

380
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,141
- Look, do you want me to talk to Peg?
- Mark already talked to her. She said no.

381
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,973
Let me talk to her.

382
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,396
Are you in some kind of a hurry?

383
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:14,402
- If there's a chance, I'll stick around.
- You stay right here. I'll get her for you.

384
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:19,566
- Don't take too long. I'm behind schedule.
- I won't be long.

385
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,086
Hiya, Hunt.

386
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,638
Deal me out.

387
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,902
Deal me back in again.

388
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:05,987
- I'll bet two bits.
- That finishes me.

389
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,746
I don't want no more of it.

390
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:11,250
- Your deal, Joe.
- Sit in for a couple of hands, Johnny?

391
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,036
With cards I made?
I wouldn't want to do that.

392
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,207
What do they mean,
playing cards on a day like this?

393
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,627
- Looks like any other day to me.
- You mean you ain't heard?

394
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,672
- Heard what?
- You ain't heard who's in town?

395
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:28,718
Do you have to put your foot on my chair?
We ain't been out of here since Tuesday.

396
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,387
- Who is it?
- Jimmie Ringo.

397
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,101
- Jimmie Ringo?
- tJh-huh.

398
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,517
What is Jimmie Ringo doing in Cayenne?

399
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,653
- Sitting right up there at the Palace Bar.
- Now?

400
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:42,315
- Yeah. We just left him there.
- What does he look like?

401
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,735
He don't look much different
from a lot of other fellas.

402
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,121
He looks mighty average
to be such a big man.

403
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:53,626
- About as big as they come, I guess.
- How many hands has he got?

404
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,707
I never counted them.

405
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,292
He's got two hands, just like anybody else.

406
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:03,586
And somebody's gonna make a big name
for himself by proving that's all he's got.

407
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,130
A big name, right on his tombstone.

408
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:10,427
It's gotta come sooner or later.
You don't expect him to go on forever.

409
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,096
So far as I'm concerned, he can.

410
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,105
Do you reckon he's still up there?

411
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,188
Wait. You're good,
but maybe you ain't that good.

412
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:22,105
- How do you know I ain't?
- If you ain't, can I have your saddle?

413
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,739
Very funny.

414
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:28,198
What I mean, Hunt, you ain't ever
really killed anybody like he has.

415
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:32,991
What do you know? You don't know
everything I've done or every place I've been.

416
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:37,378
But you ain't ever been
any place but Abilene, have you?

417
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:41,256
Come on, let's go up and take a look
at this big, important man.

418
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,965
- I ain't finished cutting your hair yet.
- I'll come back.

419
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,301
He ain't too sociable.
Might not like people looking at him.

420
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,971
- He can get used to it. What about it, Ike?
- I got a wife and a couple of kids, Hunt.

421
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,606
I'd better not either.
I got a mother who's my sole support.

422
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,860
Suit yourself, yellow-bellies.

423
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,441
He never was much fun
to have around, anyway.

424
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,262
Rye.

425
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,639
- Jimmie!
- You're Jimmie Walsh, ain't you?

426
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:34,928
- Ain't that your ma calling you?
- Jimmie, come here right this minute.

427
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,816
- Just a minute, Ma.
- If you don't come here, I'll skin you alive.

428
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:45,275
Aw, shucks! Tell me which one gets killed,
will you? But, Ma, the other fellas will see it.

429
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,066
I don't care what the other boys do.
You're coming home with me.

430
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:54,330
Jimmie Ringo's there and so is Hunt.
Somebody's gonna get shot. I want to see it.

431
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:07,669
Since when do I have to drink
second-grade whisky here, Mac?

432
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:13,137
- That's the brand you always drink, Hunt.
- This whisky has been watered.

433
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,643
No, it ain't, Hunt.
You know I don't water my whisky.

434
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:20,477
If I say it's watered, it's watered.
I'll prove it to you.

435
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:24,485
Give everybody a drink out of that bottle
and let's see what they say.

436
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:29,774
- There ain't a thing the matter with it.
- Did you hear what I said, or not?

437
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,945
I heard.

438
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:42,370
And don't forget the gentleman at the table.
I'd like to have his opinion too.

439
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,048
Please, let's don't have no trouble here now.

440
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,254
I'll ask him myself.

441
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,424
I want you to settle a little argument.

442
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,772
Why should I?

443
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:10,360
- You've a reputation for settling arguments.
- Only my own.

444
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,526
You could say this one included you in a way.

445
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,787
I say Mac waters his whisky.

446
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,495
Then you're kind of dumb
to be drinking here, ain't you?

447
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:25,037
- Taste this and tell me what you think.
- Don't trouble yourself.

448
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,380
You ain't very sociable, are you?
Maybe if you got to know me a little better.

449
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,418
I don't have to know you any better.

450
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:36,557
Looks to me like there's a squirt like you in
every town in the West. Get away from here.

451
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:40,310
That's kind of strong talk, ain't it, Mr Ringo?

452
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:44,724
- You're Hunt Bromley, ain't you?
- Yeah. You heard of me already?

453
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:49,817
Yeah, I heard about you. I heard
you're a cheap, no-good barroom loafer.

454
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:54,779
If I didn't have something on my mind, I'd
take those guns and slap you cross-eyed.

455
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:58,287
You're asking for trouble, Mr Ringo.

456
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,244
You already got it, partner.

457
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:07,334
Cos I got a gun on you under this table
and it's pointing smack at your belly.

458
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:10,750
Now, you gonna get out of here, or not?

459
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,887
I'm kind of disappointed in you, Mr Ringo.

460
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:20,222
We heard a lot about you, but I guess they
forgot to tell us about the gun under the table.

461
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:26,187
The older you grow, the more you learn, son.
Now turn around and head for the door.

462
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:34,398
Keep moving and don't do
anything sudden with your hands.

463
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,164
- I'll be seeing you, Mr Ringo.
- All the way outside, sonny.

464
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,605
What on earth?

465
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:19,026
We need three horses quick, Mr Barlow.
Can you let us have them?

466
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,536
I don't see any reason why not.

467
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:26,292
Marty, saddle up Prince, Fanny and Dan
for these men right away.

468
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:31,627
- You got some guns too?
- I guess I have, but what are you fellas up to?

469
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:35,838
- How far is it to Cayenne?
- It's about an hour's ride.

470
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:39,380
If you start now,
you could make it by ten o'clock easy.

471
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,049
But ain't you gonna tell me what's going on?

472
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,593
We're after Jimmie Ringo.

473
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,808
Jimmie Ringo?

474
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,360
I was the only fella in town
that didn't see him.

475
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:58,152
- What's the matter?
- Ma won't let me see Jimmie Ringo.

476
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:03,116
You bet I won't. You're going straight up
to your room until that man's left this town.

477
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:07,249
- I don't want to go to my room.
- I don't care what you want to do.

478
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,659
Please, Mom.

479
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:15,299
Now you stay in there. And don't let me hear
another word out of you about it.

480
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:22,048
Did you ever hear of anything so terrible?
It's like the town's gone crazy.

481
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,684
- He's here just to see you.
- Have you talked to him?

482
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:30,348
I just left him. Why don't you see him,
if only for a few minutes?

483
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,563
Molly, what good would it do?

484
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:38,731
- It's all over now, you know that.
- Not for him. He's still crazy about you.

485
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:43,528
He was crazy about me before, but that didn't
stop him from being the person he was.

486
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,288
He scares me, Molly. He really does.

487
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:50,451
He might have scared you then but not now.
He's different.

488
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,369
How different?

489
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:55,210
The way Bucky was different that last year.

490
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:59,843
You know, not wild any more. Just sorry.

491
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,255
And what good did it do Bucky?

492
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,971
None, I guess. But I liked it.

493
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:09,012
If only he'd have stayed away.

494
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,394
Is it somebody else, Peggy?

495
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,435
Of course not. You know it's not.

496
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,272
Not Mark?

497
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,609
Mark?

498
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,274
- Why do ask that?
- Is it?

499
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:26,366
I've never even thought of Mark like that.
Of course not.

500
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,657
- You think he never thought of you like that?
- I doubt it.

501
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,575
Mark's just...

502
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:35,872
Well, Mark's just Mark. He's Jim's friend.

503
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,375
You must be out of your mind.

504
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,420
Then it's still Jim, isn't it?

505
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,925
I guess so.

506
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,180
I guess it always will be.

507
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:09,788
How would you like to see
Ringo and Wyatt Earp square off?

508
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,916
I wouldn't want to be
in the same town when that happened.

509
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:18,002
I still say he's yellow. I gave him the chance
to show how good he was, didn't I?

510
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,337
You reckon he didn't have
a gun under the table after all?

511
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:26,347
I heard that. But both his hands were out of
sight, he could have been holding anything.

512
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,349
It took lots of nerve, though, to bluff like that.

513
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:34,105
- What would you have done? Looked?
- I wouldn't even have been there.

514
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,186
He was the one that ducked out
of a showdown not me.

515
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:41,195
- You ain't going back?
- I ain't leaving town, if that's what you mean.

516
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,448
Marshal wants to see you.
Didn't you get the message?

517
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,825
Yeah, I got it. I'll see him.

518
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,031
When I get the time.

519
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,706
He says now.

520
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,621
Looks like everybody's
drawing behind your back.

521
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:04,544
All the smart ones.
Come on down the marshal's office.

522
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,837
I'll be right behind you.

523
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,804
Just you wait until Mrs Pennyfeather
hears about this situation.

524
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,980
There he is. Charlie's got him!

525
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:25,398
Aw, shucks! That's just Hunt Bromley.
Ringo wouldn't spit on Hunt Bromley.

526
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,612
Come on.

527
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,487
What do you want with me?

528
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,749
Sit down. Didn't you get my message?

529
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,705
I'm here, ain't I?

530
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,872
How come you tried
to pick a fight with Ringo?

531
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,462
You don't have to worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

532
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,253
I wish I had $100 for every blabbermouth
I've heard say that.

533
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,094
He's yellow. I learned that much anyway.

534
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:58,140
All right, then, Buffalo Bill. I see it ain't no use
to warn you, so I'm gonna tell you.

535
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:02,856
Either I lock you up in a cell until he's gone,
or you get out of town for the rest of day.

536
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,989
- Which is it gonna be?
- Me get out of town? What about him?

537
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:11,402
When you're the marshal you can do
the deciding, meanwhile let me handle it.

538
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:14,117
Now, what do you like? The cell or the road?

539
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,123
Looks like you're being
careful about that killer.

540
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:22,129
I just don't want any great, big, terrible men
like you scaring him to death.

541
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,211
- How long you known Ringo?
- You want to be locked up?

542
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,126
- No.
- Then get going. South.

543
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:32,218
I don't want to see you back around here
before sundown. tJnderstand?

544
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,473
You didn't say how long you knew Ringo.

545
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:39,104
If you ain't out of town in five minutes,
I'll have to take them guns away from you.

546
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:43,893
- Don't ever try that, Mark.
- I won't try it, I'll do it.

547
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,739
I got my mind made up now.

548
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:58,787
I'm gonna keep peace here today if I have
to lock up every gunny in town to do it.

549
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,372
Where's your badge?

550
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:06,711
Put it on. This is official. I want you to take
this scatter-gun and sit in the Palace with it.

551
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,968
If Hunt or any other troublemaker comes,
let him have it.

552
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,675
What's Ringo gonna think,
me with a shotgun?

553
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,306
Tell him I sent you.

554
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,354
How long have you known Ringo, Mark?

555
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:29,237
I'm gonna keep Hunt company
for a mile or so.

556
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:37,745
- I'll be back in a few minutes.
- Yes, sir.

557
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,564
Mr Ringo, I...

558
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,856
I'm Charlie Norris, Mr Ringo.
Mark Strett's deputy.

559
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:16,402
- Mark wants me to sit shotgun at the door.
- With what?

560
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:21,699
I didn't bring it in with me because
I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.

561
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,835
- Who is he?
- He's the deputy, like he says.

562
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,337
- Where's Mark?
- He had to go out.

563
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,044
He'll be along in a few minutes.

564
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,676
All right, get your gun.
We'll have a drink at the bar.

565
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,883
Thank you, Mr Ringo.

566
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,469
Is that clock right?

567
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,730
Not more than five or
ten minutes out either way.

568
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,654
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- Not if you don't mind if I don't answer it.

569
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:03,369
Who would you say
was the toughest man you ever saw?

570
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,034
I'll tell you the second toughest.
Bucky Harris.

571
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:10,001
- You ever tangle with him?
- Of course not. Bucky was my friend.

572
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:14,543
Take it you don't want me
to ask you again who was the first toughest.

573
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,132
Looks like your business is on the outside.

574
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,469
That don't worry me none. Wait till tomorrow.

575
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:24,603
- After I'm gone, huh?
- This place'll be famous. It'll be like a shrine.

576
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:27,605
I'll probably have to put on
two more bartenders.

577
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,017
Maybe I ought to charge you a fee.

578
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,812
You name it, Jimmie, and it's yours.

579
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:38,108
- Are you serious?
- Why not? You done it.

580
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,700
- All right, I'll take it.
- It's a deal. Who's gonna collect for you?

581
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,615
I'll let you know before I leave.

582
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,795
- Where you going?
- I can't stand waiting. I'll take a look around.

583
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,207
All right, but I gotta stay with you.

584
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:08,188
- How much do you get paid for this job?
- 60 a month. Why?

585
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,225
- It ain't enough.
- What happened?

586
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:15,771
There's a fella with a gun
in one of them windows across the street.

587
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,816
If I hadn't seen the sun flash on it,
you might've got it.

588
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:22,361
- Which window?
- Stay away from the door.

589
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:25,952
- You wait here.
- But you ain't supposed to leave here.

590
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,460
I gotta get the gun away from that fella.
He'll mess up this whole business.

591
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,839
- Who do you reckon it is?
- I don't know. But I ought to go after him.

592
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,592
- Why don't you?
- Mark said stay here.

593
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,550
I ain't got orders
covering a situation like this.

594
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:44,224
Anyway, he's still in there.

595
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:48,102
Jerry, please. Won't you give it up, please?

596
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:52,516
Nothing is going to bring Roy back
and that's all we're thinking about.

597
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,936
Go outside and take a look.

598
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:02,321
If you want to find out who's getting ready
to shoot through that door, look yourself.

599
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:06,990
- You're the man in charge of peace.
- Peace, the man says.

600
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:10,375
- You better get out of here.
- It's my life too, Jerry.

601
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:15,710
Go over to Ella Mae's and stay there.
Keep your mouth shut.

602
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,920
All right.

603
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,997
Don't move. Drop that gun.

604
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,752
Drop it.

605
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,790
Put your hands up.
Kick it away from you.

606
00:52:58,092 --> 00:52:59,754
Further away.

607
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,964
Now stand up.

608
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:10,518
Now, turn around.
Let's see what you look like.

609
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,935
I ought to blow your head off,
laying for me like that.

610
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:20,025
- Can I put my hands down?
- Sure. Just don't try anything funny.

611
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:23,565
- What's the idea?
- My name is Marlowe. You don't remember?

612
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,824
- No.
- You don't remember Roy Marlowe?

613
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,113
Come on, keep talking.
What are you getting at?

614
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:31,907
Roy Marlowe was my son. You killed him.

615
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:36,420
I never killed any Roy Marlowe.
I never even heard of him.

616
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:40,253
You killed him all right,
but you don't even remember it.

617
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:43,419
You're crazy to think I wouldn't remember it.

618
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,303
Are you sure?

619
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:55,018
You're not safe running around loose.
You've gotta be locked up. Come on.

620
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,105
Open it.

621
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,566
Now, move ahead of me.

622
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,446
Back stairs.

623
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,748
To the marshal's office.

624
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,667
You think I ought to go across there?

625
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:24,960
- Mark told you to stay here, didn't he?
- Thank you.

626
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:53,285
It looks like we've gotta
serve ourselves today. Come on.

627
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:16,728
- Where is he?
- He ought to be here.

628
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:21,725
I am Mrs August Pennyfeather.

629
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:28,277
- How do you do, Mrs Pennyfeather?
- We are here to see Marshal Mark Strett.

630
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,739
He ain't here now, ma'am.
I don't know just where he is.

631
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,949
We will wait.

632
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,907
Yes, ma'am, do.

633
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,535
Won't you have a chair?

634
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,626
Who are you? A deputy?

635
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,382
No. Just a friend.

636
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:51,092
He wouldn't be over there
arresting that murderer, would he?

637
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:55,009
- No, ma'am, I don't think he is.
- Doesn't he intend to?

638
00:55:55,310 --> 00:56:00,396
That I couldn't say, ma'am.
I ain't sure just what he's gonna do about it.

639
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,479
He'd better be making up
his mind pretty soon.

640
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:07,737
This is not Deadwood or Tombstone.
This is a law-abiding community.

641
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:12,742
We want no murderers running through our
streets, shooting our women and children.

642
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,403
He ain't exactly running through the streets.

643
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,618
- He's a murderer, isn't he?
- Is he?

644
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:23,457
- What else, pray tell, after all those killings?
- I mean, maybe he don't think he is.

645
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,372
- Then he must be a fool too.
- I'm just guessing,

646
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:31,010
but maybe he figures
it was either him or them.

647
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,762
What do you mean?

648
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:36,675
I mean, maybe there was
some misunderstandings,

649
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:39,811
and it was either him or them
that was gonna get killed.

650
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,017
50 misunderstandings in a row?

651
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:45,354
Not 50, ma'am. Nowheres near it.

652
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:49,362
It was a lot nearer 15 than 50,
and I can tell you that for a fact.

653
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,069
What are you trying to do? Take up for him?

654
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,359
No, ma'am. No indeed, not me.

655
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,404
Don't you think something
should be done about him?

656
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:01,165
Absolutely. He ought to be arrested
or run out of town, or something.

657
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,372
He ought to be hung.

658
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:10,258
Yes, ma'am. There's a lot to be said
for that point of view too.

659
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:15,172
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, Marshal.

660
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,342
- You're late.
- Late?

661
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:24,731
Yes, ma'am. I figured
you'd be around long before now.

662
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:29,190
- What do you intend to do about the man?
- Nothing, ma'am.

663
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:34,904
You're going to allow him to sit in that saloon
as he pleases, demoralising the whole town?

664
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:40,072
The trouble ain't been him demoralising
the town. It's the town demoralising him.

665
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:44,744
Some fella just tried to demoralise him
with a Winchester. Is that what you mean?

666
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:50,791
We are here simply to remind you that it is
your sworn duty to keep peace in Cayenne.

667
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:54,962
That's right. And that's what I am aiming
to do to the best of my ability.

668
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,006
Moreover, we, the ladies of Cayenne,

669
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:02,552
regard it an outrage that this man Ringo,
a notorious murderer,

670
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,346
should be received practically with honour

671
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:09,359
and allowed to sit in state
in our finest saloon.

672
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:14,773
So now we demand, Mr Marshal,
that you do something about it immediately.

673
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,862
Such as what, ma'am?

674
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,619
Either arrest him or chase him out of town.

675
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:26,376
- What do you think?
- He's planning to leave anyway, ain't he?

676
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,332
That's the way I understand it.

677
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,748
What do you figure would happen
if I tried to chase him out?

678
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:37,387
I don't think you could do it
and keep the peace at the same time.

679
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:40,594
- That's what I thought.
- Can't you arrest him?

680
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:44,181
- He's done nothing here to be arrested for.
- Isn't he wanted?

681
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:47,768
- Not by me, ma'am.
- I'm just a stranger here myself, ma'am.

682
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,025
If you was to ask me,
I'd say hold off for another hour.

683
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:55,404
Don't do anything that might make trouble
until, say, half past ten.

684
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:58,783
If he ain't gone by then,
let the marshal go to work on him.

685
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,911
- Shoot him down like a dog.
- Exactly, ma'am.

686
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,948
That sounds very sensible.
What do you say, ladies?

687
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:09,790
Then that's the way we'll have it.
Thank you very much.

688
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:14,298
- That's a very reasonable, intelligent idea.
- Don't thank me. Thank Mr Ringo.

689
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:18,382
But of course.
Thank you very much, Mr Ringo.

690
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,842
Mr Ringo?!

691
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:23,053
Ladies! Ladies, please!

692
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:36,480
- I saw Molly. She said she'd talk to Peggy.
- I know. She's down there now.

693
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:39,399
- I'd better get back to the Palace.
- Where's Marlowe?

694
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,567
- Who?
- The fella in the window.

695
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:45,614
I arrested him for you. He's back there.
Are you gonna let him out?

696
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:50,752
Not until you leave town.
Wait a minute. I'm going with you.

697
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,039
I forgot something, Mark.

698
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,468
- Where was your boy killed?
- You don't know?

699
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:03,052
What would I be asking you for if I knew?

700
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,342
Tulsa.

701
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:10,059
Wasn't me, partner. I've never
even been in the territory in my life.

702
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:16,277
- When will them brothers be here?
- I've got plenty of time.

703
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,813
I hope so. I hope you ain't miscalculated.

704
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:24,453
They're on foot. I chased off their horses.
They'll do good if they're here by eleven.

705
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:34,500
- I've seen better fights at a prayer meeting.
- They ain't got as much spirit.

706
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,710
Go for his eyes.

707
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:48,180
Jake, is that horse in any shape
to go again today?

708
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,846
No, I don't think so, Mark.
He's near worn down to a nubbin.

709
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,641
- You got a fresh one here?
- I guess so. Why?

710
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:59,278
Have him at the back door of the Palace
in 15 minutes, saddled with Ringo's stuff.

711
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:02,532
Give him some grub and water
and charge it to the county.

712
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,738
All right, Mark.

713
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,971
Anybody working here today?

714
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,178
Too busy to work today.

715
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,723
- Hiya, Mac.
- Tommy. Glad to see you.

716
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,108
- Looks like Saturday.
- How's Ellen?

717
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,234
Fine, thanks. Give me a rye.

718
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:43,489
- What'll Ellen say?
- She said I could have one if it was dusty.

719
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,651
- Wife don't like him to drink.
- Don't blame her.

720
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:50,663
She knows I'm all over that sort of thing.
Too much work to do these days.

721
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:55,201
- Join me?
- Thanks. I'll have the same thing.

722
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,715
- What you got, a ranch?
- We got it the first year we was married.

723
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:03,046
It ain't very big but it's coming along.

724
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:09,012
Married the cutest little girl you ever saw.
But did she settle this rounder down?

725
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:13,178
That's her, all right.
Little, but oh my!

726
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,770
- How many head of cattle you got?
- About 400. Started at 50.

727
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,435
- Got horses too?
- We ain't got many.

728
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:25,323
You need more outside help than we can
afford for horses, but I guess we got about 30.

729
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:29,327
- Sounds like a right nice start.
- That's the way her and I figured it.

730
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:33,706
Takes hard work to make anything out of
a place that little, but we don't mind.

731
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,210
Grazing land's good, there's plenty of water,
so we're better off than many.

732
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,167
We broke even last year.

733
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,833
Sounds mighty good.
Have one with me.

734
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:48,755
No, thanks. One is what she said.
Much obliged to you, though. So long, Mac.

735
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:53,518
- So long, Tommy. Tell Ellen hello for me.
- Yeah, I'll tell her.

736
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:55,724
Nice fella, Tommy.

737
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:02,526
Kinda getting on towards time, ain't it?

738
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:07,357
- I'll give her till the last minute.
- You don't wanna draw it too close.

739
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:10,242
I gotta hear something,
no matter how close I draw it.

740
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:13,951
If Molly ain't back pretty soon...

741
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:19,627
She told me about Bucky.
Never heard it before.

742
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,880
I guess he never knew what hit him.

743
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:29,800
It's a fine life, ain't it?
Just trying to stay alive.

744
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:34,217
Not really living, not enjoying anything,
not getting anywhere.

745
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:38,433
- Just trying to keep from getting killed.
- That's what Bucky used to say.

746
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:42,100
Just waiting to get knocked off
by some tough kid.

747
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,485
Like the kind of kid I was.

748
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:49,865
And the truth of the matter is,
it don't pay much either.

749
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,450
Here I am: 35 years old,
I ain't even got a good watch.

750
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,212
- How'd you get out of it, Mark?
- I just quit.

751
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:08,091
It ain't that easy. How'd you do it, really?

752
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,467
Remember when the gang
split up after that bank?

753
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:16,134
- We didn't split up. They scattered us.
- Well, anyway.

754
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:19,099
Some of us put into
Prairie City to get supplies.

755
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:22,481
But the word was out.
You should have seen what we walked into.

756
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,267
Yeah, I heard.

757
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,232
- Did you hear about the little girl?
- No.

758
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,113
I got sick when I saw her.

759
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:36,784
- Who did it?
- It could have been me as well as anybody.

760
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:39,995
- You don't know that.
- It don't matter. I was there.

761
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,956
So when we got back to the hills,
I kept a-going.

762
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:46,213
I kept on a-going until I got here
and I asked a man for ajob.

763
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:50,092
Didn't anybody ever say anything?

764
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,130
I wasn't as prominent as you are.

765
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,478
- It's funny, ain't it?
- What?

766
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:09,653
That was the time
I could've kept on a-going too.

767
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,493
I could've rode right on back to Peggy.

768
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:21,328
I used to wonder about going back
and giving myself up.

769
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,619
I finally argued myself
out of that one, thank goodness.

770
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,583
- Mark?
- Yeah?

771
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:31,751
- I've got that horse out here.
- Be there in a minute, Jake.

772
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:35,880
Well...

773
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:39,266
I guess it ain't much use
my waiting around here any longer.

774
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,429
You can write to me
and I'll give it to her if you want.

775
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,268
It won't do any good.
She's got her mind made up.

776
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:48,560
No place she could reach you, I reckon.

777
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,353
No.

778
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,614
I don't know where I am gonna be.

779
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:57,739
- So long, Mac.
- Do you have to be going already?

780
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,120
Yes. I gotta see a fella up the line.

781
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:04,580
What about your cut of the business?
Who do you want me to give it to?

782
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:07,120
Who's the prettiest girl in town?

783
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:13,089
I used to admire the banker's daughter, but
I might have been influenced by her money.

784
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,969
There's Frankie Mae. And the schoolteacher.

785
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:21,976
Give it to the schoolteacher. I've always
had a weakness for schoolteachers.

786
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:26,685
Put it in an envelope without any note
or anything, and drop it on her desk.

787
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:31,193
Schoolteacher. Consider it done.
It's been a real pleasure to see you again.

788
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:36,074
I often think of the good old days in Dodge
City, with you and Bucky and the others.

789
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:37,903
Them was the good old days.

790
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:39,819
Come on, Jimmie.

791
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:43,205
I don't think people have fun
like they used to. Do you?

792
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,741
No.

793
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,456
Jim, got a minute or two?

794
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,770
You look fine, honey.

795
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:09,273
I'm doing all right.

796
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,066
I... come here just to see you, you know.

797
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,482
I know. Mark told me.

798
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,572
But I just didn't know what to do, Jim.

799
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,113
It's all right now.

800
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:31,663
- How's Jimmie?
- He's a lot like you, I'm afraid.

801
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:35,174
Don't you think you'd better do
something about that quick?

802
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,255
I was just joking.

803
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:41,639
He's a little wild, like all kids,
but he's a good boy.

804
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,765
D'you know he's out in front now?

805
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,020
I took him away once, but it looks like
the whole town's crazy today.

806
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:51,102
- I never saw anything like it.
- I looked out there.

807
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,859
I couldn't see no kid that looked like me.

808
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,645
He's still there, I'm afraid.

809
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:01,317
- Mark and Molly tell you what I want?
- No.

810
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:05,659
I wanna get away from here.
I wanna get out of this part of the country.

811
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:11,419
See if we can't find us a little ranch, maybe.
You and me and Jimmie.

812
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:14,877
- If only you'd thought of this before.
- We can still do it.

813
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:19,384
I could go to California or the Northwest,
where they ain't never heard of me.

814
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,549
See if I couldn't find us a little place. Then
you and Jimmie could come on out later.

815
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:29,937
They would never know who we were. We
could be safe out there the rest of our lives.

816
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,268
When did you get this idea, Jim?

817
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:37,062
I didn't get it. It just kinda come over me.
The way getting older comes over you.

818
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:41,733
All of a sudden, you look at things different
than the way you did five years ago.

819
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:45,824
All of a sudden, I knew this was
the only thing in the worid I wanted.

820
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:51,163
You and me and Jimmie,
together on a little place somewhere.

821
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:54,332
It's a wonderful idea, Jim.

822
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:59,125
It's wonderful, but it's no use.

823
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,669
- Why not?
- It's too late.

824
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,588
- Why? Mark done it.
- Eight years ago.

825
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:08,305
But you couldn't. Not now.
You're too well known.

826
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:12,893
The only reason Mark doesn't arrest you
is that he's Mark and you're his friend.

827
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:15,808
But you can't depend
on things like that forever.

828
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:20,480
One of these days, the federal officers'll
pick up your trail. That'll be the end of it.

829
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:24,241
They'll never give up, not as long as you live.

830
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:30,782
What about South America? We can meet
in New Orleans, get on a boat and...

831
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,201
What's the matter, Peggy?

832
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,669
Don't you love me?

833
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,085
- You didn't have to ask that.
- I've changed, you know.

834
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:49,601
I'm different now, Peg. I just want
to be somewhere. Don't you understand?

835
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,931
Look, darling.

836
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,847
If it were just you and me, I'd do it.

837
01:09:55,149 --> 01:10:00,235
I'd go with you this very minute
anywhere in the worid you wanted to go.

838
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:03,238
But it's not just you and me.
There's Jimmie too.

839
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:06,697
- We can take him with us.
- No, Jim.

840
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:11,955
We could run and hide
and dodge the law the rest of our lives.

841
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,788
Not a little boy like him.

842
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:18,545
He wouldn't understand. Don't you see?

843
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,082
Jimmie.

844
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:25,128
- Give me another minute, will you?
- It's quarter past ten, Jimmie.

845
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,922
It's all right. I've got time, they're walking.

846
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,466
They could have run some too, you know.

847
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:33,886
All right. Just one more minute.

848
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:38,102
- Somebody's after you.
- Never mind that. Listen.

849
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:40,518
A year from now, if I come back,

850
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:44,313
if I've been all right the whole year,
will you talk to me about it?

851
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:48,609
- No, it's no use. It's too late.
- Just talk to me, that's all.

852
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:52,029
Maybe you'll feel different.
Something might have happened.

853
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,789
Nobody knows what can happen in a year.

854
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:58,668
But you gotta say
you'll talk to me about it again.

855
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:00,670
I will.

856
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:05,418
We can make it, honey. We can make it.

857
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,088
You just wait and see.

858
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,302
- Where are you, Grandma?
- Look...

859
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:15,015
Listen to me, Mark.
I got to have five minutes more.

860
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:16,804
You ain't got the time.

861
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:21,976
I know what I'm doing. Those guys don't have
any horses. What are they gonna do? Fly?

862
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,191
- What do you want five minutes for?
- I want to see my kid.

863
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:27,322
- No, you can't.
- Now look...

864
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,781
I'm sorry but my mind is made up.
So get him, honey.

865
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:33,741
I don't care how you do it
but get him in this room.

866
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:38,660
- Are you trying to mess everything up?
- I just want to see my kid.

867
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:42,921
- How can I fix it so he won't know?
- You can do it. You'll think of something.

868
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:48,883
But I ain't leaving until I see him.
Alone, me and him, right here in this room.

869
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,218
I don't care if there's 300 brothers.

870
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,176
Can you hurry it up?

871
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:58,391
I'll try.

872
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:02,437
It's been eight years
since I've seen my own kid.

873
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:07,321
And it ain't gonna be another eight years
before I see him again.

874
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:11,325
You wait here. I'm surely glad
you don't drop in every morning.

875
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,367
- Where's Charlie?
- Stepped outside.

876
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:22,082
- Tell him to come in here right away.
- Sure.

877
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:27,837
Jimmie. Jimmie Walsh. Jimmie!

878
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,172
- Ain't that your ma calling?
- Yes, sir.

879
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,929
Come here. Hurry, Jimmie.

880
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:35,011
But, Ma! All the other fellas...

881
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:40,930
Never mind the other fellas. Molly wants
to tell you something. Come on with me.

882
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:43,975
- Do you know his horse?
- I know it.

883
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:24,311
- Who learned you to bust into a room?
- Nobody.

884
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:29,570
Don't ever do it again. You knock first and
wait till somebody answers. tJnderstand?

885
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,947
Yes, sir.

886
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,571
Now, shut the door.

887
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:45,081
Miss Molly Harris said you wanted to see me.

888
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,376
- Yeah. That's right.
- What about?

889
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,337
I'll tell you in a minute.

890
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,598
- How old are you?
- Nine.

891
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,860
- You're eight and a half.
- How'd you know?

892
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,487
I've got my ways.

893
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:18,285
- What grade are you in?
- Third. Honest.

894
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,992
You know what grade I was in
when I was your age?

895
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,997
- What?
- The seventh.

896
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:28,162
- At eight and a half?
- Well... I was in the sixth, anyway.

897
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:32,128
You was in the sixth grade
at eight and a half?

898
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:36,091
I wasn't far from it.

899
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:40,466
Are you really Jimmie Ringo?

900
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:43,511
Sure I am. What do you mean?

901
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:46,521
How come you didn't draw
when I kicked in that door?

902
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:50,730
Draw on an unarmed man?
I never did that in my life.

903
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,896
You gotta give everybody
a fair chance, don't you?

904
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,611
Did you ever meet Wyatt Earp?

905
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,493
Yeah. I seen him once or twice.

906
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:03,952
Was he the toughest man you ever saw?

907
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:09,041
In the bunch I ran with, we'd have spanked
Wyatt Earp's britches with his own pistol.

908
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:12,331
- Really?
- The real tough ones would laugh at Earp.

909
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:17,128
- Who is the toughest one you ever saw?
- You mean the real toughest?

910
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,298
Yes, sir. Besides you.

911
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:25,515
I guess I've never seen anybody any tougher
than a fella you've got here in your own town.

912
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:28,772
- Fella by the name of Mark Strett.
- Marshal Mark Strett?

913
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:32,980
- He's the toughest man I ever met.
- But he don't even carry a gun.

914
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:37,319
He don't have to, son.
He can handle them barehanded.

915
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:40,780
And we've been calling him a softy.

916
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:45,322
All I can say is,
don't you ever tangle with that softy.

917
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,536
No, sir.

918
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:54,664
What's the matter?

919
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,879
Nothing.

920
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:07,436
- I thought Jimmie Ringo was in here.
- He was. Had a drink where you're standing.

921
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:10,973
- Ain't left town, has he?
- Not yet. He got held up back there.

922
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,187
Well.

923
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,032
You watch here.

924
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,595
Now I'll tell you what I wanted with you.
You see them kids out front?

925
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:43,755
- Yes.
- Why ain't they in school?

926
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:46,675
We come down to see what's going on.

927
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:51,688
They got no business hanging around by
a saloon. I want you to get them out of there.

928
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:56,522
- But I don't know if I can or not.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

929
01:16:56,821 --> 01:17:01,657
When I asked for somebody to handle this,
Miss Harris said you're the smartest kid here.

930
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:05,410
- That's why I've sent for you.
- I'll try.

931
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:11,826
Don't try. You do it. You get them boys out of
there the way Mark Strett would. tJnderstand?

932
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:13,915
- Yes, sir.
- That's a good boy.

933
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:16,330
Guess we picked out the right fella.

934
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:22,711
He's all right.
You got a good boy, Mrs Walsh.

935
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:25,346
Take a look outside, Molly.

936
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:33,851
Get ready.

937
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,107
All clear.

938
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,314
Goodbye, ma'am.

939
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,113
You take good care of yourself.

940
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,320
Goodbye.

941
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:46,822
Goodbye, son.

942
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:49,488
Goodbye. I hope I see you again sometime.

943
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,827
- What about next year?
- Will you really?

944
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:55,460
You be watching for me, a year from today.

945
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,213
- Sorry, Jimmie.
- Sorry?

946
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:07,096
A year ain't nothing.
I can hide out that long. Look out for her.

947
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:10,509
- You bet.
- I'm much obliged to you, Mark.

948
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:16,352
That's all right, partner.
Looks like you're gonna make it after all.

949
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,196
Here he comes.

950
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:26,824
- I got Charlie out to head them off.
- Keep an eye on the kid for me.

951
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,406
- I'll watch him.
- I'll see you a year from now.

952
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,869
What you fellas doing up there?

953
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:35,784
Drop them guns. Drop them!

954
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:38,495
Is that you, Charlie?

955
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:42,040
Come on down here.

956
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,420
These the fellas you meant?

957
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:50,515
Come on out, you fellas.

958
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,808
These them?

959
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,063
Yeah. That's two of them.

960
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:03,236
I told you you was wasting your time.
Much obliged, Charlie.

961
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:06,193
If I was you, I'd hit Mark for a raise. So long.

962
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,701
How about it, Ringo?

963
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,907
Get his foot out of the stirrup.

964
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:19,203
I ought to give you this
square in the belly, both barrels.

965
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:26,631
- Hunt Bromley got Ringo.
- Hunt Bromley got Ringo.

966
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:29,216
- No! No, Jimmie.
- Please, Ma.

967
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,848
Hear that? Hunt Bromley shot Ringo.

968
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:35,556
Please, Ma, please!
We gotta go back, please!

969
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:38,972
No, Jimmie, no. Come on.
We've got to go home.

970
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,976
Come on, get away. Don't gawk at him.

971
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:46,943
We got the doctor coming.
Just lay still and you'll be all right.

972
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:53,195
That boy... Hunt.

973
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:57,912
- We got him. He ain't getting away with it.
- No.

974
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,203
I drew first. I was ahead of him.

975
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:04,623
I seen it. You don't have to say that.
I seen who drew first.

976
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:08,134
You heard what I said, Mark. I drew first.

977
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:12,548
Now don't argue with me.
I know what I'm doing.

978
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,967
You don't have to do me no favours, pappy.

979
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:17,101
Keep your mouth shut.

980
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,893
If I was doing you a favour...

981
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:27,529
I'd let them hang you right now
and get it all over with.

982
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:32,363
But I don't want you to get off that light.

983
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:38,331
I want you to go on being a big, tough gunny.

984
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:45,460
I want you to... see what it means

985
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:50,799
to have to live like a big, tough gunny.

986
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:55,432
So don't thank me yet, partner.

987
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:03,231
You'll see what I mean.

988
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,690
Just...

989
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:15,652
wait.

990
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:44,188
Now, you look h...

991
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:48,227
- Don't say anything, Hunt. Don't talk to me.
- You can't...

992
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:53,570
Don't talk to me, I tell you.
Or I'll kill you if you do. You understand?

993
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:01,490
Now, listen to me, yellow-belly.

994
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:06,628
Ringo's fixed you good. You're gonna get it
exactly like you gave it to him.

995
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:10,711
Because there's a thousand
cheap squirts like you waiting right now

996
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:13,843
for the chance to kill
the man that killed Jimmie Ringo.

997
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:20,135
But it ain't gonna be here, sonny.
Not in my territory. So get going now.

998
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:24,430
Get killed somewhere else.

999
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:35,611
And that's just the beginning, tough boy.

1000
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:55,302
I'm awful sorry but there ain't no more room.
Ain't another seat left in the place.

1001
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:57,929
- Is Mark inside?
- Yes, ma'am. He's inside.

1002
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:02,183
Would you tell him
Mrs Ringo would like to see him?

1003
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:05,141
- Mrs Jimmie Ringo?
- Mrs Jimmie Ringo.

1004
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:07,476
And his boy.

1005
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:09,686
Yes, ma'am, Mrs Ringo.

1006
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,332
Come on in, Peggy.
