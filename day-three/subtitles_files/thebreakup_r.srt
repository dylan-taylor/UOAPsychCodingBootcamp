Are you gonna be like this all day?

I don't know. Is it gonna

I'm sitting next to a guy who's sitting

10
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,902
like he's at home on the toilet
with his legs spread.

11
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,529
Please don't crowd people.
Relax, please. Look at me.

12
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,947
- I am relaxed.
- Look how I'm sitting.

13
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,199
- Why are you sitting like that?
- Because... What do you think?

00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:15,409
Why'd you wake me up for this shit?

15
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,244
Because I'm trying to relax
and have a nice day.

Pass that on down there.

Hey, hot dog guy,
can I get six hot dogs down here, please?

00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,468
- Right away.
- GARY: And make it right, please.

22
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,721
You know, with the mustard
and the ketchup and the relish.

23
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,222
Don't make me hit you up for more.

24
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,099
I thought we were going
to Wiener Circle after this.

25

- We will.
- Then why are you getting hot dogs?

Pass this down, please.
You can keep the change.

You can have a hot... You want a hot dog?

Would you mind passing the lady
one of the hot dogs?

- Okay, give me a hot dog.

big guy can't eat all of them. Have one.

- Have you ever had one before?
- A hot dog?

- At the ballpark?
- I have. I believe I have.

00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,045

- Thank you.

- No, I'm okay.

It's a good dog. I like the hot dog.
I know.

That's nice.

49

You have a problem
with me eating a hot dog, guy?

50
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,239
I'm trying to watch the game
and have a hot dog.

51
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,575
- I'll smack him in his head.
- No, just leave him alone.

52
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,011
- Hey, you want to go get a drink?
- No.

53
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,888
I'm with somebody, sorry.

54
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,224
Who? The guy with the tucked-in shirt
and the visor?

55
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,102
What, is that like a brother?
The guy was not your brother, then.

56
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,353
- Who is this guy?
- He's not my brother.

57
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,438
Who's this... I'm getting mad now.
I'm jealous. Who is this guy?

58
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,981
- Who are you?
- I don't know. I'm kidding with you.

59
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,859
Who's the guy with the tucked-in stuff?
Is that a boyfriend?

60
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,612
- I'm going.
- Do you think you'll marry him?

61
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,572
- What?
- 'Cause I know you've thought about it.

62
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,158
The first time you laid eyes on him,
you probably thought,

63
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,704
"I wonder if I could marry this guy in plaid
shorts who tucks his shirt in. No way."

64
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,372
Then when you kissed him,
you said, "I can't believe it."

65
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,125
"I had a lot to drink tonight.
I'm kissing the tucked-in guy."

66
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,293
- My point is, if you're not gonna marry him...
- Yeah.

67
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,795
...and if it's not forever,

68
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,631
then you really don't have anything
to lose in taking me up on my offer.

69
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,384
- Uh-huh. Well, I'm gonna go.
- Okay. Me, too.

70
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,428
- Okay.
- To where? On an ice-breaking first date?

71
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,221
- Well, no, I don't think...
- Listen.

while you're with

then you can do that.

74
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,102

75
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,688
a get-out-of-bored-love-for-free card
with no strings attached.

76
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,189
- God, you're crazy.
- No, I'm not crazy.

77
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,066
And a lot of times people go,
"Oh, that's crazy,"

78
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,484
and then they go, "It's genius."

79
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,236
That's what happened
when the person invented fire.

80
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,406
They burned that witch. And guess what,
then they got warm and they ate good stuff.

81
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,283
Now, where are we headed to?
Let's not make this weird,

82
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,742
- 'cause I'm not good on dates.
- No. You know what?

83
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,703
I'm better just to kind of hang out
and, if we don't have fun,

84
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,745
- I might go my separate way.
- Okay.

85
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,498
I'm not committing to anything.
I'll go hang out with you for a little bit.

86
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,417
- That's not gonna happen.
- But I can't say for sure.

142
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,828
or how to go about buying it.
I mean, like that painting.

something that I could have done myself.

Yeah. I completely agree with you.

145
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,632
You know, an art teacher of mine once said,

146
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,219
"Never buy a piece of art
that you don't have to have."

147
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,723
You know, don't worry about
who the artist is or how much it's worth.

148
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,727
I mean, you have to live with it every day.
You have to walk by it every day.

You know, you have to really love it.
You have to really appreciate it.

Hey, honey, you've got to really...
You should get ready, okay?

159

- Oh, you look great.
- Thank you.

160
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,300
Got a lot of nice stuff. Got a pizza.

00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,315
- Gary?
- Yeah?

166
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:12,320
- Oh, come on! Really?
- You got three lemons.

What my baby wants, my baby gets.
You know that.

168
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,367
Yeah, but I wanted 12. Baby wanted 12.

169
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,703
Why would you want 12 lemons?

170
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,581
Because I'm making a 12-lemon centerpiece.

171
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,668
So, no one's actually even eating them?
They're just show lemons?

00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,213
Yeah. They're just show lemons.
Shown in the center of the table.

I'm glad you find that amusing,

174
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,716
but I cannot fill a vase
with only three lemons.

175
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,261
Well, can't you just use, like,
maybe a drinking glass?

176
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,428
I'm not gonna use a drinking...

177
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,139
We could have a smaller version
of a centerpiece.

178
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,266
I'm not gonna use a drinking glass
for our centerpiece.

179
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,392
You know what? I've got an idea.

180
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,645
Why don't we go ahead and scratch
the centerpiece idea altogether,

181
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,605
because the chicken that burnt my mouth

182
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,566
could maybe use a little bit of lemon
on top of it.

You've done such a great job already.
Don't you want to finish it yourself

194
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,430
and have that personal power
of that accomplishment?

195
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,348
- Set the table.
- Listen to me.

196
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,643
Do you think that when Michelangelo, right,

197
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,271
was painting the Sixteenth Chapel,
that he said,

198
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,065
"Hey, guys, you know,
I did pretty good on the first 15 chapels,

199
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,276
"but why don't you help me
design this one?

200
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,403
"And maybe you could help me...
Give me a brush

"and you guys can grab brushes,
and we can all make a great chapel." Uh-uh.

202
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,868
No, he didn't.
And you wanna know what the results were?

203
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,369
A masterpiece.

204
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:49,167
Okay. It's the Sistine Chapel,
not the Sixteenth,

205
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,838
and I bet when Michelangelo asked for 12
brushes, they didn't bring him three.

206
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,466
Yeah. Okay, all the talking
is really starting to drain me,

207
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,719
and now I'm gonna have to watch the
highlights later to see what I missed here.

208
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,137
- Honey, look, Gary, just...
- Down time's important.

209
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,181
- Gary, please just take a shower, okay?
- Down time's important.

I don't want to have happen.

that I sent to you to good use.

might be a little more amazing

if we had a pool table.

240
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,048
Gary, we've already discussed that.

241
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,884
We're gonna get a pool table
when we get a bigger place.

242
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,137
The place is plenty big now,
if you wanted a pool table because...

243
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,097
- Gary.
- Yeah. You could take the dining room table,

244

in the living room? Okay.

How do you... I mean, what do you do
with a dining room table?

248

- Eat on ft.
- We'd have no furniture in the living...

249
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,109
- Where's the furniture go?
- All I'm saying is,

250
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,652
it would be nice
to be able to shoot some pool.

251
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,821
- Well, this isn't a dorm.
- Look, baby, I completely understand.

252
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,364
There's halls and stuff.
I mean, you can go...

253
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,075
We will wait and get a pool table
when we have a bigger place.

Norma Lee, who?

00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,429
Normally, I don't go around
knocking on doors,

262
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,806

- LUPUS: I got a joke. I got a joke.

264

How's it going? I got a joke for you.

265
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:16,355

a gay Eskimo and a black guy?

266

with the jokes for tonight.

267

Let's just talk with each other.

I saw that Three Brothers article
in the <i>Trib </i>this week.

270
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,868
Sounds like you guys
are up to some pretty exciting stuff.

271
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:33,873
Basically, our big goal is to try to take
Chicago tourism by air, land and sea.

272
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,418
We're still in the ground phase
with the buses.

273
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,551
But as soon as we get
our infantry established,

274
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:49,013
- then we'll take it to the squids.
- GARY: Yeah.

275
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,643
- Boats. Boats.
- Oh, boats.

276
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,854
As soon as we control the waterway,
then we'll bring in air supports

277
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,816
and then
we'll pretty much control everything.

278
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,819
You know, Dennis,

279
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,697
the way your face lights up
when you describe your ambitions,

280
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,658
it's really inspiring.

281
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,745
- Oh, thanks.
- Because I understand

282
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,665
how you feel that passion.

283
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,377
RICHARD: And sharing it with other people,
I think that's what life's about.

284
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,713
I don't feel that about
boats and squibs... Squids?

285
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:23,923
- ALL: Squids.
- Sorry.

286
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,427
- CAROL: Yeah.
- But I do feel it about singing.

287
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,350
With my <i>a cappella </i>group,
The Tone Rangers.

288
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,730
Although it's not as aggressive
as your dream,

289
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:43,818
it's really more of a brotherhood.
It's like a musical team.

290
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,780
It's like a symphony of guys.
Guy symphony.

291
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,534
And it's very hard to
describe the true magic

292
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,830
of a group of guys
singing in perfect harmony.

293
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,999
It's transcendent.

294
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,418
But it's still very real.

295
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,506
I guess the best way
to put it in words is just...

296
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,675
(SINGING SINGLE NOTE)

297
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,982
Even that doesn't do it.

298
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,277
That doesn't do it
because that's just one person.

299
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,572
And what I'm talking about is
the pulse of the collective.

I'd rather be just a listener and enjoy
all the banging that he's doing and the...

You know, Gary, that's your prerogative.
That's your right, to listen.

Meantime, I've gotta talk to Brooke
about something.

some flowers."

loves the ballet

But it's just not what I want.
I don't want to break up with him.

478
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,644
I don't. I just want him to say thank you.
I want him to want to do the dishes.

479
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,439
I just want him to want
to take me to the ballet.

I want him to get me 12 lemons! You know...

481

I just want him to care enough about
this relationship to want to work on it.

482
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,743
Okay, you know what?
I'm putting on my shoes

483
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,328
- and I'm gonna be there in 15 minutes.
- No, Ad. Don't.

Please, I really don't want to see anybody.
I really don't.

486
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,543
And I can hear you in there
banging around your dishes.

487
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,421
And I don't want you getting out
your Clorox and your rubber gloves,

488
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,466
- and taking this out on the kitchen.
- Look, look, look.

489
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:56,055
Okay. Tonight just...
It just got a little out of hand,

490
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:01,310
and hopefully he's just gonna realize

491
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,813
that he's got some changes to make
and he's gonna...

492
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,693
He's gonna come home and apologize.

493
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,822

- I'm done with the relationship.
- JOHNNY O: Whatever.

497
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,873
So, it's just kind of,
"You're done with the relationship?"

498
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,374
Well, you're obviously hurt about it.

499

- She got to you. You're hurt.
- I'm not.

500

It's nothing to be ashamed of.
She hurt you.

I'm a little shocked.
I'm a little surprised.

503
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,050
Gary, you're devastated. Now, what's
the name of the guy she's doing?

504
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,843
I'm gonna solve your problem.
What's his name?

505
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,054
- What are you talking about?
- Have you checked her e-mail?

506
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,180
I don't check e-mails. I don't...

507
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,932
You can get a program
that records keystrokes.

508
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,518
It costs, like, 20 bucks.
Very easy to use. Okay?

509
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,063
You get a password, you check her e-mail.
You find out everything about her.

510
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,439
That's how I found out
about the Puerto Rican

511
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,107
- that Stacy was running around with.
- Okay.

512
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,151
You are reading a little too much
into this situation.

513
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,903
There is no one
she's running around with, okay?

514
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,321
We had a fight over
the groceries I brought home.

515
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,448
You're probably right.
She's probably not sleeping with anybody.

516
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:57,866
- No. Not what it's about.
- Okay.

517
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,451
- Maybe she's with another guy, maybe not.
- She's not.

518

I don't know. I'm not Columbo. Okay?

519
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,624
But what we do know is that
she doesn't want to be with you anymore.

520
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,839
I mean, I hate to be shitty about it,
and so cut and dry, but let's face it.

521
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,967
She says she doesn't want to be with you,
and I believe her.

522
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,094
Now, we gotta figure it out.
And you're gonna need a place to go

you get your head right over this thing.

who gets to keep the goddamn place.

- 'Cause she's gonna put...

537

She's gonna move out of the place, Johnny.

538

I've come to play on the team.

636
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,779
Look, Gary, I just don't think
it's a good idea

637
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,616
for you and I to be around each other
any more than we have to right now.

638
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,826
I completely agree.
Maybe you should go play some pinball.

639
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,954
- No, I think you should leave.
- Okay.

640
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:29,210
Brooke, when a man makes a commitment
to a team, he honors that commitment.

641
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,923
He doesn't let emotions or personal issues
get in the way of victory.

642
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,426
And I've made a commitment to this team.

643
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:40,138
- They don't want you here either, Gary.
- Yeah. Sure, they don't.

644
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,973
They don't. They're my friends.

645
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,727
- But you're not a strong bowler.
- That's not the point.

646
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,189
You know what?
Let's just... Why don't we let them decide?

647
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,901
Gary, don't. No. Don't involve them, okay?
That's unnecessary.

648
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,736
- What's wrong, Castro?
- Castro?

649
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,571
Well, Castro doesn't let people
vote as a team.

650
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,782
- Okay. Ask them.
- Thank you.

651
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,534
Okay, everyone. Team vote here.

652
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:05,080
By a show of hands, just put it up
when you make a decision,

653
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:09,125
who here agrees with Brooke
and thinks I should leave the bowling team?

654
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:12,879
Shocker.

655
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,317
<i>Band of Brothers.
</i>You should rent it sometime.

656
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:40,698
Good luck, everyone.
Riding Miss Gutter Ball to the finals.

657
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,161
- ANDREW: Hey, Gary.
- Yeah.

658
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,041
- I'm gonna need your shirt back.
- What?

659
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,878
Well, we're gonna have to replace you,
and you know we get docked 10 pins

660
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,756
if everyone's not in matching
Pin Shakers uniforms.

661
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,801
- My shirt says "Gary" on it.
- Granted.

662
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,179
But actually, we know a guy named Gary.

663
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:07,559
And he's not as tall as you,
but he's a pretty good bowler.

664
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:20,029
I'm gonna have to request
that I have my wrist guard back then.

665
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,450
I'm sorry. That's mine.

666
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,748
Just give me the goddamn
wrist guard, please. Thank you.

667
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,834
I hope your wrist snaps.

668
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,009
Wow. Okay? You see that?
You know what I mean?

669
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,635
Yeah. That was awesome.

670
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,388
You just had your ex-boyfriend,
who you wish you were still dating,

671
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,515
voted off the bowling team.

672
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,851
Well, I had to do that
to get him right where I want him.

673
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:54,189
- Where's that? Shirtless in the parking lot?
- Addie, you're not getting this.

674
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,817
Gary loves this bowling team.
He's hurt right now.

675
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,527
He's feeling pretty bad.

676
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,280
He's gonna go out there
and he's gonna get drunk.

677
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,949
He's gonna make a complete fool of himself.

678
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,494
And he will be sitting there
feeling pretty lonely

679
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,872
and pretty pathetic,
and then it's just gonna hit him.

680
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,500
What's gonna hit him?

681
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,293
That not only is he out a girlfriend,

682
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,838
but his life is just falling apart
piece by piece

683
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,798
and maybe that life was pretty great.

684
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,635
And maybe I was the glue
that was holding it all together.

685
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:28,097
And if he wants that life back,
he's gonna have no choice but to change.

686
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,725
(MUSIC PLAYING)

687
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,228
- How about this, huh?
- I feel like we just found hell.

688
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,313
When did you start
coming to knobby joints like this?

689
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,440
I might be the greatest
you've ever seen, pal.

690
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,943
I'm conquering new frontiers. Hello, babe.

691
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,487
Yeah, you've got to put up
with the bad music and the $15 drinks,

692
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,698
but this place is stacked
with top-shelf, young, dumb ass.

693
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,076
All you gotta do is just
separate the weaker ones from the herd.

694
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,327
Come on, I'll get you into the VIP.

695
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,162
- Can I get a couple drinks from you?
- Okay, L.G.

696
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,373
Lupus, I got to be totally...
I got to be honest with you.

697
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,624
I'm not feeling it here.

698
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,084
You're gonna like it in here.
You're gonna love it.

699
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,253
- I don't like it out here.
- Look, listen to me, will you, please?

700
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,462
LUPUS: How you doing, Buzz?

701
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,714
While you were on the inside locked up
for the past two years,

702
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,091
the game has changed.

703
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,343
(WOMEN CHEERING)

704
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,597
Do you remember
when you were an outdoor cat

705
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,267
and you used to have to hunt
and kill for your food?

706
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,768
Well, you've become an indoor cat.

707
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,395
You've been getting your milk
brought to you

708
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,231
in a silver bowl, and guess what?
Now, you've been tossed back outside

709
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,526
and the alley has changed.
For example, your MTV generation,

710
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,529
your technology, your text message,
your TiVo. You name it.

711
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,781
People want their information faster.

712
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,868
People e-mail each other because
they want to exchange information, Gar.

713
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,537
They don't want to connect,
they want results.

714
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,290
- Okay.
- You gotta get to the message quicker.

715
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,375
Now, I want you to watch.
It's real simple. Okay?

716
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,838
How you doing, ladies?

717
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:45,466
Now, here's what I'd like to do to you.
First, I'd like to get you naked.

718
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,176
And then I'm gonna take some Saran Wrap

719
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,970
and I'm gonna wrap you up in it,
head to toe.

720
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,138
Then I'm gonna cut out two holes.

721
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,056
One for your mouth,
so you can breathe, obviously.

722
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,266
- And the other one...
- Asshole.

723
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,018
It could be a gorgeous
evening for us, babe.

724
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,352
The pink is gorgeous. Jesus, God.

725
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,354
Come here. Lupus, listen to me.
I want you to listen to me.

726
00:39:58,438 --> 00:39:59,731
There are our drinks. You want your drink?

727
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,900
No, I'm fine.
Thank you. The L.G. thanks you.

728
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:05,028
Will you listen to me, please?
You're my brother and I love you very much,

729
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,572
and maybe you do get laid tonight,
but maybe you get arrested.

730
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,782
Arrested for what, babe? Being awesome?

731
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:13,494
Come on, babe, listen. You want to
tell your jokes, tell your jokes.

732
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:17,206
But sooner or later you're gonna get hungry
and you're gonna wanna eat.

733
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,169
And jokes might make you feel better,
but they don't get you fed.

734
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,589
I'm gonna go take a lap.

735
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,927
(DOOR OPENING)

736
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,889
(DOOR SHUTTING)

737
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,811
- What are you doing?
- I'm sketching.

738
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,189
And where are you sketching?

739
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,733
- In the living room.
- No, in my bedroom.

740
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,401
And I didn't say anything to you, Brooke,

741
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,779
when you so arrogantly claimed the bed
without asking me,

742
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,199
but you can't just waltz into my room
and turn it into a damn art fair.

743
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,618
Gary, I've only taken up
a little bit of space, so...

744
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,620
I don't care if you only took an inch.

745
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:59,207
There might not be a door here,
but this is my domain. Okay?

746
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,626
I don't go into your bedroom
and set up a goddamn sawhorse.

747
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,379
Well, then what the hell is that pool table
doing in the dining room?

748
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,881
Because that's a common area.
And that's where this belongs.

749
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,466
- Not in my room.
- Hey, what are you doing?

750
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,218
- It belongs in another common area.
- Gary.

751
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,762
People want to come home
and they want to relax in their room.

752
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,598
Gary, it is 2:00 in the morning!

753
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,226
- Don't you drop my things.
- I don't know what to tell you, kid.

754
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,479
This is how I am when I'm single.
My hours start to get pretty strange.

755
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,481
Might be time for you
to think about moving out.

756
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,566
Why would I... No, I'm not moving anywhere.

757
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,694
Gary, just please turn the volume down.

758
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,988
Yeah, but I don't tell you
what the hell to do in your room.

759
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,572
You can doodle. You can dance.

760
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,032
You can bake
a goddamn gingerbread house.

761
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,158
I don't give a shit.

762
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,995
But in my room, I want to relax
and watch my highlights

763
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,664
in complete surround-sound experience.

764
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,167
- What the hell are you doing?
- You're not even gonna watch it!

765
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,504
- Don't tell me what I am or aren't not doing.
- Oh, what you are not, not doing?

766
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,840
- Go learn some English.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

767
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,427
I didn't have a grandfather
on the board of some fancy college.

768
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,221
Keyword being "was."
Did he touch the Filipino exchange student?

769
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,556
Did he not touch the exchange student?

770
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,182
- I don't know, Brooke. I wasn't there.
- Okay.

771
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,559
No, don't start with the family stuff.

772
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,686
Like your family's so perfect?
Your brother's a pervert!

773
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,147
Don't talk to me about
the sexual habits of family members.

774
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,690
What about your sister?

775
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:10,028
- My sister's been through a lot.
- Of dick.

776
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,614
There are some problems, Gary,
but can we please just leave it...

777
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:17,785
Problems? She slept with the entire
Arizona Cardinals offensive line.

778
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,538
That's not problems.
That's she's the problem!

779
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,583
- She was on vacation!
- She was on vacation.

780
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,502
Don't even get me started, by the way,
on your brother.

781
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,005
If I have to hear that guy sing
just one more time,

782
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,215
I'd hang myself with wax dental floss.

783
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:34,052
Could the guy
just come out of the closet, please?

784
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,471
Richard is not gay.

785
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,226
Okay, lassie, I want you to listen to me
and listen good.

786
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,897
I'm not saying he won't get married.
I'm not saying he won't even have kids.

787
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,231
But then one day his wife will come home,

788
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,400
and then she'll find him
with a guy named Majulio,

789
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,153
wearing leather helmets and clubbing
each other to Yanni's greatest hits.

790
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,821
Yeah. Right. Whatever. You're an infant.

791
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,406
Yeah, I'm an infant.

792
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,909
Go enjoy your room, Brooke,
'cause I'm gonna enjoy mine!

793
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,202
- Okay.

fool you with trickery

know that you're even in a fight.

00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,478
- I shouldn't sit here and pick on your art.
- No.

953
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,647
Because you got
the nuts part down, Picasso.

954
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,315
GARY: All you have to do
is cut off your frigging ear.

955
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,524
BROOKE: That's Van Gogh, you idiot!

956
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,360
And your insults are much more effective
when they're accurate.

957
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,736
GARY: Don't talk to me
about being goddamn accurate!

958
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,196
BROOKE: I can talk to you
about anything that I want.

959
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,280
'Cause you couldn't even draw a sock.

960
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,448
You don't do anything right!
You're a lazy...

961
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:34,931
Everyone said, "Shoe, shoe, shoe!"

962
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:35,574
Everyone said, "Shoe, shoe, shoe!"

963
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:40,371
At first, I figured that the split
was just something temporary,

964
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,541
something that you two would work out
and get past,

965
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,209
but after tonight I think it's pretty clear

966
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,128
that you two genuinely
do not want to get back together.

967
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,297
- There's not a shot in hell.
- Gary.

968
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,049
- GARY: I'm just...
- I got you.

969
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:55,386
As your friend and as your realtor,

970
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,595
I'm not gonna leave here tonight

971
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:58,305
until we decide
what to do about this condo,

972
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:02,726
because this living situation
is obviously not working out.

973
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,147
Gary?

974
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,154
Well, the only logical thing
that I can think of

975
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,700
is for her to move out of the condo,

976
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:21,537
and then to pay me some
sort of a penalty as compensation for

977
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,831
- the labor that I did all around the condo.
- What? What?

978
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,001
What? Pay you compensation
for your labor?

979
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,170
- We fixed this place up together.
- Are you nuts?

980
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:31,922
- Stop calling me nuts, I swear to God.
- I fixed the...

981
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,007
You went around with a sponge,

982
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,550
and you went in the bathroom
and you dotted foofy shit.

983
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,385
- That's what you're saying that I did?
- GARY: There's no...

984
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,928
BROOKE: That was...
That's called aesthetics.

985
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:42,308
It warmed this place up so it didn't look
like an army barracks, which it was about to.

986
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,310
I'll tell you what it's called
in his language, depreciated.

987
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:46,395
- That's what it's called.
- You don't even know what that means.

988
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,814
Unless the next buyer happens to have
your same Zulu-voodoo-land taste.

989
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,190
- All right.
- Let me tell you something else.

990
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,651
It's gonna cost money
to cover up the holes in the wall.

991
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:56,113
The holes that you drilled in the wall there
to hang up whatever that thing is called.

992
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,281
Oh, please. Gary.

993
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,532
GARY: You're gonna have to
cost money to fix that.

994
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,951
What I did, Brooke,
has concrete value to the condo.

995
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:02,870
I added concrete...
Well, let's just go on record.

996
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,789
We're dealing with facts here.
I did the tiling in the bathroom.

997
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,458
- Have you seen...
- I did the new track lighting.

998
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,501
- That tile is the shittiest tile job.
- GARY: I did the plumbing!

999
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:10,961
- The plumbing!
- That's realty terms.

1000
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,796
Okay. Let's talk about your plumbing.
This is his plumbing.

1001
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,048
We have two temperatures in our bathroom.

1002
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,842
We get either scalding hot
or we get frostbite.

1003
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,427
- That's it. That's all we get.
- It's my problem

1004
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,845
that she doesn't know how
to pace a shower?

1005
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:20,929
GARY: Now all of a sudden that's my fault.

1006
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,056
I get one minute to take a shower.

1007
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,349
- One minute?
- BROOKE: One minute of warmth?

1008
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,559
- Oh, Jesus. One minute.
- That's it. That's correct.

1009
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,354
Thank God you're not in charge of keeping
all the clocks in Chicago on time.

1010
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,898
- This is basic logic.
- You are out of your mind. You have lost it.

1011
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,775
Let me explain this to you
in plain chapter and verse.

1012
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:36,904
Cheese and rice, you guys are
gonna kill each other. Now, let's just...

1013
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,490
Realistically speaking, neither one of you

1014
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,700
can afford this mortgage
on your own, okay?

1015
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:45,412
And that's a shame, because this building
will continue to increase in value.

1016
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,748
I get nothing
but phone calls about it, all right?

1017
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,416
Waiting for a unit to open up.

1018
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,170
So, as your realtor,
the last thing I would suggest is selling.

1019
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,799
But as your friend,
I just, I don't see any other solution.

1020
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,009
You take your halves,
you go your separate ways,

1021
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,095
and you get on with your lives.

1022
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:07,601
I know that selling is not the easiest
thing, but I do think that it's the best.

1023
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,772
And to be honest, this is a situation

1024
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,109
where I would just as soon
not take a commission.

1025
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:21,865
- That's great. Thank you.
- That's great. Thank you for that.

1026
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,701
I wish I didn't have to, you know,

1027
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,662
but company policy says
I cannot waive that.

1028
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,581
But I was just...
You know, I'm saying in theory, you know.

1029
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:34,044
In this situation, 'cause we're friends,
I wish I could waive it.

1030
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,546
No can do, though.

1031
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,883
As soon as you can, I would love to get
a set of keys from you guys.

1032
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,845
You just drop them off.
Okay. Great. There they are.

1033
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,055
I'll be bringing by people all week.

1034
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:49,184
You won't even know I'm here.
The good news is, should move quickly.

1035
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,811
All right.

1036
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,939
Okay to leave you two alone now?

1037
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,651
Got to get back to Jen.
Very excited about the win tonight.

1038
00:53:58,819 --> 00:53:59,987

- Yes. But I...
- Well, today's not that day,

I can't afford to look weak.

and you have yet to fire me.

to find and train somebody new,

1065

it's gonna cost you time,
and it's gonna cost you money,

to spend either one of those.

in hopes that losing me
would make him want to change,

1076
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,788
and that's, you know...

1077

00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:57,242
So, how do you and Brooke
know each other?

1112
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:00,495
Well, how don't we know each other,
you know what I mean?

1113
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:05,208
- BROOKE: Hi, Paul.
- Oh, hey. Wow, you look great.

1114
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,251
Thank you.

1115
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:09,755
- BROOKE: Are you ready to go?
- Yeah. All set.

1116
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,967
- So, it was great meeting you.
- Apple martinis.

1117
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,094
- All right, come on.
- That normally does the trick.

1118
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:18,430
- Just ignore him.
- But just two. Three, she'll get sloppy.

1119
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,723
You'll become a babysitter.

1120
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,893
Oh, and fantasy role playing.
She's got a real thing for lifeguards.

1121
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:26,062
Put some zinc oxide on your nose
and she'll lose her mind.

1122
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,314
It'll all be over with.

MAN: <i>Y'all want me to stop running?</i>

1125
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,519
I mean, the most challenging part
of what I do

1126
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,688
is between February and April 15th.

1127
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:12,150
That's what we in the biz
like to call crunch time.

1128
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,945
That sounds fascinating.

1129
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,613
- Good evening.
- Hi.

1130
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,448
Can I start you two off
with something to drink?

1131
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:22,786
Yeah, you know, we're gonna start
with a couple of apple martinis, please.

1132
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:27,374
No, you know what? I'm gonna...
I'm just gonna start with a water.

1133
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,835
Well, you can just bring those,
just in case. What was I saying?

1134
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,127
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1135
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:34,214
So, you know,
it's not like it's all work and no play.

1136
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:37,968
You know, I mean, after April 15th,
that's what we in the biz

1137
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,720
like to call party time.

1138
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:42,764
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Excuse me.

1139
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,310
Oh, I have to get this. I'm so sorry.

1140
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:48,436
Hello.

1141
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,813
ADDIE: <i>Okay, is this when
I'm supposed to call?</i>

1142
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:50,939
What?

1143
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,483
What do you mean? What?
Where? What happened?

1144
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:57,112
<i>- Okay, that's great.
</i>-Wait. What? Oh, all right.

1145
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,489
Listen, where... Just don't move.
Where are you?

1146
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,575
<i>- I'm sitting in my kitchen.
</i>-Sitting? Okay.

1147
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,618
(STAMMERING) Don't move.

1148
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:07,622
Don't... I'm gonna be right there, honey.
I'm gonna be right there, okay?

1149
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:09,499
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, my gosh.

1150
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,001
That was my best friend.

1151
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,921
She just had an accident and she...
She has this knee thing

1152
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,966
- and she's just very fragile, and I have to go.
- What?

1153
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,510
- I can give you a ride.
- No. No. That's okay.

1154
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,305
I'm gonna grab a cab, so... I'm so sorry.

1155
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:24,931
I like your dress.

1156
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:29,686
I think he's fascinating.
He's obviously read a lot of books.

1157
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,396
Yeah. Yeah, I bet he has.

1158
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:34,774
He reads a lot of books
because nobody wants to talk to him.

1159
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:38,528
He's a friend of Andrew's
who's always been polite.

1160
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:41,031
It's the best I could do
on such short notice, okay?

1161
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,158
Well, you know what?
Polite is not gonna do it.

1162
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:47,245
We've got to find somebody
who is really gonna make Gary jealous.

1163
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,916
LUPUS: Can I just say something?
You sound a little jealous, Gary.

1164
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:52,876
GARY: Why would I be jealous
of some guy with computer skills?

1165
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:56,546
Let's say he doesn't have computer skills,
but he's got a big old elephant hog on him?

1166
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,340
Would that bother you
or would you be okay with that?

1167
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,799
Not nearly as much as the way
that your mind works.

1168
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,176
LUPUS: My mind works great.

1169
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,512
So, what's this bullshit I hear
about you selling the condo?

1170
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,681
Selling that condo is ludicrous.

1171
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,308
I was waiting for when I was gonna get

1172
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,977
the how-Gary-always-screws-his-life-up
speech again.

1173
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,687
- This must be the right time.
- Look, you tell me,

1174
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:14,814
- you just tell me, tell me.
- Is it happening now? Yeah. Okay.

1175
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,484
Tell me how losing that asset

1176
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,654
is gonna get us on the river?

1177
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:24,449
Go ahead, just tell me. Tell me.
Somebody tell me. What is this?

1178
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,911
- What is this? What is it? What is it? Hey!
- Don't patronize me.

1179
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,955
- Helicopters.
- Helicopters. Exactly!

1180
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,998
How does losing the asset
give us helicopters?

1181
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:35,794
Dennis, I'm being totally serious with you.
I don't need this shit right now.

1182
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,004
Hey, you want to cry, cry to Mom.

1183
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,674
Nobody's crying. I'm not crying.

1184
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:43,510
- I just don't feel like hearing it.
- There's no feelings here.

1185
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:47,305
This is about money and business.
Fine, you broke up.

1186
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,893
You broke up. Fine.

1187
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:54,980
You know, sad.

1188
01:02:56,189 --> 01:03:00,652
Sad is, instead of putting $1,000
into your mortgage every month,

1189
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,697
you waste it on rent. That's what sad is.

1190
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:08,618
Oh, you're broke up.
You're confused, brokenhearted.

1191
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,997
Heartbreak is not having that money

1192
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,792
as part of your net worth
and then not saving the money,

1193
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:18,920
so that after taxes you can invest!

1194
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:20,880
You know, you're

1195
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,259
confused.

1196
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:29,556
- Are you finished?
- Look, I need the damn tour logs.

1197
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,642
Yeah.

1198
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:36,021
Well, I really, really appreciate
the heart to heart.

1199
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:38,481
It was a great talk, Dennis. Thank you.

1200
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,693
Oh, well, you're behind three months.
You're still behind three months.

1201
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,863
And those logs are imperative
to insuring that our books are straight!

1202
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,574
I'll tell you what those logs are.
Those logs are bullshit is what they are!

1203
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,534
You got the receipts.
Tally the goddamn things yourself!

1204
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:50,744
I do, I do!

1205
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:54,247
And I don't appreciate it, because
it cuts into my time with my family.

1206
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,292
I could be spending that time with
my family instead of doing your books.

1207
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,544
I already do the taxes. I do the billing.

1208
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:02,839
I do the hiring, the firing.
I do the maintenance.

1209
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,967
Come on, what do you do?
What is it that you do?

1210
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:08,845
- You do the tours!
- I am the talent, Dennis!

1211
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,765
They sign up a month in advance to see me.

1212
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:16,227
They'll wait in line
for the next bus to see me! All right?

1213
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:22,108
So don't drain me with all this bullshit
about the goddamn tour logs!

Yeah, sure. Of course. Great.

I play the game and it's like,
four hours go by.

- No, that's fine. Please.

1596
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:51,423
- So, what do you think?
- I think you're right.

1597
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:53,842
- I think it's great.
- Good.

1599
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:57,345
BROOKE: So,

1600
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:02,183
I will have that wrapped up.

1601
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:04,978
Packed up, sorry, and delivered.

1602
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:07,772
Thank you for taking the time
to show it to me, okay?

1603
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:08,982
Sure.

1604
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,693
- Yeah. I'm gonna run.
- Okay, I'll walk you out.

1605

GARY: So, the thing that I was most afraid
of happening happened

1609
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:35,800
and I don't regret it at all,
because now she knows how I feel.

1610
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:38,053
U'h-huh.

1611
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:40,847
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1612
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:45,143
I think, what you got to do now
is really think hard...

1613
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:48,313
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...because you have to find somebody

1614
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:51,816
that can't be traced back to either of us

1615
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:54,819
to visit this guy.

1616
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:57,363
What are you talking about? I don't...

1617
01:32:57,447 --> 01:32:59,157
The guy who came with her.

1618
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,659
I don't need anything to happen to the guy.

1619
01:33:01,743 --> 01:33:03,411
But if they could trace him back
to either one of us...

1620
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:05,580
- It's not about him. I don't care about that.
- ...it's a problem.

1621
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:08,249
- The guy, he's not a...
- They're not dumb. Cops are smart, trust me.

1622
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:10,251
- Okay, but he's not a problem to me.
- Right.

1623
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:12,128
Listen to me.

1624
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:15,632
Promise me
that you're not gonna do anything.

1625
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:16,841
I1 got you.

1626
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:19,844
It's better if nobody...
You don't know anything.

1627
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:21,429
- What are you talking about?
- I'll take care of it.

1628
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:23,473
I don't want you to take care of anything.
John, do me a favor.

1629
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:26,601
- I'm being serious with you.
- I know, I know. Smart. You're smart.

1630
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:27,977
No, I'm not. I'm being honest with you.

1631
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:29,437
- I don't want anything to happen to him.
- Me, either.

1632
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:31,606
Promise me you're not gonna have
anyone do anything to this guy.

1633
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:33,441
But you've gotta tell me exactly
what you're gonna tell them,

1634
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:35,527
if the cops come to you.
Because if we tell a different story...

1635
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,403
- Nothing. Promise me one thing.
- We don't care...

1636
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:39,447
John, I'm gonna go home.
I can't do this. I'm exhausted.

1637
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:41,866
Right, go home. Just make sure
your neighbors know you're going home.

1638
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:45,620
Do me a favor. They got phone records.
Make a couple phone calls tonight.

1639
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:47,455
Especially around 10:00.

1640
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:50,834
Please don't do anything. All right.

1641
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:52,585
I don't mean it like... I mean, honestly.

1642
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:54,045
No, no, I got it.

1643
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:00,885
For all you know, nothing's happening.

1644
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,680
- I don't want anything to happen.
- Right.

1645
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:05,139
Say it louder.

1646
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:36,230
What are you doing here so early?

1647
01:35:58,795 --> 01:35:59,837
Hey.

1648
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:06,260
- Everything okay with you and...
- Yeah, everything's gonna be great.

1649
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:10,848
I just wanna get my day started,
but I just wanted to say that

1650
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:14,394
I'm sorry it took so long for me to...

1651
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:17,522
I love you, Dennis.

1652
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:21,734
- It's all right. It's okay.
- (DENNIS GASPING)

1653
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:26,239
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go do the stuff.

1654
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:54,892
So, that's it for all my stuff.

1655
01:36:57,979 --> 01:37:02,066
If you want, you could give me your key
and I'll drop it off at Riggleman's.

1656
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:03,818
All right.

1657
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:14,370
Thanks.

1658
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:16,539
Gary.

1659
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:20,918
You know, there's a thousand things I...

1660
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:23,921
I would have done differently.

1661
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,258
Me, too.

1662
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:33,765
Sort of, actually, when I see this space,
I realize that if we didn't have

1663
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:37,643
such a big coffee table
and that oversized couch

1664
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:43,483
a pool table would have fit nicely.

1665
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:44,776
Yeah.

1666
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:50,573
Although the oversized couch did come in
very useful the last couple of weeks, so...

1667
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:52,408
Yes, it... I guess.

1668
01:37:58,331 --> 01:37:59,707
Have a good trip.

1669
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:03,419
Thanks.

are kind of full with all the bags here.

- I've been really good.

- Yeah? Oh, yeah.

- You've lost some weight.
- Well, it's very deceiving, actually.

I've managed to become thin without
having any real muscle on me whatsoever.

I'm proud of myself.

- Thanks.

- It did. It went really well.

- Oh, good.
- It was fun. It was amazing.

1712

I saw so many amazing places.
It was just...

1713

But, you know,
you do realize how much you love home.

1714

- Yeah. It's good to be back.

- And the boat. Congratulations on the boat.
- Thanks.

and I'm gonna come by and take a ride.

It'll be on the house. Come on by.

01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:05,977
Definitely.

- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

I'm just saying we shouldn't wait
so long the next time before we...

- Yeah,
- ...catch up.

1727
