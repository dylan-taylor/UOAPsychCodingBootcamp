1
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,984
<i>Please verify that the P1 ATA removal...</i>

2
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,945
<i>...on replacement cap part 1 and 2
are complete.</i>

3
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,575
<i>DMA M 1, M2, M3 and M4 are complete.</i>

4
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,327
Okay. <i>Copy that,</i> Explorer.

5
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,746
<i>Dr. Stone, Houston.</i>

6
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,791
<i>Medical is concerned
about your ECG readings.</i>

7
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,710
I'm fine, Houston.

8
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,797
<i>Well, Medical doesn't agree,
doc. Are you feeling nauseous?</i>

9
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,676
<i>Not any more than usual, Houston.
Diagnostics are green.</i>

10
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,263
<i>Link to communications card
ready for data reception.</i>

11
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:41,059
<i>If this works, when we touch down tomorrow,
I'm buying all you guys a round of drinks.</i>

12
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,603
<i>That's a date, doctor.</i>

13
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,481
<i>Just remember,
Houston's partial to margaritas.</i>

14
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,901
<i>Booting comms card now.</i>

15
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,778
<i>Please confirm link.</i>

16
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,532
<i>That's a negative,
we're not seeing any data.</i>

17
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,535
<i>Stand by, Houston,
I'm gonna reboot the comms card.</i>

18
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,745
<i>Standing by.</i>

19
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,831
<i>Houston,
I have a bad feeling about this mission.</i>

20
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,583
<i>Please expand.</i>

21
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,627
<i>Okay, let me tell you a story.</i>

22
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,213
<i>It was '96. I'd been up here for 42 days.</i>

23
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,050
<i>Every time I passed over Texas,
I looked down...</i>

24
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,304
<i>...knowing that Mrs. Kowalski
was looking up, thinking of me.</i>

25
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,223
<i>Six weeks I'm blowing kisses at that woman.</i>

26
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,935
<i>Then we land at Edwards and I find out
that she's run off with this lawyer.</i>

27
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,063
<i>So I packed my car, and I headed to...</i>

28
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,982
<i>Tijuana. You've told this story, Kowalski.</i>

29
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:33,111
<i>As Houston recalls,
she, uh, took off in your '74 GTO.</i>

30
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,698
<i>Engineering requests fuel status
on the jet pack prototype.</i>

31
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,494
<i>Five hours off the reservation
and I show 30 percent drain.</i>

32
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,371
<i>Give my compliments to Engineering.</i>

33
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,207
<i>Except for a slight malfunction
in the nulling of the roll axis...</i>

34
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,250
<i>...this jet pack is one
prime piece of thrust.</i>

35
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,629
<i>Engineering says thank you.</i>

36
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,215
Tell them I still prefer
my '67 Corvette, though.

37
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,510
- Speaking of which, did I ever <i>tell</i> you...
- We know the Corvette story.

38
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,095
Even Engineering?

39
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,222
<i>Especially Engineering.</i>

40
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,933
<i>We're going to miss you, Matt.</i>

41
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,560
<i>Comms card reboot in progress.</i>

42
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:06,895
<i>Thank you, doctor.</i>

43
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,106
<i>Shariff, what's your status?</i>

44
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:13,360
<i>Nearly there.
Replacing battery module A 1 and C.</i>

45
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,780
<i>Could you be a little more specific?</i>

46
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,408
<i>Indeterminate estimates
make Houston anxious.</i>

47
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,327
<i>No, no, no, Houston. Don't be anxious.</i>

48
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,746
<i>Anxiety's not good for the heart.</i>

49
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,249
<i>System is ready to reactivate.</i>

50
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,627
<i>Hubble telescope engaged.
Upgrade fully functional.</i>

51
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,214
<i>That applause you hear is for you, Shariff.</i>

52
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,050
<i>Congratulations.
Kick back, take the rest of the day off.</i>

53
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,849
<i>Matt, do you have a visual...</i>

54
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,269
<i>...on just what Mission Specialist Sheriff
is doing up there?</i>

55
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,522
He appears to be doing
some form of the Macarena.

56
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,317
But that would be just a
best-guess scenario on my part.

57
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,194
<i>Dr. Stone, Houston.</i>

58
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,114
<i>Medical now have you
with</i> a <i>temperature drop to 35.</i> 9...

59
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,783
<i>...and a heart-rate rise to 70.</i>

60
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,327
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

61
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,912
<i>Houston, I'm fine.</i>

62
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,958
<i>It's just keeping your lunch down in zero-G
is harder than it looks.</i>

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,171
<i>Dr. Stone, Medical is asking
if you want to return to Explorer.</i>

64
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,841
Negative. We've been here a week,
Houston. Let's just finish this. Ahem.

65
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,509
Card is up.

66
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,595
<i>No, that's a negative.</i>

67
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,890
<i>I'm afraid we're getting nothing
on this end, doctor.</i>

68
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,392
Try again.

69
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,561
<i>No, still nothing.</i>

70
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,607
Houston, can you please
turn that music off?

71
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,317
<i>Kowalski.</i>

72
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,027
<i>Not a problem.</i>

73
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,779
Thank you, Kowalski.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,408
Now, Houston?

75
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,577
<i>That's a negative.</i>

76
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,413
Could Houston be misinterpreting the data?

77
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,124
<i>Well, we're not receiving any data.</i>

78
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,754
<i>Engineering is recommending
a vis-check for component damage.</i>

79
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,715
Let me see what's going on.

80
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,384
What have we got?

81
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,645
Visual examination doesn't reveal
any damaged components.

82
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,648
The problem must be originating
from the comms panel.

83
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,025
<i>Yeah, that seems to be the case.</i>

84
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,695
<i>Engineering admits that you warned us
that this could happen.</i>

85
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,824
<i>That's as close to an apology
as you're going to get from them.</i>

86
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,867
<i>We should have listened to you, doc.</i>

87
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,411
<i>Well, looks like
we're going to have to improvise.</i>

88
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,830
I'm on it.

89
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,415
<i>How long do you think it'll take you?</i>

90
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,417
One hour. Ahem.

91
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,836
<i>Outstanding.</i>

92
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,297
<i>Installing your system in the Hubble
is the purpose of this mission...</i>

93
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,716
<i>...and so we appreciate
your patience, doctor.</i>

94
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,803
<i>Kowalski, we know you don't care
about things like this...</i>

95
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,473
<i>...but, uh, for your information, this
delay is not going to be long enough...</i>

96
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,434
<i>...for you to break Anatoly Solovyev's
spacewalking record.</i>

97
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,771
<i>- It</i> seems <i>like you're gonna be left...
- Seventy-five minutes shy?</i>

98
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,815
<i>Never crossed my mind.</i>

99
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,525
Matt...

100
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,861
<i>...it's been a privilege.</i>

101
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,029
<i>Right back at you, Houston.</i>

102
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,365
<i>Enjoy your last walk.</i>

103
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,119
Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone
in removing the panel?

104
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,746
<i>- Assistance appreciated.
- Permission granted.</i>

105
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,040
Thank you, Houston. Agh.

106
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,542
Mind if I join the fun?

107
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,543
Certainly.

108
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,295
How you feeling?

109
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,340
Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble-dried.

110
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,927
Well, it's been a rough week.
If it makes you feel any better...

111
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:30,181
...I coughed up everything
but my kidneys on my first ride.

112
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,100
Shit.

113
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,269
Ah. Ah. Unh.

114
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,316
- Ha, ha.
- Sorry.

115
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,195
I'm used to a basement lab in a hospital
where things fall to the floor.

116
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,906
Thank you.

117
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,199
Well, you're the genius up here.

118
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,910
I only drive the bus.

119
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,786
Yeah, well, call me a genius...

120
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,623
...if I can get this board initialized
in the next hour.

121
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,499
<i>Explorer, this is Houston.</i>

122
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,209
Go ahead, Houston.

123
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,088
<i>NORAD reports a Russian
satellite has incurred a missile strike.</i>

124
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,050
<i>The impact has created a cloud of debris...</i>

125
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,510
<i>...orbiting at 20,000 miles per hour.</i>

126
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,056
<i>Current debris orbit does not overlap
with your trajectory.</i>

127
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,350
<i>We'll keep you posted on any developments.</i>

128
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,560
<i>Copy that, Houston.</i>

129
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,479
Should we be worried?

130
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,815
No, let's let the boys down there
worry for us.

131
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,861
Explorer, engage arm and pivot
to cargo bay.

132
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,571
<i>Stand by for arm maneuver.</i>

133
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,822
Aah.

134
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,242
So, doc, now that you work for NASA,
how do you like us?

135
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,703
<i>Kind of like winning the lottery, huh?</i>

136
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,957
I was just happy that they didn't cut
the funding to my research.

137
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,250
- How long was your training?
- Oh, six months.

138
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,169
<i>- Including holidays?
- Uh-huh.</i>

139
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,214
So, what is this scanning system?

140
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,465
<i>Oh, nothing, Matt.</i>

141
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,259
<i>It's just a new set of eyes
to scan the edge of the universe.</i>

142
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,055
It's designed for hospital use,
but this one's a prototype.

143
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,515
<i>Stand by for locking.</i>

144
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:57,018
- Unh.
- Listen, they don't bankroll prototypes.

145
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,813
Even for your pretty blue eyes.

146
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,191
Well, my eyes are brown.

147
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,153
Right now, your eyes are bloodshot.

148
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:11,241
<i>Kowalski! Is this great or what?</i>

149
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,540
And to think he went to Harvard.

150
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,877
You gotta admit one thing:

151
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,755
Can't beat the view.

152
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,053
So, what do you like about being up here?

153
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,640
The silence.

154
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,185
I could get used to it.

155
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:00,999
Terrific.

156
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,461
Houston, from first inspection,
comms panel appears to be dead.

157
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,172
Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary?

158
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,799
<i>You're the expert, doctor. It's your call.</i>

159
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,594
Houston, I have a bad feeling
about this mission.

160
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,262
<i>Please elaborate.</i>

161
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:18,141
It's the same feeling I had
about Mardi Gras in 1987.

162
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,226
<i>That is affirmative.</i>

163
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,605
<i>Surprisingly, Control hasn't heard
the Mardi Gras story.</i>

164
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,231
<i>Please proceed.</i>

165
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,485
Well, it's day one, and I'm bumping
my way down Bourbon Street...

166
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,112
...looking for a sister
of a friend of mine.

167
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,116
Streets are full of people, I'm thinking
there's no way I'm gonna find this girl.

168
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,534
Proceeding to override.

169
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,538
Then all of a sudden, I look up
and there she is. I'm about to yell out.

170
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,750
I see she's holding hands
with some hairy guy in board shorts...

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,543
...and a Margaritaville shirt.

172
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,755
And then I realize that
this guy is not a guy.

173
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,840
That my girl is holding hands with...

174
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,926
<i>ISS, this is Houston.</i>

175
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,553
<i>- Explorer, this is Houston.
- Go ahead, Houston.</i>

176
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,640
<i>Mission abort. Repeat, mission abort.</i>

177
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,185
<i>Initiate emergency disconnect from Hubble.
Begin reentry procedure.</i>

178
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,521
<i>ISS, initiate emergency evacuation.</i>

179
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,314
<i>Copy all, Houston, and in work.</i>

180
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,318
<i>Matt, immediate return to</i> Explorer.
<i>Repeat, immediate return to</i> Explorer.

181
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,362
Copy. Explorer, prep airlock.

182
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,281
<i>- Airlock engaged, ready to receive.
- Houston, elaborate.</i>

183
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,368
<i>Debris from the missile strike
has caused a chain reaction...</i>

184
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,995
<i>...hitting other satellites
and creating new debris.</i>

185
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:25,250
<i>Traveling faster than a high-speed bullet
up towards your altitude. All copy.</i>

186
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,501
Copy all.

187
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,169
Put a bow on it, Dr. Stone.

188
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,840
I can't. The board is still initializing.

189
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,509
- I'm not gonna ask you again.
- One second.

190
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,887
Not one second. Now. Shut it down.

191
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,764
That's an order.

192
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,517
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm done.
I'm done.

193
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,353
<i>Kowalski, initiate emergency
disconnect from the Hubble.</i>

194
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,981
- All right, Shariff, let's do this.
- Roger, <i>Matt.</i>

195
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,232
Houston, update.

196
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,317
<i>Well, we have a full-on chain reaction.</i>

197
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,445
<i>It's been confirmed that
it's the unintentional side effect...</i>

198
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,865
...of <i>the Russians striking
one of their own satellites.</i>

199
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,617
<i>- They shot down their own satellite?</i>
- Right of disposal.

200
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,787
Most likely a spy sat gone bad.
Now it's shrapnel.

201
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,622
Explorer, ready to disengage HST.

202
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,585
<i>Locks releasing in three, two, one.</i>

203
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,379
<i>Explorer, new data coming through.</i>

204
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,131
What's the blowback, Houston?

205
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,134
<i>It's not good.
Most of our systems are gone.</i>

206
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,762
<i>Debris chain reaction is out of control
and rapidly expanding.</i>

207
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,599
<i>Multiple satellites are down
and they keep on falling.</i>

208
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,350
Define "multiple satellites."

209
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,894
<i>Most of them are gone.</i>

210
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,979
<i>Telecommunication systems are dead.</i>

211
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,315
<i>Expect a communication blackout
at any moment.</i>

212
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,609
<i>Kowalski, visual of debris at 9 o'clock.</i>

213
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,111
Half of North America
just lost their Facebook.

214
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,738
Explorer, repeat...

215
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,657
<i>...expect a communication blackout
at any moment.</i>

216
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,451
<i>Copy that, Houston.</i>

217
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,038
Explorer, this is Kowalski,
confirming visual contact with debris.

218
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,456
Debris is from a BSE sat.

219
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,541
- Heads up!
- To repeat, I have...

220
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,710
<i>Dr. Stone
requesting faster transport.</i>

221
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,712
We have to go.
We have to go, go, go!

222
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,965
<i>Kennedy reports
meteorological conditions no-go...</i>

223
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,842
Houston, Explorer. Copy.

224
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,387
<i>Explorer, Dr. Stone requesting
faster transport to bay area.</i>

225

<i>Explorer, do you copy?</i>

226
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,309
- Explorer, permission to retrieve Dr. Stone.
- You're a go, Kowalski.

227
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,103
<i>Houston, this is Explorer, copy.</i>

228
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,189
- All right.
- We've <i>lost</i> Houston.

229
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,066
- Unh!
- We've <i>lost</i> Houston.

230
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,818
Unstrap. Look, we need to
get the hell out of here.

231
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,446
<i>- Need some help there, Matt?
- No, don't wait for us.</i>

232
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,864
<i>- Unh!</i>
- It's stuck!

233
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,617
Man down! Man down!

239
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,168
Aah!

240
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,545
Explorer, over. Explorer.

241
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,301
<i>Astronaut is off structure.
Dr. Stone is off structure.</i>

242
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,263
<i>- Dr. Stone, detach! You must detach!
- No!</i>

243
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,140
<i>If you don't detach,
that arm's gonna carry you too far!</i>

244
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,685
<i>- Listen to my voice! You need to focus!</i>
- I <i>can't!</i>

245
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,272
<i>I'm losing visual of you. In</i>
a <i>few seconds I won't be able to track you.</i>

246
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,481
<i>You need to detach!</i>

247
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,318
<i>- I can't see you anymore. Do it now!

<i>- Give</i> me a visual.

Kowalski, I have a visual.

I have a visual of Explorer.

265
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,643
With north at 12 o'clock...

266
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,063
...and the shuttle is at
the center of the dial.

267
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,193
I can see the Chinese station.

268
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,696
No, it's the International Space Station.

269
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,907
ISS is at...

270
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,702
ISS is at <i>7</i> o'clock.

<i>There you are. Hang on tight.</i>

<i>Your status. Give me your readings.</i>

292

Three-point-six PSI.

294
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,533
<i>Your O2, give me your O2.</i>

No, 8 percent.

297
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,332
<i>You're breathing too fast.</i>

<i>We wanna relax. Copy?</i>

300
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,421
Okay, sorry. Yes, copy.

301
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,091

302
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,219
<i>You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.</i>

303
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,846
Sorry. Sorry.

304
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,143
- Aah!
- Gotcha.

305
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,522
All right, now I'm gonna tether you to me.

306
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,819
I know, you never realized
how devastatingly good-looking I am.

307
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,781
But I need you to stop staring
and help me with the tether.

308
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:54,991
Okay?

309
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,993
Okay. Okay.

310
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,245
Uh, I got it.

311
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,914
All right, here we go.

312
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,334
Now, to clear you from the jets,
I'm gonna give you a little push.

313
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,253
- No, no, no.
- Not a push.

314
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,629
A nudge.

315
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,215
No, no, no! Damn it, no!

316
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,726
See? Where you go, I go.

317
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,566
Better.

318
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,152
Let's get out of here.

319
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,115
- Goddamn it! Agh.
- I know what you mean.

320
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,867
Damn it.

321
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,952
You're burning oxygen.

322
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,873
We're going back to the shuttle.
How's that for a plan? Copy?

323
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,082
Fuck!

324
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,876
Right. Copy that.

325
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,128
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

326
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,756
Dr. Stone and I are gonna
make our way back to base.

327
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:55,384
Can you get the Explorer to prepare
the airlock for arrival? Copy?

328
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,305
Houston, this is Kowalski.
How do you copy?

329
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,099
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

330
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,434
They can't hear us.

331
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,936
We don't know that.
That's why we keep talking.

332
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,315
If somebody is listening,
they might just save your life.

333
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,609
Set your watch for 90 minutes.

334
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,570
- Why 90?
- Houston clocked that debris...

335
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,781
...at 50,000 miles an hour.

336
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,741
If you factor in our current orbit...

337
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,620
...then I figure we got about 90 minutes
before we get our asses kicked again.

338
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,705
O2 down to 6 percent.

339
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,168
Okay. Pretty scary shit
being untethered up here, isn't it?

340
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,755
Yeah, pretty scary shit.

341
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,007
Well, you did all right.

342
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,970
Well, you weren't so bad yourself.

343
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,435
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

344
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,063
Our current location is approximately...

345
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,024
<i>...900 meters out from the Explorer.</i>

346
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,027
Dr. Stone and I would like to
retrieve the body...

347
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,029
...of Mission Specialist Shariff...

348
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,156
...and return it to the shuttle.

349
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,367
Am I a go to retrieve?

350
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,204
Roger that.

351
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,123
Where is he? Where is he?

352
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,606
Oh, my God.

353
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,861
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

354
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,491
Grab him!

355
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,996
Grab him! Agh!

356
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,414
I'm trying, I'm trying!

357
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,503
You're pulling me away.

358
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,755
I got him!

359
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,299
- Clutch him like he's your valentine.
- I got him.

360
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,552
I can't engage my thrust
with you two yo-yoing around.

361
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,375
Jesus Christ.

362
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,879
<i>Here's hoping you have a hell
of an insurance policy, Houston.</i>

363
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,381
The damages to Explorer...

364
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,634
<i>...are catastrophic.</i>

365
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,636
<i>Will commence search for survivors.</i>

366
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,930
<i>O2 down to 5 percent.</i>

367
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,849
All right, here
we go. Careful of the edges!

368
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,360
Here. Here!

369
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,038
Houston, in the blind. To confirm:

370
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:57,042
Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and
Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski...

371
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:01,005
...are the sole survivors of the STS-157.

372
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,550
I apologize for not complying.

373
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,595
I should've stopped working
as soon as you instructed me to.

374
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,305
We were gonna get hit no matter what.

375
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,724
There was nothing you could do
to change that.

376
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,854
Hey.

377
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,355
Yes?

378
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:19,773
All right...

379
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,818
...we have to make our way
to the space station.

380
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,321
Over there.

381
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,948
It's a bit of a hike...

382
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:32,202
...but we need to use their escape pod,
the Soyuz, to get back to Earth.

383
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,704
Agreed?

384
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,707
Dr. Stone...

385
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,709
...agreed?

386
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,170
Agreed.

387
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,923
All right. After you.

388
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,217
Oh, God.

389
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,313
<i>Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.</i>

390
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,233
<i>Dr. Stone and I have determined
to proceed to ISS...</i>

391
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,570
<i>...and use one of their Soyuz for reentry.</i>

392
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,365
<i>ISS, if you hear us...</i>

393
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,368
...we <i>could sure use</i> a <i>rescue mission.</i>

394
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,467
<i>O2 down to 2 percent.</i>

395
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,052
<i>We're getting there.</i>

396
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,347
<i>Beautiful, don't you think?</i>

397
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,058
<i>What?</i>

398
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,851
The sunrise.

399
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,438
That's what I'm gonna miss the most.

400
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,238
So where's home, Dr. Stone?

401
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,368
Ryan, where's home?

402
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,746
- Home?
- Mm-hm.

403
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,083
Down there. Mother Earth.

404
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,293
Where do you pitch your tent?

405
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,841
Lake Zurich.

406
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,676
Where the hell is that?

407
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:14,888
Illinois.

408
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:18,142
Illinois. Central time zone.

409
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,228
That would make it roughly...

410
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,272
...8 p.m.

411
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,900
What are the good people of Lake Zurich
doing at 8:00?

412
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,695
I don't know.

413
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,614
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm slowing you down.

414
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,408
What would you be doing?

415
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,746
Come on, Ryan.

416
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,998
It's 8200.

417
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:44,668
You've just left the hospital
after an 18-hour shift.

418
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,545
Driving home.

419
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,633
The radio.

420
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,471
I listen to the radio.

421
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,265
There we go. Let me guess.

422
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,808
NPR?

423
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,393
Classical?

424
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,187
Ton 40?

425
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:10,152
Anything. I don't care,
as long as they don't talk. I just drive.

426
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,573
And where are you driving to?

427
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,494
I just drive.

428
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,330
What do you miss down there?

429
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,792
ls there a Mr. Stone?

430
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,211
No.

431
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,296
Nobody special?

432
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,635
Somebody down there looking up...

433
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,553
...thinking about you?

434
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:39,973
Ryan?

435
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,690
I had a daughter.

436
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,120
She was 4.

437
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,124
She was at school playing tag.

438
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,418
Slipped, hit her head, and that was it.

439
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,631
Stupidest thing.

440
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,557
I was driving when I got the call, so...

441
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,269
Ever since then, that's what I do.

442
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,729
I wake up...

443
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,524
...I go to work...

444
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,609
...and I just drive.

445
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,972
O2 down to 1 percent.

446
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,236
Well, I've got good news and bad news.

447
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,989
The good news is, we're about 5 minutes
from the ISS...

448
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,575
...and I know where the Russians
stash their vodka.

449
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,037
And that is good,
because I'm running on fumes here.

450
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,163
The bad news is...

451
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,374
...I'm gonna be about 10 minutes short
of breaking Anatoly's record, and...

452
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,502
- Agh!
- What?

453
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,255
I'm redlining. My O2 tank pressure is low.

454
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,383
Your tank is out of oxygen,
but you still have it in your suit.

455
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,301
Got it.

456
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,053
So you have to sip, not gulp.

457
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,972
Wine, not beer.

458
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,766
Sip, Ryan.

459
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,394
Houston, in the blind,
we have a visual of the ISS.

460
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,564
The station must have been evacuated
because the first Soyuz...

461
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,734
...is missing. The second Soyuz
exhibits surface damage...

462
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,778
...and its chute has been deployed.

463
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:01,615
Any use as an escape pod for reentry
is impossible.

464
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,201
Shouldn't we be turning?
We're drifting again.

465
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,995
Not yet.
I wasn't kidding about those fumes.

466
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,665
This can has one or
two good thrusts left...

467
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,250
...if we're lucky.

468
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,138
Steady.

469
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,108
Aim.

470
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,235
Fire.

471
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,077
- Brake! Brake. You have to brake!
- I can't, the can's...

472
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,122
...empty. We're gonna hit hard.
Grab a hold of anything you can!

473
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,510
What do I do?

474
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,096
What do I do?

475
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:15,897
Ryan!

476
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,781
The tether broke, I'm detached!
I'm detached!

477
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,283
Grab a hold!

478
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,619
Grab anything!

479
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,304
Ryan!

480
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,558
- Give me five.
- I've got you.

481
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,894
I've got you. Right here.

482
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,440
Shit!

483
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,026
No, no, no!

484
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,487
Got you.

485
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,081
Got you.

486
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,878
You just hold on,
and I'm gonna start pulling you in.

487
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:20,796
Hey, doc.

488
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,631
Just hold on. Hang on.

489
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,092
- I am gonna pull you in.
- Ryan, listen.

490
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,426
You have to let me go.

491
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,011
- No.
- The ropes are too loose.

492
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,262
I'm pulling you with me.

493
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,265
- Let me go or we both die.
- I'm not letting you go!

494
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,809
We're fine! Unh.

495
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,143
- Agh!
- No.

496
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,650
Ryan, let go.

497
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,652
No. No.

498
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,071
You're not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere.

499
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,865
- It's not up to you.
- No, no, no.

500
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,118
Please don't do this.

501
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,453
Please, please, please.
Please don't do this.

502
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,456
Please don't do this. No, no, no.
Please don't, Matt.

503
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,333
Please don't do this.

504
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,712
You're gonna make it, Ryan.

505
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,298
No!

506
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,990
I had you. I had you. I had you.

507
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,340
<i>Ryan, do you hear me?</i>

508
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,553
<i>Do you copy?</i>

509
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:55,390
My CO2 alarm went off.
My CO2 alarm went off.

510
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,684
<i>Look, you need to board the station.</i>

511
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,853
<i>Do you see the airlock?</i>

512
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,614
<i>Hey, Ryan.</i>

513
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,908
<i>You COPY?</i>

514
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,244
<i>Look for the airlock.</i>

515
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,833
<i>It's above you, next to the Zarya module.</i>

516
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,630
<i>You see it?</i>

517
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,175
Yes. Yes, I see it. I see it.

518
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,220
<i>All right, good. That's where you wanna go.</i>

519
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,805
<i>Now you're getting light-headed, right?</i>

520
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,682
Yeah. Yes.

521
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,268
<i>That's because you're breathing CO2.</i>

522
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,270
<i>You're losing consciousness.</i>

523
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,064
<i>You need to board the station.</i>

524
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,398
OK.

525
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,902
<i>That second</i> Soyuz
<i>is too damaged for reentry...</i>

526
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,947
<i>...but it's perfectly fine
for a little Sunday drive.</i>

527
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,573
Sunday drive?

528
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,575
<i>Look to the west.</i>

529
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,120
<i>You see that dot in the distance?</i>

530
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,789
<i>That's a Chinese station.</i>

531
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:01,790
Yes.

532
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,085
<i>You're gonna take the Soyuz,
and you're gonna cruise over there.</i>

533
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,880
<i>Chinese lifeboat is</i> a Shenzhou.

534
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,840
I've never flown a Shenzhou.

535
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,133
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

536
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,679
<i>Its reentry protocol is
identical to the</i> Soyuz.

537
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,931
OK.

538
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,102
<i>You never flown the Soyuz either?</i>

539
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,062
Only a simulator.

540
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,189
<i>Well, then you know.</i>

541
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,068
But I crashed it.

542
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,196
<i>It's a simulator,
that's what it's designed for.</i>

543
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,242
Every time.

544
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,411
I crashed it every time.

545
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,914
<i>You point the damn thing
at Earth. It's not rocket science.</i>

546
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,794
<i>And by this time tomorrow, you're gonna be back
in Lake Zurich with a hell of a story to tell.</i>

547
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,130
<i>You COPY?</i>

548
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,300
<i>Ryan, you copy?</i>

549
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,261
- I'm gonna take the Soyuz and come get you.
- No, you're not.

550
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,180
<i>- I'm coming to get</i> you.
<i>- I've got too much of a head start.</i>

551
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,851
<i>- I'm coming to get</i> you.
<i>- I'm afraid that ship already sailed.</i>

552
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,062
<i>Ryan, you're gonna have to learn to let go.</i>

553
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,565
- But I...
<i>- I</i> wanna hear you <i>say...</i>

554
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,816
<i>...you're gonna make it.</i>

555
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,528
<i>Come on, Ryan, say it.</i>

556
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,823
I'm gonna make it.

557
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,950
<i>All right. Keep going.</i>

558
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,204
<i>What kind of a name is Ryan for a girl?</i>

559
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,374
Dad wanted a boy.

560
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,918
<i>Are you close to the airlock?</i>

561
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:30,920
Not yet.

562
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,505
<i>Keep going.</i>

563
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,717
<i>So now that we have some distance
between us...</i>

564
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,677
<i>...you're attracted to me, right?</i>

565
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:38,637
What?

566
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:42,432
<i>Well, people
say I have beautiful blue eyes.</i>

567
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,146
You have beautiful...

568
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,523
You have beautiful blue eyes.

569
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,233
<i>I have brown eyes.</i>

570
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,530
<i>Hey, you wanna know the good news?</i>

571
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:58,490
What?

572
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,492
<i>I'm gonna break Anatoly's record...</i>

573
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,911
...and <i>I think mine's
gonna stand for</i> a <i>long, long time.</i>

574
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,955
Oh, no. I'm coming to get you.

575
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,293
Oh, my God.

576
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,128
What? What?

577
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,797
<i>Wow.</i>

578
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,424
<i>Hey, Ryan?</i>

579
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:17,926
Yeah?

580
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,095
<i>You should see the sun on the Ganges.</i>

581
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,516
<i>It's amazing.</i>

582
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,451
Where are you? Where are you?
Comms. Comms.

583
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,411
There you are. Okay.

584
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,174
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

585
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,721
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

586
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,645
Matt, I made it, I'm here,
I'm on the station. Do you copy?

587
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,569
Come on, Matt, talk to me.

588
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,489
Tell me where you are,
give me your position.

589
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:36,077
Where are you? Give me a visual.
Just tell me what you see.

590
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,751
Oh, come on. You've been yammering
since we left Cape Canaveral.

591
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,920
Now you decide to shut up? Talk to me.

592
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,132
Just say something, say anything.
I don't care.

593
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,681
Hey.

594
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,852
Tell me about, uh, Mardi Gras.
Tell me about the hairy guy.

595
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,937
Huh? Tell me what happened.

596
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,565
What happened to the, uh, hairy guy?

597
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,364
Please talk to me.

598
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,245
Please.

599
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,721
Houston, in the blind...

600
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:43,102
...this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone
reporting from the ISS.

601
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,857
All communications with
Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski...

602
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,567
...have been lost.

603
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,947
Radio transmission absent.

604
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,910
Visuals nonexistent.

605
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,997
To confirm...

606
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,751
...I, Ryan Stone, am the sole survivor...

607
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,545
...of STS-157.

608
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,185
What now?

609
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,840
Agh.

610
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:01,949
OK.

611
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,038
Okay. Where is it, where is it?

612
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,332
Where is the power? Here you are.

613
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,961
Okay, great, just like training.

614
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,839
Undocking, undocking.

615
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,424
Undocking.

616
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:20,635
Red.

617
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,099
OK.

618
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,978
Okay, where is it?

619
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:31,938
Where is it?

620
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,273
Come on.

621
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,359
OK.

622
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,365
Okay. Okay, I remember this.
I remember this.

623
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:59,340
Oh, you don't have four minutes.
We're going manual.

624
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,176
Come on.

625
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,761
OK.

626
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:07,431
Okay. Activate... Activate undock.

627
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,545
Seven minutes to get out of here.

628
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,470
All right, okay.

629
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:03,112
What? What, what?

630
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,832
No, no, no!

631
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,395
Unh! Agh.

632
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,280
Stop, stop, STOP!

633
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,341
That's right, that's right.
Come on, come on.

634
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,469
That's right, that's right, that's right.

635
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,012
Ahh.

636
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:11,472
Come on.

637
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:48,884
Great.

638
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:38,934
Clear skies with a
chance of satellite debris.

639
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:55,719
Okay, we detach this and we go home.
Piece of cake.

640
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,705
OK.

641
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,711
Okay, what do we have?

642
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,879
Okay, all right.

643
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,683
Shit.

644
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,234
Okay, come on.

645
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,819
Come on, come on.

646
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,154
All right.

647
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,871
I hate space.

648
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,101
Shut up.

649
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,940
OK.

650
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,366
All right.

651
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,080
That's good.

652
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:12,833
OK.

653
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,336
Let's stabilize you.

654
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:32,728
OK.

655
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,815
Let's go visit the Chinese station.

656
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,234
Houston, in the blind...

657
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:43,113
Tiangong is approximately
100 kilometers...

658
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,282
...to the west...

659
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,827
...and I am off its course by about...

660
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,621
...13 degrees.

661
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:53,165
I will correct trajectory.

662
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,188
OK.

663
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:18,273
OK.

664
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,150
OK.

665
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,153
I will engage S-Ka-Dae...

666
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,281
...in five, four, three...

667
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:27,783
...two, one.

668
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,259
What's happening, what's happening?
Come on, come on.

669
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:48,679
One.

670
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:04,570
Come on, come OH, come on.

671
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,535
You gotta be kidding me.

672
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,745
You gotta be kidding me!

673
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:19,835
No! Don't you fu...

674
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,972
<i>Houston, in the blind.</i>

675
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,058
<i>Houston, in the blind,
this is Dr. Ryan Stone.</i>

676
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:39,313
<i>I'm calling from the Soyuz TMA-14M.</i>

677
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:43,066
<i>I'm currently out of fuel and adrift,
do you copy?</i>

678
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:49,406
<i>Houston. This is Dr. Ryan Stone.</i>

679
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:51,491
<i>Do you copy?</i>

680
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:59,041
<i>Houston. This is Ryan Stone.</i>

681
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,500
<i>Do you copy?</i>

682
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:06,715
Houston, this is Mission...
Mission Specialist Ryan Stone.

683
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:07,966
Do you copy?

684
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:13,305
Houston. Houston, please confirm identity.

685
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,224
Houston, you're coming in
over an AM frequency. Copy.

686
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,895
Do you copy?

687
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,565
Is this the Chinese station?
Is this Tiangong? Copy.

688
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,069
Mayday, can you copy?

689
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,655
Mayday, mayday. Mayday.

690
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,200
- Mayday.
- Yes, yes. Mayday, mayday.

691
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,994
- Mayday.
- Mayday, mayday.

692
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:39,081
<i>Aningaaq.</i>

693
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,294
- Aningaaq, is that your name?
- Aningaaq.

694
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:47,881
- Aningaaq is your name? Is that your name?
- Mayday. Aningaaq.

695
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,384
<i>Aningaaq. Mayday-</i>

696
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,636
No, no, no. No, my name is not mayday.

697
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,138
I'm Stone. Dr. Ryan Stone.

698
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,890
I need help. I am...

699
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,521
Those are dogs.

700
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,107
They're calling from Earth.

701
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:11,488
- They're calling from Earth.
- Ha-ha-ha!

702
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:24,793
Aningaaq...

703
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:28,505
...make your dogs bark again for me,
would you, please?

704
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:33,093
Your dogs. Dogs, you know.

705
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,595
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Woof, woof. Dogs.

706
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,944
Woof, woof.

707
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,808
Oh, I'm gonna die, Aningaaq.

708
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:27,355
I know, we're all gonna die.
Everybody knows that.

709
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,358
But I'm gonna die today.

710
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,071
Funny, that.

711
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,281
You know, to know...

712
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:42,370
But the thing is, it's
that I'm still scared.

713
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,790
I'm really scared.

714
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,088
Nobody will mourn for me,
no one will pray for my soul.

715
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,009
Will you mourn for me?

716
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,513
Will you say a prayer for me?

717
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,848
Or is it too late?

718
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:10,023
I mean, I'd say one for myself,
but I've never prayed in my life, so...

719
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,443
Nobody ever taught me how.

720
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,783
Nobody ever taught me how.

721
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,546
A baby.

722
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,811
There's a baby with you, huh?

723
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,357
Is that a lullaby you're singing?

724
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,820
That's so sweet.

725
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,658
I used to sing to my baby.

726
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,497
I hope I see her soon.

727
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:21,154
That's nice, Aningaaq.
Keep singing, just like that.

728
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,325
Sing me to sleep, and I'll sleep.

729
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:30,747
Keep singing. And sing and sing.

730
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,237
No, no, no, don't!

731
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,241
Check your watch.
Thirteen hours and 11 minutes.

732
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,119
Call Anatoly and tell him he's been bumped.

733
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,705
- It's a little gloomy in here, isn't it'?
- How did you...?

734
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,750
- Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
- But how did you...?

735
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,545
That's better.

736
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:04,924
I found a little extra...
A little extra battery power.

737
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:07,677
It helps that I didn't have you around
to distract me.

738
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,180
I have to say, I'm glad to see you.

739
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:12,265
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

740
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,933
Did you find the vodka?

741
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:18,646
- You never told me where it was, $0...
- Oh, well...

742
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:20,440
Ah, ah!

743
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,779
To Anatoly.

744
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:35,288
Huh? No? All right.

745
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:37,791
Let's get out of here.

746
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,503
The Chinese station's about 100 miles.

747
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:44,214
Just a little Sunday drive.

748
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:45,924
- We can't.
- Sure we can.

749
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:49,886
- There's no fuel, I tried everything.
- Well, there's always something we can do.

750
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,262
I tried everything.

751
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,139
Did you try the soft landing jets?

752
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,641
They're for landing, so...

753
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,727
Landing is launching. It's the same.
Didn't you learn that in training?

754
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:01,272
- I never got to land the simulator, I told you.
- But you know about it.

755
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:04,984
- And I crashed it every time.
- Do you wanna go back or stay here?

756
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:10,323
I get it, it's nice up here.

757
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:17,330
You can just shut down all the systems...

758
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,125
...turn out all the lights...

759
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,045
...and just close your eyes
and tune out everybody.

760
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,423
There's nobody up here that can hurt you.

761
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,508
It's safe.

762
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:34,848
I mean, what's the point of going on?
What's the point of living?

763
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:43,106
Your kid died.
Doesn't get any rougher than that.

764
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,153
But still, it's a matter
of what you do now.

765
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:53,199
If you decide to go,
then you gotta just get on with it.

766
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:56,286
Sit back, enjoy the ride.

767
01:05:56,870 --> 01:06:00,290
You gotta plant both your feet
on the ground and start living life.

768
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,000
How did you get here?

769
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,461
I'm telling you, it's a hell of a story.

770
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:06,212
Hey, Ryan?

771
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,589
What?

772
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:09,674
It's time to go home.

773
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,677
Landing...

774
01:06:57,055 --> 01:07:00,099
Landing... Landing is launching.

775
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:02,936
I said...

776
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,326
Okay, landing, landing.

777
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,370
Landing is green.

778
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,288
Agh.

779
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,131
OK.

780
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,719
Okay, landing. All right.

781
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:40,348
Okay. Soft landing jets
trigger automatically...

782
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,809
...at 3 meters before landing, so...

783
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,939
Oh, you're a clever son of a bitch, Matt.

784
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:51,818
I need to... I need to
get rid of the Bay-O...

785
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,362
...and the engine module.

786
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:56,614
Right. Okay.

787
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:58,283
OK.

788
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:01,995
OK.

789
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,499
Tri-module separation.

790
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:08,251
Go.

791
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,767
OK.

792
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,895
Houston, here's the tricky part.

793
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,231
Soyuz has to think...

794
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:33,818
...we are
3 meters off the Earth.

795
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:37,697
All right. Okay.

796
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:39,198
Hey, Matt?

797
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,743
Since I had to listen to endless hours...

798
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,954
...of your storytelling this week,
I need you to do me a favor.

799
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,917
You are gonna see
a little girl with brown hair...

800
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,837
...very messy, lots of knots.

801
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,881
She doesn't like to brush it.

802
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:56,758
That's okay.

803
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,093
Her name is Sarah.

804
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,221
Can you please tell her...

805
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,974
...that Mama found her red shoe?

806
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:08,269
She was so worried about that shoe, Matt.

807
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,396
But it was just right under the bed.

808
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:15,526
Give her...

809
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:19,280
...a big hug and a big kiss for me
and tell her that Mama misses her.

810
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,408
You tell her that she is my angel.

811
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:26,120
And she makes me so proud. So, so proud.

812
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,670
And you tell her that I'm not quitting.

813
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,970
You tell her that I love her, Matt.

814
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:46,391
You tell her that I love her so much.

815
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:50,478
Can you do that for me?

816
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:54,732
Roger that.

817
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,319
Here we go.

818
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,525
You're losing altitude, Tiangong.

819
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:43,614
You keep dropping
and you're gonna kiss the atmosphere.

820
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,868
But not without me
because you're my last ride.

821
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,248
Wait.

822
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:00,840
Five.

823
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,259
<i>Four.</i>

824
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:05,678
Three...

825
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,431
No more just driving.

826
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:11,476
Let's go home.

827
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,358
Okay, come on.
Come on. Come on.

828
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:21,778
Steady, steady.

829
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:24,781
Come on. Come on. Agh!

830
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:31,746
Where are you? Where are you?
Forty-five, 90, 180.

831
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:33,122
One-eighty.

832
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:34,665
Agh!

833
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:41,798
Come on.

834
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:52,683
OK.

835
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,953
Damn it. Agh!

836
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:52,994
Agh!

837
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:41,083
Shit!

838
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:52,386
<i>Shenzhou, come on.</i>

839
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,305
<i>Shenzhou. Shenzhou.</i>

840
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:55,806
Fuck!

841
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:57,058
Okay, this way.

842
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:59,912
In the Soyuz, the power button is...

843
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:01,414
...here.

844
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,086
Okay, uh, undocking, undocking. Um...

845
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:09,130
Uh, eenie, meenie...

846
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,091
Okay, that doesn't sound good.

847
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:13,592
Minie...

848
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:14,760
...mo.

849
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:21,058
Minie...

850
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:22,435
...mo.

851
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,312
Okay. Okay, good.

852
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,490
Houston. Houston, in the blind.

853
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:40,411
This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone
reporting from the Shenzhou.

854
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:43,330
I'm about to undock from Tiangong.

855
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,624
Uh...

856
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:50,713
And I have a bad feeling
about this mission. Ha, ha.

857
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:55,092
Reminds me of a story, Houston. Aah!

858
01:15:57,178 --> 01:16:01,182
Never... Never mind the story, Houston.
Never mind the story.

859
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:06,687
It's getting hot in here. Okay. All right.

860
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:08,689
OK.

861
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,442
All right, the way I see it...

862
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,694
...there's only two possible outcomes.

863
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:15,988
Either I make it down there in one piece...

864
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,657
...and I have one
hell of a story to tell...

865
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:20,951
...or I burn up in the next 10 minutes.

866
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:22,703
Aah.

867
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:25,247
Either way, whichever way...

868
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:28,375
...no harm, no foul! Aah!

869
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:36,634
Because either way...

870
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:41,222
...it'll be one hell of a ride.

871
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:44,892
I'm ready.

872
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:52,853
<i>Shenzhou, in the blind...</i>

873
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:56,106
<i>...this is Houston. Indicate FM frequency.</i>

874
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,110
<i>Our radars detect you
on a reentry trajectory.</i>

875
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,696
<i>If you copy, please confirm identity.</i>

876
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:24,969
<i>This is Houston...</i>

877
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,187
<i>Please confirm identity.</i>

878
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,481
<i>Skies over the Midwest
are completely clear...</i>

879
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,778
<i>Rescue mission is on the way.</i>

880
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,659
<i>Shenzhou, in the blind, this is Houston.</i>

881
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:53,038
<i>We've deployed a rescue mission...</i>

882
01:19:54,999 --> 01:19:56,500
Our radar...

883
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:45,836
Thank you.

884
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:54,636
No.

885
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:52,238
Three, two...

886
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:52,655
...one, <i>mark.</i>

887
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:54,658
...one, <i>mark.</i>
