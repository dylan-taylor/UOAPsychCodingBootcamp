1
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,610
Chick, chick, chick.

2
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,252
Tobe, stop that doggone racket.

3
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,684
<i>Quiet, Tobe.</i>

4
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,686
How far to Lordsburg?

5
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,856
It's about ten miles that way.

6
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,025
Thank you.

7
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,949
Good afternoon, ma'am.

8
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,193
Six sacks of grain.

9
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,196
My horse limps. Take him over to the smithy
and tell him I'll be along in a few minutes.

10
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:55,034
Sure.

11
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,385
- Yes, sir? What'll it be?
- I'd like a room.

12
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,796
A room? We don't
get much hotel business...

13
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,175
around here
this time of the year.

14
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,178
Sign right there.

15
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,931
Planning to be around long?

16
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,100
Not long.

17
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,774
That'll be room number seven,
to the right at the top of the stairs.

18
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:34,491
Oh, that's a buck and a half
in advance.

19
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,571
I'll pay when I leave.

20
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,745
Okay. Forget I mentioned it.

21
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,461
We change sheets
on Friday, Mr. Grant.

22
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:57,556
The name is Gant. John Gant.

23
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,055
Did I hear right?

24
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:09,934
- Did he say-
- He said "Gant.“

25
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:14,063
Him? That kid?

26
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,233
That's him. Sid.

27
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,402
- <i>Sid!</i>
- Yes, Mr. Reeger?

28
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:24,283
- Go tell the sheriff.
- Yes, sir.

29
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,420
Whoa, there, Sid.

30
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,422
Somebody finally catch you
waterin' the whiskey?

31
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,550
- Can't stop, Earl. I gotta go!
- What's the rush?

32
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,972
- It's Gant. John Gant. He's here!
- What do ya mean?

33
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:47,598
He just rode up.
I gotta tell the sheriff.

34
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,433
Gant, here?

35
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,644
What's he want here?

36
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:57,650
Don't you know?
Same thing he wants anywhere.

37
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,118
Fixed the lock. There wasn't
anything serious wrong with it.

38
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:06,198
Buck! Oh. Buck!

39
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,871
- He's here. He's right here in town.
- You don't say.

40
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:09,989
Who's that, Sid?

41
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:13,340
Gant! John Gant. He just
took a room at the hotel.

42
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:16,000
- He just get in?
- Just this minute.

43
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,587
- Well.
- "Well"? Is that all?

44
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,009
- You want me to cheer?
- Who's John Gant, Buck?

45
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,136
Well, you've got to do something
about it! Mr. Reeger said-

46
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:29,221
I don't care what Mr. Reeger said!
There's nothing I can do.

47
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,813
- Well, if you can't, who can?
- Who's he talkin' about?

48
00:06:32,814 --> 00:06:35,187
- You mean you really don't know?
- I asked, didn't I?

49
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:38,358
- He's a killer.
- So what? We've had some pretty good ones.

50
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:40,700
- We've been able to handle them.
- No, no.

51
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,861
A gunman is one thing.
Gant's another.

52
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,614
Why, he's killed 20 or 30 men.
For money!

53
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,706
He just goes into a town and kills 'em!
Like that.

54
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:52,955
- He's a-Well, an assassin.
- How come he's still loose?

55
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:55,876
He prods them into it.
You know as well as I do.

56
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:58,969
You can make any man fight
if you try hard enough.

57
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,961
He makes them draw first...

58
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,714
then he kills them
in front of witnesses.

59
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,467
Sid, did he say how long
he was gonna stay?

60
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,928
No, he-he didn't say nothin'.

61
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,348
Buck, who do you suppose
he's after?

62
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,728
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe he isn't after anyone at all.

63
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:20,564
Mmm. He took a room.
He's not just passing through.

64
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,691
Yeah. Well, it could be anyone.

65
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,319
Anyone that has an enemy
that hates him enough.

66
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,321
Why don't you tell me
who he's after?

67
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,037
- What are you gonna do? Pick him up?
- On what charge?

68
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:32,627
Because he makes
Henry Reeger nervous?

69
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,620
Let me tell ya.

70
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,716
You watch some of our
respected citizens from now on.

71
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,917
You're gonna learn something.

72
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,419
And I'll tell you something else.

73
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,798
I've been a lawman here
for a good many years.

74
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,641
I can think of quite a few people
that'd like to see <i>me</i> dead.

75
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:52,264
Everybody steps
on somebody else's toes sometime.

76
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,603
You're the boss,
but if he's as bad as you say...

77
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:56,600
it's not gonna be nice
havin' him around.

78
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,769
I know it.

79
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,397
But we'll just have to
wait him out.

80
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:05,442
If I can pick him up
or run him out of town, I will.

81
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:10,197
If I can. But I can't do it
without an excuse.

82
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,371
We just have to wait
him out, that's all.

83
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,003
You gonna play or aren't ya?

84
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,445
Hello, Dutch.

85
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,530
"Dutch"? Who's Dutch?

86
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,367
- I don't know.
- Well, aren't you a Dutchman?

87
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,042
What's that got to do with it?
He wasn't talking to me.

88
00:08:58,043 --> 00:09:00,372
What are you worried about, then?

89
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,588
What do you think?
He makes me nervous!

90
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:05,381
Well, you're not the only one.
That's all for me.

91
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:08,348
- Well, are we playin' or ain't we?
- Without me.

92
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:10,341
Me too.

93
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,138
Think he's after you, Henry?

94
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,140
What would he want with me?

95
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,143
I wouldn't know.
Thought maybe you would.

96
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,562
Could be after anyone.

97
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,033
What are you pushing me for, Ben?
Maybe he's after you.

98
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,244
Maybe you're right, Dutch.
Maybe he is.

99
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,148
Howdy. I'll be right with ya.

100
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,392
There. That your horse?

101
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,440
- That's right.
- That's a beautiful animal, well cared for.

102
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:08,941
You can tell a lot about a man
by examining his horse.

103
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,276
- I'm Luke Canfield.
<i>- Doc!</i> Doc!

104
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,702
You know who
just came into town, big as... life?

105
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,246
I-I'm sorry, Doc.
I-I didn't know you was busy!

106
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:22,248
- That's all right, Sid. Who came into town?
- Well-

107
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:24,215
Never mind.
I-It ain't important.

108
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,256
- My horse all right?
- He's fine. Just needed a shoe.

109
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:34,303
- You can take him now, Mister-Uh-
- Gant. He called you “Doc."

110
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:36,598
<i>- That's right.
- Hey, Luke! Gimme a hand.</i>

111
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:39,680
- All right.
- Clear that stump for me.

112
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,682
My father, Asa, Mr. Gant.

113
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:46,439
<i>- He's the blacksmith. I'm just a helper.
- Your name's Gant?</i>

114
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,780
That's right. John Gant.

115
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,418
Howdy, Mr. Gant.

116
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,629
- Your son's a doctor?
- That's right.

117
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,172
I'm what passes for one
here in Lordsburg.

118
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:13,968
Don't let him fool you, Mr. Gant.
He's the best in the Southwest.

119
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:16,386
<i>That boy, he'll fix you
if you're ailin'.</i>

120
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:19,350
Or if your horse is ailin'.
I'm also the vet.

121
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:21,810
- You stayin' here in town?
- The Soledad.

122
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:25,436
I'm goin' that way. I'll walk with you,
sort of show you around.

123
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,860
- Have to rebuild that wall every year.
- Nothin' like workin' in a smith's, Mr. Gant...

124
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,029
to keep your body in trim.

125
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,239
Dad is a perfect example.

126
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,367
- You comin' home?
- No, I'll clean up first.

127
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,963
Mr. Gant, I'll take your horse over to the
stable. They'll take good care of it.

128
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:48,834
- That'll be fine.
- Are you ready?

129
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:02,016
It's a nice town-small enough to be
comfortable, but large enough to have a future.

130
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:03,639
You seem to like it here.

131
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,860
A town worth livin' in
is a town worth bein' proud of.

132
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:10,395
Luke the Physician.
You were well named.

133
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,526
That's my father's idea. He made up his
mind I'd be a doctor before I was born.

134
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:17,072
I never had a chance.
What's your line, Mr. Gant?

135
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:20,244
- Hi, Doc.
- You might say we're in related fields.

136
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:22,574
I cure things too.

137
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,040
A smithy's an unusual place
to find a physician.

138
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:29,633
I've got an office over the bank, but it's
pretty hard to get a sick horse up those stairs!

139
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:34,044
Well, you old mummy.
There you go, sleepin' again. Wake up!

140
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,880
I wasn't sleepin'.
I was thinkin'.

141
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,383
Well, then do it
with your eyes open.

142
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,307
You been 20 minutes!

143
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,222
Hey, Luke!
You got time for a game?

144
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,271
This old coot can't stay awake.

145
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:50,237
Wish I had, Charlie.
I can't now.

146
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,778
- Do you play chess?
- Oh, I play at it.

147
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,865
Well, I'd like to play you
a game, Physician.

148
00:12:57,866 --> 00:13:01,326
- You'd make a good opponent.
- You gonna be in town for a while? Why not?

149
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:04,121
- I'll be here for a while.
- We've got a date.

150
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,817
Did you lose something, Anne?

151
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,816
Luke Canfield,
since I was here last week...

152
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,277
how could a house get so messy?

153
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,993
It's a wonder you don't
tether your horse on that table.

154
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:44,514
What's the matter
with the table?

155
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:47,331
If you don't know, it's not
gonna do any good to tell you.

156
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:49,328
- Where's your father?
- He'll be along.

157
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,297
So we've got to hurry.

158
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,295
- What's for supper?
- Oh, you're going to be a romantic husband.

159
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,798
I've had a hard day
with one dyspeptic old woman...

160
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,516
one small boy's stomach-ache,
a gashed foot and a limping horse.

161
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:08,640
- That makes a man hungry.
- I hope Asa hurries. The roast is ready.

162
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:12,519
He wouldn't miss a Tuesday night supper
for anything. That makes his whole week.

163
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,897
- How's your father?
- Oh, he had another bad night.

164
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,363
He seems to be better
during the day.

165
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:22,363
Sometimes the climate here
does remarkable things for consumption.

166
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:24,363
Sometimes.

167
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,914
I'm doing everything I can,
everything I know how to do.

168
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:30,879
I wish I knew more, but I don't.

169
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,966
Let's take a look at the roast.

170
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,224
You ought to be as fat as a bull,
the way you keep shoveling it in.

171
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:50,686
After a week of what <i>you</i> do to food,
this is heaven.

172
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:53,053
Why is it everything you cook
tastes like a prescription?

173
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:54,481
What makes you think it isn't?

174
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:58,730
I suspicioned it. You better watch him
after you get married.

175
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:03,077
- He'll slip cod liver oil in the soup.
- Cod liver oil is good for you.

176
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:05,242
I'll get it.

177
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,079
- Good evening, Doc.
- Oh, come in, Sheriff.

178
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,583
- <i>Oh, you're just havin' supper?
- We just finished.</i>

179
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:19,381
- Hi, Asa. Hello, Anne.
- Evening, Sheriff.

180
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:21,711
What's on your mind, Sheriff?

181
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,298
- You talked with John Gant today.
- That's right.

182
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,552
- You know who he is?
- Uh, he's John Gant, I guess.

183
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,976
- I know.
- Am I supposed to know something I don't?

184
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:35,068
That's right. You spent a lot of time
back East in school.

185
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:37,436
All right. Who is he?

186
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,771
He's a killer, Doc.

187
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,070
- Didn't act like one. Cup of coffee, Buck?
- Yeah, please.

188
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:46,071
He's a hired assassin.
He was sent here to kill somebody.

189
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:48,910
- That's his job.
- You sound mighty positive.

190
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:50,907
You know
the man's reputation, Asa.

191
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,912
Sure, but that's all I know.
I don't know the man.

192
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:55,912
Well, in this case
the reputation is the man.

193
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,835
- I doubt that, Buck.
- What makes you so sure?

194
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:02,675
Because he always works the same way.
He comes into a town, checks into a hotel.

195
00:16:02,676 --> 00:16:05,765
Sticks around a few days,
sizing up the situation.

196
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:10,510
Then he picks a fight with his man.
He's never lost yet.

197
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,766
Just hearsay, Buck. You can't condemn
a man on what you hear about him.

198
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:18,688
No, Asa. It's common knowledge.
Every lawman knows about him.

199
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:21,485
I got a stack of reports
from other states on him.

200
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:25,525
I'll admit I've never seen him,
but... I'm convinced.

201
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:29,656
You sound awfully sure he's after
somebody here. Who do you think it is?

202
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:33,000
- I thought maybe you could tell me.
- What makes you think I can?

203
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:35,160
You talked to him.

204
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:39,587
Maybe he dropped a hint. Did he
mention any names, ask about anyone?

205
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:43,126
- No. We talked about chess.
- Chess?

206
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,300
Yeah. We're gonna play a game.

207
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,510
Yeah, that figures, all right.

208
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:55,309
Someday, Doc, you're gonna start living
in the same world with the rest of us.

209
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,732
Half of this town is scared that Gant's gonna
kill 'em, and you're gonna play chess with him.

210
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:01,603
Why shouldn't he, Buck?

211
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,857
Until we know better,
Gant's just another man.

212
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:07,526
Even if he's what you say,
he's not after Luke or me.

213
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,528
Maybe.

214
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,658
It's a rare man that hasn't
made an enemy sometime in his life.

215
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:17,538
A man's guilt's his own burden, Buck,
and you can't do anything about it.

216
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,505
I might have to.

217
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,291
Doc...

218
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,169
if Gant stays here,
somebody's gonna die.

219
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,715
Now, that might be
the least that could happen.

220
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,927
Well, you go ahead
and play chess with him.

221
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,929
Maybe you'll learn something.

222
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,934
Assuming what you say is true,
why don't you move against him now?

223
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:42,858
I can't. I've got to have a legal reason.
Gant isn't a wanted man.

224
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,438
Anyhow, I-

225
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,909
I'm not sure I could stop him,
even if I had a reason.

226
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,611
Don't let yourself
get stampeded, Buck.

227
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,162
I'm sure everything can be worked out
peacefully if you really want it that way.

228
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:57,367
It takes two to make peace.

229
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:01,043
Gant's like a disease that
they haven't found a cure for.

230
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,875
Except for this.

231
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,846
He's supposed to be better
with this kind of medicine than anyone.

232
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,142
- Goodnight, Doc.
- Goodnight, Sheriff.

233
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,728
Gant. John Gant?

234
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:28,154
- Yeah. Do you know him, Judge?
- Well, I know of him.

235
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:30,072
So he's here.

236
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,281
- What's the matter, Judge?
- Huh? Nothing.

237
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,331
I guess I should have taken
your advice and gone to bed.

238
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:41,453
I'm a little tired.

239
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,458
Now you're being smart.
Take your medicine and get some sleep.

240
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:46,458
No. No more medicine.

241
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,554
You've gotta take it, Judge.
You may as well face facts.

242
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:53,590
This medicine is-
Well, you're still alive.

243
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,217
Yes, I'm still alive.

244
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,188
But does it really matter
how a man dies, or when...

245
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:01,899
when he knows it's gonna happen?

246
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,357
You see that he takes it.

247
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,030
Gant ain't done a thing, Ben.

248
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:15,234
Last night he sat over there
drinking coffee until late.

249
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:17,056
Didn't talk to anybody at all.

250
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,000
Yes, Mr. Gant?

251
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,924
Give me some silver
for this, will ya?

252
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,992
- I'd like some coffee.
- Right, Mr. Gant.

253
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,745
There.

254
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,000
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure!

255
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,049
I just saw them
talking together.

256
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:21,264
I told you we shouldn't
have tried to force Chaffee out, Earl!

257
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:23,477
He found the mine.
We only financed it.

258
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:25,937
Stop sniveling.
It's a perfectly sound business deal.

259
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:30,484
- Chaffee doesn't think it's just business.
- He'd do the same thing to us.

260
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:32,480
So that's why he hired Gant.

261
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,653
He wants sole ownership
of the mine. Use your head!

262
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:37,904
If he gets rid of us,
he's got it all!

263
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,874
- What are we gonna do?
- How do I know?

264
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,919
- I should never have listened to you in the first place.
- Oh, shut up.

265
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,912
The money isn't worth it!

266
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,206
Money?

267
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,167
That might do it.

268
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,967
Money brought Gant here.
Maybe it can get him to leave.

269
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,173
Come on.

270
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,175
- Where to?
- To see Gant.

271
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,804
- Why do I have to go?
- You wanna stay alive, don't you?

272
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:04,771
This is your only chance!

273
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,119
Yes, Mr. Gant?

274
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,996
- Some more coffee.
- I'll have to make some fresh.

275
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:29,873
- Then make it.
- Yes, sir. I'll be right back.

276
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,222
Mr. Gant?

277
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,686
I'm Earl Stricker.
This is Thad Pierce.

278
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:55,230
- We've come to talk to you.
- Talk.

279
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,199
Well, can we, uh-

280
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,158
<i>All right if we sit down?</i>

281
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,868
We know why you're here.

282
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,912
You do?

283
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:15,792
I'll, uh, get right to it, Mr. Gant.
We wanna make a deal.

284
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,961
You don't say.

285
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,296
What kind of a deal?

286
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,642
Whatever you were paid to come here,
we'll-we'll double it...

287
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,635
if you'll leave right now.

288
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,846
Why?

289
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,014
<i>I-Isn't it obvious?</i>

290
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:34,185
<i>Yes. It's obvious.</i>

291
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,771
If it isn't enough...

292
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,024
you can name your own price.

293
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,861
<i>- Do you run a business?
- Yeah.</i>

294
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,331
- A couple of 'em.
- I own the bank.

295
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,288
You heard I'm for sale,
and you think I can be bought off.

296
00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:52,914
What makes you think
I'd be interested in you?

297
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:56,213
No! We didn't say we thought
anything of the kind!

298
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,836
That's right. You didn't.

299
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,803
You're just doing this as a favor
to the rest of the town.

300
00:23:02,804 --> 00:23:06,473
- We <i>can add two and two together.
- Congratulations, banker.</i>

301
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:08,678
No deal.

302
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,139
You're making a mistake.

303
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,182
You'll never know, banker...

304
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,732
unless I have come for you.

305
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:35,288
<i>- How about that coffee?
- Yes, sir. Comin' right up, Mr. Gant.</i>

306
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,461
- Thad! Thad!
- I knew it wouldn't do any good!

307
00:23:38,462 --> 00:23:42,009
- We've got to figure some other way.
- There is no other way!

308
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,005
Thad!

309
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,716
- Mr. Pierce, I-
- Shut up!

310
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:50,893
I don't want to see anyone.
Understand? Anyone!

311
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,026
- Hi, Doc.
- Hi.

312
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,624
- Afternoon, Doc.
- Hello, Ben.

313
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,921
- How's your boy?
- Seems much better today.

314
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:06,759
- How'd that new vein pan out?
- Oh, vein's fine.

315
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,133
It's not the vein that's worryin' me.
Anything happen in town?

316
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,385
- Such as?
- Gant.

317
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,809
No. Think something's
going to happen?

318
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,973
Don't you?

319
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,897
Milly's inside.

320
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,992
Ben, I just saw Stricker and Pierce.
They were talkin' with John Gant!

321
00:25:33,993 --> 00:25:36,369
- Where?
- In the Soledad. They were real chummy.

322
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,837
Look, I think Charley's
down in the shaft. Go get him.

323
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,877
We've got some talkin' to do.

324
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,628
He's doing fine, Mrs. Chaffee.

325
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,805
This little Indian'll be out catching lizards
in a couple of clays if you keep him in bed.

326
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:54,260
- But I hate it in bed!
- Oh?

327
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,183
You wait till you grow up.
You'll change your tune.

328
00:25:57,184 --> 00:26:00,185
Just keep forcing these down his throat.
He's about back to normal.

329
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:03,438
I know by tomorrow
I'll have to strap him in bed.

330
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:07,899
- All right, young man.
- Ma, I hate those awful big pills.

331
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,370
No need my coming here again. Bring him
in the office next time you're in town.

332
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:14,365
Thank you, Doctor.
Come on, honey. Sit up.

333
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,787
We can't stand still for it.

334
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,754
If they get me out of the way,
you don't think you'll be safe!

335
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:26,464
There's one thing to do:
Beat Gant to the punch.

336
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:28,461
- Looks that way.
- Hiya, Doc.

337
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,931
- Hello, Hugo. Charley.
- How's the boy?

338
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:33,091
He's gonna be fine.

339
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,469
Doc, when you were talkin'
with Gant yesterday...

340
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,471
did he tell you anything?

341
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,976
Buck Hastings asked me the same thing.
Gant isn't very talkative.

342
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:45,648
Earl Stricker and Thad Pierce
hired Gant... to kill me.

343
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:46,743
I doubt that, Ben.

344
00:26:46,768 --> 00:26:50,026
Yeah? Then how come they were
meetin' with him this morning?

345
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:51,122
Hugo saw them.

346
00:26:51,147 --> 00:26:54,405
<i>I</i> was talking with Gant yesterday,
and <i>I</i> certainly didn't bring him here.

347
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:57,704
That's different. Stricker and Pierce
have every reason for wantin' me dead.

348
00:26:57,705 --> 00:26:59,700
Everybody knows it.

349
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,702
Now, I ain't a troublemaker...

350
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,424
but I'm not standin' by and do nothin'
with Gant fixin' to kill me.

351
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:09,710
Ben, I wouldn't do anything rash.

352
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,590
Why don't you leave it up to
Buck Hastings? He's a good man.

353
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:15,636
Sure, he is. But I don't
think he can handle Gant.

354
00:27:15,637 --> 00:27:16,890
I don't think anybody can.

355
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:20,265
There isn't much sense in trying
anything on your own, is there?

356
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:25,270
Well, maybe I can't handle Gant, but Stricker
and Pierce are somethin' else again.

357
00:27:25,271 --> 00:27:26,428
What do you mean?

358
00:27:26,453 --> 00:27:29,900
We're not lettin' those
crooks take over the mine.

359
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:32,775
And you can tell Stricker I said so!

360
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,237
That ain't just talk, Luke.

361
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,206
Come on.

362
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:50,882
You're lyin'. You're a-lyin'
just as sure as you're sittin' there.

363
00:27:50,883 --> 00:27:54,046
- You're lyin' in your teeth.
- What teeth?

364
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,553
Well, you're lyin', anyhow.

365
00:27:55,578 --> 00:27:58,678
Why, I see'd it myself,
right outside of Veracruz.

366
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,557
Just one teeny little shot,
and the Eighth Illinois "et" dirt.

367
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,147
There you go, lyin' again.
Ed, you're just a natural born liar.

368
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:07,571
It's a habit with you.

369
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:10,740
Oh, I got you now. You
can't prove a thing!

370
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:14,025
Why, you simple-minded,
flea-bitten old coot!

371
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,621
If you weren't so old, I'd-I'd-

372
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,869
Hey, sonny. Would you mind
movin' aside a little bit?

373
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,747
You're cuttin' out the sun.

374
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,629
Now, let's see.
What was we talkin' about?

375
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:38,341
Well, by George, I forget.

376
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,683
So do I, but whatever it was,
you was lyin' about it.

377
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:44,306
Come on. Let's go
pitch some horseshoes.

378
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:15,050
Dad, what do you do when you run up against
a disease that you're not equipped to cure?

379
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:17,296
What are you gettin' at?

380
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,966
I went out to
Chaffee's mine today.

381
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,892
I think Ben is gonna try and kill
Earl Stricker and Thad Pierce.

382
00:29:23,893 --> 00:29:26,889
He thinks they hired Gant
to kill him.

383
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,392
Buck Hastings is scared.
I know he is.

384
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,108
I hear that Thad Pierce
has locked himself in his office.

385
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:35,779
And Henry Reeger is wearin' a gun. It's
the first time I ever saw him with one.

386
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,942
Everybody you talk to is jumpy.

387
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:41,197
What causes a thing like that?
The whole town is comin' apart.

388
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:45,533
I shouldn't have to tell you
what fear does to people.

389
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,118
Fear, that's one thing.

390
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,794
A man's a fool not to be careful
around a rabid dog or a wolf...

391
00:29:50,795 --> 00:29:54,041
but he's more foolish
if he panics.

392
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,836
Well, it's gotta stop.

393
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,431
Only I don't know exactly
what it is that has to stop.

394
00:29:59,432 --> 00:30:02,049
Let it develop. Wait and see.

395
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,473
I wouldn't let a cold develop
into pneumonia if I could help it.

396
00:30:04,474 --> 00:30:08,690
Why not? You can't cure a cold,
but sometimes you can cure pneumonia.

397
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:10,730
You'd make a fine doctor.

398
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,109
Where you goin'?

399
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,783
Gonna play a game of chess.

400
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:31,662
Look at him.
The way he just sits there.

401
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,874
- Who does he think he is?
- Shut up, Lou.

402
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,924
I'll shut up when I'm ready.

403
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,465
I've about had it.
I'm tired of running!

404
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,140
I told you Sam would catch up
with us someday.

405
00:30:45,141 --> 00:30:47,595
Then why didn't he come himself?

406
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,896
I'll tell you why.
Because I'd kill him, and he knew it!

407
00:30:50,897 --> 00:30:54,691
Sure, you would.
He was just scared to death of you!

408
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,855
He was a hundred times
the man you are.

409
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,575
Yeah? If you think so much of him,
Why'd you leave him?

410
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:04,570
I wish I knew.
I-I keep wondering.

411
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,539
You keep wondering!

412
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,914
That stupid sawbones!

413
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,838
What's the matter with him?

414
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:22,723
I'm not gonna just sit back
and wait. That's for sure.

415
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:24,715
Lou Fraden don't eat crow.

416
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,511
No, Lou Fraden just runs
and runs and runs-

417
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,140
You think I'm afraid to go out there
and call him down, don't you?

418
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:33,365
Just because I've been
clerkin' for Stricker,

419
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,106
you think I forgot
how to be a man?

420
00:31:35,107 --> 00:31:37,150
You never knew how
to begin with.

421
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:40,147
Anyway, Gant doesn't want you.

422
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,149
Yeah? I know better.

423
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:47,530
No. Sam wouldn't dirty his hands
with you or me, either one.

424
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,876
Lou, you're not
even worth killing.

425
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,496
Go ahead, Lou. Be brave.

426
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,340
Go on.

427
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,429
Hmm.

428
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,772
Mr. Gant, why have you
come to Lordsburg?

429
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:20,363
Physician, I didn't ask you how
many tonsils you removed today.

430
00:32:20,364 --> 00:32:22,440
Well, you're welcome to.

431
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,275
It doesn't interest me.

432
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,944
You've been here
less than 24 hours.

433
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,813
Do you realize what your coming
here has done to this town?

434
00:32:29,838 --> 00:32:30,912
I've done nothing.

435
00:32:30,913 --> 00:32:33,911
But you've got to admit
that as the only doctor in town...

436
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:37,790
I have a certain interest in what we
might call “the municipal state of health."

437
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,588
Did it ever occur to you that
you might be wasting your life?

438
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:42,877
I'm not wasting my life.

439
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:46,889
They're gonna die anyway. Best you can
do is drag out their miserable lives.

440
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:48,226
Why bother?

441
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:51,427
Death is inevitable
for all of us, Gant.

442
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,477
But we all try to put it off
for as long as possible.

443
00:32:56,308 --> 00:33:00,233
It's occurred to me that the real
sicknesses, the most important ones...

444
00:33:00,234 --> 00:33:02,146
are seldom physical.

445
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,117
I think I've had more experience
with those than you have.

446
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,992
Well, you sound more
like a preacher than-

447
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,574
Than a killer, Physician?

448
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,953
I don't know.

449
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,377
You think you've got a mission?

450
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,972
Yes. I try to keep people alive.

451
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,392
I've got a mission too.

452
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:40,315
I don't suppose you know why
he's locked himself in his office all day.

453
00:33:40,316 --> 00:33:42,688
He's afraid of me.

454
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,941
Should he be?

455
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:51,243
I know nothing about the man,
except that he's a coward and a thief.

456
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:53,197
That's ridiculous.

457
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,242
Thad Pierce has done
a lot for this town.

458
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,541
Who'd he steal from?

459
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,749
I don't know...

460
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,877
but he is a thief.

461
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,891
Hmm. You play
a very interesting game.

462
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:21,484
I think you'd better get over
to the bank, Physician.

463
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,819
It's Mr. Pierce. He shot himself.

464
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,956
Wilson, what's goin' on in there?

465
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:48,633
It's awful, Mr. Stricker. The doc's
tryin' to keep him alive, but... his head.

466
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,343
It was because of Gant, wasn't it?

467
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,814
- What makes you think that?
- Couldn't be anything else.

468
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:02,391
He thought Gant was after him.

469
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,519
Poor Thad.

470
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,103
Doesn't make any difference.

471
00:35:07,128 --> 00:35:10,801
No matter who Gant came after,
we gotta do something about it.

472
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,285
I can't feel his pulse any more.

473
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,995
He's dead. I couldn't stop it.

474
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:26,216
It's a miracle you kept him alive
as long as you did, Doc.

475
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,211
How can they do it?

476
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,757
How can they throw
this thing away?

477
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:38,638
The whole world struggles to live,
and some men kill themselves.

478
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,481
Or did he?

479
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,627
You were expecting it
to happen, weren't you?

480
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:15,297
- I wasn't surprised.
- You killed him.

481
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,299
You're wrong, Physician.

482
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,641
He started killing himself
long before I ever got here.

483
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:23,265
You've got it all figured out,
haven't ya?

484
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,608
You look at Gant,
and you say he's a murderer.

485
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:35,577
- Well?
- I've killed.

486
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,155
But the important point is,
who have I killed?

487
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,991
It doesn't make any difference.

488
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,202
My price is high.

489
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:49,123
The man who hires me
makes a considerable investment.

490
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:52,799
The death of a man without guilt is
seldom worth that much money to anyone.

491
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,093
You don't understand me,
do you, Physician?

492
00:36:58,094 --> 00:37:01,641
Are you trying to tell me
that the men you've killed deserved to die?

493
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,815
Let's say, uh, most of them.

494
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:12,648
Even if I admit that there are men who
have done things deserving punishment...

495
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:15,446
I wouldn't grant you
or anyone else the right to punish them!

496
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:17,410
That's up to the law.

497
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,113
Take two men.

498
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:24,118
Say they have robbed and lied
and have never paid.

499
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,121
A man whom one of them has robbed
comes to me and says...

500
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:29,621
“Kill that man
who has robbed me."

501
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,582
And I kill him.

502
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,587
The other man becomes ill and would die,
except for a physician...

503
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:39,131
who returns him to health-
to rob and lie again.

504
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,550
Who's the villain in this piece?

505
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,599
Me or the physician?

506
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:52,062
Don't look as though
you think I'm insane.

507
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:53,938
You think about it.

508
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,950
Stop tellin' me what you want me to do,
and tell me how to do it!

509
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,950
Now, what am I gonna
charge Gant with?

510
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,624
You know as well as all of us.
He's responsible for Thad killing himself.

511
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:13,169
And you're worried
he'll be coming after you next.

512
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,620
We're not asking you to jail him.
Just get him out of town.

513
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,172
Oh, sure, Henry, sure.

514
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:21,175
I'll tell him you haven't been
sleeping nights. That oughta do it.

515
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:23,175
He's got a cute answer
for everything.

516
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,260
Buck, we're through arguing.

517
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,265
It's up to you and your deputy
to handle this situation...

518
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:31,104
and if you can't do it, we've been
paying the wrong men long enough.

519
00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:33,816
Don't tempt me
to turn in my badge, Earl.

520
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:37,360
That idea's been running through my mind.
I'm not a bit proud of it.

521
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:40,209
Hal, it looks like you're
elected along with me.

522
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,487
Whatever you say.

523
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:44,822
- Let's go see how we make out.
- Buck.

524
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:50,000
Whatever you have to do, I'll see that the town
council backs you up and makes it official.

525
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:52,417
- Can I depend on that?
- Yeah.

526
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,751
Well, that gives me an idea. Thanks.

527
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,784
<i>Mr. Gant, I'm Sheriff Hastings.</i>

528
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,755
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave town.

529
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,748
Why should I leave?

530
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:40,379
We've just put a law on the books
against a public nuisance.

531
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,346
Mr. Gant, you're a public nuisance.

532
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,268
Go away.

533
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,190
If you won't leave of your own accord,
then I'm gonna have to-

534
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,563
Why didn't you kill me?

535
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,783
I wasn't paid to.

536
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,323
Let's put this on.

537
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,702
All right.

538
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,998
There you are, Buck.

539
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:21,171
- You'll be as sound as a dollar in a few weeks.
- Sure.

540
00:40:21,172 --> 00:40:24,594
Even now it won't interfere
with your work, if you're careful.

541
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:27,809
Oh, I'm always careful.
Didn't you know that?

542
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,054
Well, Luke, what do we do now?

543
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,181
We don't even have any law.

544
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,856
Of course we do.
What's a bad arm to you?

545
00:40:36,857 --> 00:40:41,229
Oh, no, it isn't the arm.
It's what it stands for.

546
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,528
Word gets around, you know?

547
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,954
- I understand, Hal.
- Buck, I'm sorry.

548
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,425
It's all right, son.
I don't blame you at all. I'll take it.

549
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,884
Buck's twice the gun I am.
I'm not gonna get myself killed!

550
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,805
I sure wish I could
hand my badge in that easily.

551
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,682
No, you don't, Buck.
We couldn't do without you.

552
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:20,310
No, Luke, I'm no good.
I can't help you.

553
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,688
The law can go only so far.

554
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:26,487
But you know, in a way I ought to
be kind of glad about this.

555
00:41:26,488 --> 00:41:28,530
It means he didn't
come here for me.

556
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:31,575
- Maybe he didn't come here for anyone.
- Maybe not.

557
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:34,413
- Men are startin' to die anyway.
- 1 know it.

558
00:41:34,414 --> 00:41:38,630
He could be as innocent as a baby, but the
things that are happening are still his fault.

559
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:42,249
You're right.
Well, it's out of my field, anyhow.

560
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,715
It's more your kind
of a problem than mine.

561
00:41:44,716 --> 00:41:48,557
The most useless man in town right now
is a man that's good with a gun.

562
00:41:48,558 --> 00:41:51,591
I can't tell you
or anyone else what to do.

563
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,845
All I can tell you
is that my way isn't good enough.

564
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,812
If we're gonna get rid of Gant
and stop these killings...

565
00:41:57,813 --> 00:42:00,731
we've just got to find
some other way, that's all.

566
00:42:00,732 --> 00:42:04,322
Oh, uh, thanks
for patching me up, Doc.

567
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,448
It's too bad about Buck.
He's a good sheriff.

568
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,539
We'll never find
another one like him.

569
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,036
But I wouldn't blame him
if he resigned.

570
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,208
And now you want
to know what to do.

571
00:42:21,209 --> 00:42:23,582
With Buck helpless,
we've got to do something.

572
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,667
Because if we don't-

573
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,342
Well, I've told you
the way things are in town.

574
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,473
I'm getting tired of coughing.

575
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,640
I'm sorry, Judge. I wish there
was something else I could do.

576
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:41,016
You've done all you can.

577
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:44,021
Luke, I haven't sat
on the bench in ten years.

578
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:48,194
The laws on the books may have changed,
but the law itself hasn't.

579
00:42:48,195 --> 00:42:50,239
Law is the manifest will
of the people...

580
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,944
the conscious rule
of the community.

581
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:57,663
And when the mechanics of law enforcement
break down, they must be re-established.

582
00:42:57,664 --> 00:43:01,161
- <i>Nobody would take</i> Buck's <i>job now.
- Of course not.</i>

583
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,415
<i>So it's up to
the citizens as a whole.</i>

584
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:06,759
- You mean vigilantes, Dad?
- That's mob rule. I don't like it.

585
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,129
It doesn't have to be.
It usually winds up that way.

586
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,132
Well, here's an alternative, I suppose.

587
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,134
What?

588
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:20,227
Make it easy for Gant to finish
what he came here for. He'd leave then.

589
00:43:20,228 --> 00:43:22,688
That's ridiculous.
He came here to kill.

590
00:43:22,689 --> 00:43:27,025
It would be one man's life against the life
of the town. Wouldn't it be worth it?

591
00:43:27,026 --> 00:43:29,740
Of course it wouldn't.
You're not serious.

592
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,236
What sort of a man is Gant?

593
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,613
I don't really know. Why?

594
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,574
Just curiosity.

595
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,579
I don't like that vigilante idea.
There's gotta be another way.

596
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,872
Well, if you find one,
let me know.

597
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,375
Luke, how-

598
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,920
- How long did you say I've got left?
- Dad!

599
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,219
I don't think
we ought to talk about it.

600
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,884
Let's be adult, Luke.
Anne knows all about it.

601
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,970
Well, anything can happen.

602
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,938
- It was about six months, wasn't it?
- Maybe, if you're careful.

603
00:44:03,939 --> 00:44:06,982
You're not thinking
of doing anything foolish?

604
00:44:06,983 --> 00:44:10,272
I quit doing foolish things long ago.

605
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:14,985
Judge, I'm sorry I worried you with this.
You forget about it.

606
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,654
It's a hard thing to forget.

607
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,448
I like this town.

608
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,993
Luke, I'm glad about you and Anne.

609
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,995
So am I, Judge.

610
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:28,216
You try those new compounds
and try and get some sleep, huh?

611
00:44:28,217 --> 00:44:30,175
I'll wake you for dinner.

612
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:51,021
All right,
what's on your mind, Henry?

613
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,363
I'm fed up with this guessing game
of who Gant's after.

614
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:57,736
Now that Hastings has bungled the job,
we've got to do something.

615
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,404
Got any ideas?

616
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,828
Some of your drivers are good men.
I've got a few friends.

617
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:05,999
We get everybody together,
Gant won't stand a chance.

618
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,496
Maybe, if everybody goes with us.

619
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,671
Mr. Reeger, you'd better come back. Lou Fraden's
getting himself liquored up for trouble.

620
00:45:11,672 --> 00:45:16,046
He says Gant's here after him, and he's
getting drunk enough to try to take him on.

621
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,051
You go on back, Sid.
We'll be over in a minute.

622
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:22,848
There's a good chance that Lou may be
right. I don't know much about him.

623
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:26,270
- Maybe Gant did come after him.
- Who'd pay good money to have him killed?

624
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:29,601
I said it was a small chance,
buy why interfere?

625
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:32,020
Suppose he does go against Gant.

626
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,444
He just might get lucky.

627
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:45,626
Lou. Lou, I want to talk to you.

628
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,332
Gant!

629
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,834
I'm through running.

630
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,304
I've taken all I'm gonna.

631
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,511
Sam Ellis never was a man.

632
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:07,184
He wasn't man enough
to keep his own wife!

633
00:46:07,185 --> 00:46:10,397
Now he ain't man enough to do
his own killin'. He's gotta send you!

634
00:46:10,398 --> 00:46:12,733
You'd better go away, little friend.

635
00:46:12,734 --> 00:46:17,108
<i>Sendin' a vulture like you
won't get him back. You tell him that!</i>

636
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,987
No, you can't tell him that.
You'll be dead.

637
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:25,490
- Lou, don't be a fool.
- Shut up, Doc!

638
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:30,161
If nobody else is man enough
to stop this murderer, I'll do it.

639
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,123
Why do you want
to kill me, friend?

640
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,923
You know why.

641
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,380
All right.

642
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:43,800
If you think you can do it,
go ahead and try.

643
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,270
Look at my hands.
They're on the table.

644
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:51,266
<i>You could beat me to the draw.</i>

645
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,736
<i>I couldn't possibly outdraw you.</i>

646
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,150
So go ahead and shoot.

647
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,862
I'll shoot.

648
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,831
You think I'm yellow.

649
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,713
Be a shame to waste
all that whiskey.

650
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,977
Go ahead. I thought
you wanted to kill me.

651
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,516
You want me to.

652
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,611
You want me to draw.

653
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,106
Oh, no.

654
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,734
Oh, no, you don't.

655
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:46,785
You want a chance at me.
You want to kill me!

656
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,743
Everybody, look. You see?

657
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:55,747
I didn't go for my gun!
He's got no excuse!

658
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,842
He can't kill me now!

659
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,848
Physician.

660
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,851
I'm sorry about your sheriff.
He had courage.

661
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,104
What you did wasn't necessary.

662
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:22,107
I wouldn't have done it
if it hadn't been.

663
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,827
<i>You're brewin' big trouble
for yourself.</i>

664
00:48:24,828 --> 00:48:27,612
Who from? Men like him?

665
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,614
Gant, I'm a healer.

666
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:33,284
I've devoted my life to it,
and I intend to continue.

667
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:38,132
Right now I've got one big public
health problem, and I'm looking at it.

668
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:45,255
I like you, Physician.
You're like me.

669
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,601
You and I may well be
the only two honest men in town.

670
00:48:48,602 --> 00:48:52,847
Don't compare us.
We've got nothing in common.

671
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,026
Everybody dies.

672
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:18,288
I didn't hear any shots.

673
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,838
Start packing.
We're leaving town.

674
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:25,253
Sam must hate us
even more than I thought.

675
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,755
He's gonna let us stay together.

676
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,299
Well, cheer up, Lou.

677
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,136
After all,
we got what we wanted:

678
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,265
each other.

679
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,570
<i>- I kinda wish it was official-like.
- Who's gonna make it official?</i>

680
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:48,907
<i>You want Hastings to help?
He's already tried.</i>

681
00:49:48,908 --> 00:49:51,368
<i>Maybe you want old Judge Benson
to give you his blessing?</i>

682
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:53,865
- Well?
- Gant's still sitting on the porch.

683
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,119
I ran into Asa,
and he's going after Luke.

684
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,828
Wants us to wait
until they get here.

685
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,164
We're not waiting for anybody.

686
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:04,381
We all know why we're here,
and we know what we've gotta do.

687
00:50:04,382 --> 00:50:06,466
I'd feel better with
Luke and Asa with us.

688
00:50:06,467 --> 00:50:09,090
There are enough of us
to handle Gant without them.

689
00:50:09,091 --> 00:50:12,425
- <i>He's only one</i> man.
<i>- That? right.</i>

690
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,645
He's only one man.

691
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,399
What are you doing here, Hastings?

692
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,646
Trying to keep you
from being a pack of fools.

693
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,901
You keep out of it, Buck.
We'll handle it our own way.

694
00:50:27,902 --> 00:50:31,867
With guns? I can tell you all you need to
know about goin' against him with a gun.

695
00:50:31,868 --> 00:50:34,489
- I think there's enough of us.
- I doubt it.

696
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,366
Buck, you got eyes.

697
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,496
You can't expect this town
to just sit back and let him have his way.

698
00:50:39,497 --> 00:50:42,372
The town?

699
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:45,502
Well, just what has the town
got to do with it?

700
00:50:45,503 --> 00:50:48,004
Some of you people have
been sold a bill of goods.

701
00:50:48,005 --> 00:50:51,007
Earl isn't worried about the town,
he's worried about his own skin.

702
00:50:51,008 --> 00:50:53,550
- Just take it easy.
- And Reeger!

703
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,555
He has his own reasons for bein' worried.
Ask him about 'em.

704
00:50:56,556 --> 00:50:59,977
If we let Gant go on,
we won't have any town to live in!

705
00:50:59,978 --> 00:51:02,853
Buck, maybe you're right,
but it don't cut ice.

706
00:51:02,854 --> 00:51:07,063
You can't do anything about it,
and it's up to the rest of us.

707
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,068
I don't like it much,
but what else can we do?

708
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:12,902
All right. We've talked enough.
Let's go.

709
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,077
Oh, listen to me!
A mob isn't the answer!

710
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,251
You couldn't wait, Earl.

711
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,254
- You're determined to get somebody killed.
- Only Gant.

712
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:34,259
We're gonna tell him either he gets on
his horse right now and gets out of town...

713
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,259
or we're gonna gun him down.

714
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,261
Who's gonna do the talkin'?
You, Earl?

715
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,515
Why not? You think
you can do any better?

716
00:51:40,516 --> 00:51:43,308
Well, maybe I can.
At least I can try.

717
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,481
- Asa will go with me. The rest of you wait here.
- No.

718
00:51:46,482 --> 00:51:48,033
We're stayin' right behind you.

719
00:51:48,058 --> 00:51:51,234
He'll listen better lookin' down
the muzzles of a dozen guns.

720
00:51:51,235 --> 00:51:54,073
There's time for that later,
if we have to.

721
00:51:54,074 --> 00:51:56,898
Give me a chance to try and
work it out without bloodshed.

722
00:51:56,923 --> 00:51:58,286
You'll have your chance.

723
00:51:58,287 --> 00:52:00,660
You can do all the talkin'
you want to.

724
00:52:00,661 --> 00:52:03,456
But when you fall flat on your face,
then we're gonna do it my way.

725
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:06,420
It's either that, or you can
stay out of it altogether.

726
00:52:06,421 --> 00:52:08,634
Gant won't dare
go against all of us.

727
00:52:08,635 --> 00:52:11,419
You're goin' with us?

728
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,388
- All right.
- Come on.

729
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,540
Gant?

730
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:59,175
You're an organizer
as well as a physician.

731
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,679
I've come to ask you to leave.

732
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,681
And you come alone and unafraid.

733
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:08,812
We're not gonna argue with you, Mr. Gant.
We ask you to leave quietly.

734
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,021
And if I don't?

735
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,775
I'm tryin' to stop violence, Gant,
not cause it.

736
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,655
I ask you to consider what
will happen if you refuse.

737
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,739
I've thought of it.

738
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,616
Ask him who he's after, Doc.

739
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,244
It doesn't make any difference
who he's after.

740
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,339
<i>We're not gonna sacrifice anyone.</i>

741
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:33,126
All right, Doc, you've talked enough.
Now we'll do it our way.

742
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,095
There are many of you!

743
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:40,174
Yes, you could kill me,
if you're willing enough.

744
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:44,351
But it's only fair to tell you first
that I'll kill you, Stricker...

745
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,730
and you, Dutch Henry...

746
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:54,444
the physician, his father...

747
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,945
and there might even be
time for you, storekeeper.

748
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:04,365
You surprise me, Physician.

749
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:08,291
<i>I didn't expect to see you
running with the pack.</i>

750
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,375
You've come against me once.

751
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,502
Now I warn you.

752
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,756
I'll stay here
until I'm ready to leave.

753
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:23,348
I use my gun for money,
and I don't like to work for nothing.

754
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:26,938
<i>But you trouble me again
and I may have to break my rule.</i>

755
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,651
That's my prescription, Physician.

756
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,612
You'd better have it filled.

757
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:03,718
You're not making any progress.
Keep working at it.

758
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:06,516
- I thought you were going into town.
- After you finish breakfast.

759
00:55:06,517 --> 00:55:11,140
You've only been at it an hour.
We still have the rest of the day.

760
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,143
Who's that?

761
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,994
It's Luke.

762
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,158
- Good morning, Anne.
- Hello.

763
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,036
- You all right?
- Why shouldn't I be?

764
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,208
We don't live
on the moon out here.

765
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:37,378
I know about what happened in town,
and I know that you were part of it.

766
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:40,967
Nothing came of it, honey,
so there's nothing to be excited about.

767
00:55:40,968 --> 00:55:43,091
- <i>Good morning, Judge.
- Good morning, Luke.</i>

768
00:55:43,092 --> 00:55:46,513
But Buck Hastings said that Gant
threatened to kill you.

769
00:55:46,514 --> 00:55:49,514
That's a foolish thing for Buck to say.
When was he here?

770
00:55:49,515 --> 00:55:52,353
He was sitting on the porch
waiting when I got up.

771
00:55:52,354 --> 00:55:56,022
- I don't think he had much sleep.
- Why did he bother you?

772
00:55:56,023 --> 00:56:00,398
He was hoping I could suggest
something to do about Gant. I couldn't.

773
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:04,241
I was with Buck until almost 2.00
this morning talking about the same thing.

774
00:56:04,242 --> 00:56:07,158
We couldn't come up
with any new answers either.

775
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:10,785
- Maybe we'd better go back to the old way.
- You tried that last night.

776
00:56:10,786 --> 00:56:15,458
No, last night Asa and I were angrier with
Stricker and Reeger than we were with Gant.

777
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:18,296
We were the ones who insisted
on trying to talk with him.

778
00:56:18,297 --> 00:56:20,463
Luke, please don't
get involved in this.

779
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:22,800
But I am involved in it.
We all are.

780
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:25,511
Can't sit back and have people afraid
to walk the streets.

781
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:28,226
- Would you like some coffee?
- Oh, fine.

782
00:56:28,227 --> 00:56:30,511
I'll heat it up.

783
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:34,223
Trouble is, I can't make
my mind accept that...

784
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,268
Gant is the vicious killer
I know him to be.

785
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:41,445
I've played chess with him. I've talked
to him. I found myself liking him.

786
00:56:41,446 --> 00:56:44,400
Viciousness in men, Luke, is inside.

787
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,736
- <i>Deep inside.
- But why?</i>

788
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:50,207
What caused it? I keep wanting to know
what makes him tick.

789
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:54,076
Well, it's usually a kind
of logical progression.

790
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,421
A youngster starts
running with a gang.

791
00:56:56,422 --> 00:57:00,333
Sooner or later they're killed off
or sent to prison...

792
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,501
until he's the only one left.

793
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:06,598
He's gotten away with killing
and he keeps going with it, alone.

794
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:09,258
Pretty soon
he's everybody's enemy.

795
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,430
He can't let himself
even like someone...

796
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:13,930
because someday
he might have to kill them.

797
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,140
By then there's no turning back.

798
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,688
Even if he wants to
throw his gun away, he can't...

799
00:57:18,689 --> 00:57:23,065
because he knows that just around the
bend there's someone that'll kill him.

800
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,862
A lot of that
could be just in his mind.

801
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,203
Maybe he can quit
and get away with it.

802
00:57:32,204 --> 00:57:36,917
Maybe this killer around the bend isn't there
at all and is just something he's afraid of.

803
00:57:36,918 --> 00:57:39,584
You're still wrestling with the idea that,
given half a chance...

804
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:41,958
you could talk him into
a different kind of life.

805
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,963
- I wish I <i>could.
- It wouldn't do any good, Luke.</i>

806
00:57:44,964 --> 00:57:47,213
A man can't escape his past.

807
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:49,215
Here we are.

808
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:53,308
Just the coffee, honey.
I've got some patients in the office.

809
00:57:53,309 --> 00:57:56,851
If you can wait till I hitch up the buggy,
we can go to town together.

810
00:57:56,852 --> 00:58:00,148
- I've got some shopping to do.
- All right, that's fine.

811
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,903
Look at it.
And don't argue with me, Jim Merts.

812
00:58:07,904 --> 00:58:10,199
That was cracked
when you sold it to me.

813
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,697
Then why didn't you say so then?

814
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,326
You can't hold me
responsible for-

815
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,503
- Here. Excuse me.
- Well!

816
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,707
About last night, Mr. Gant, I hope
you don't think that I had anything-

817
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,709
Some shaving soap, please.

818
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,633
Yes, sir.

819
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,633
Good morning, Miss Benson.

820
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,635
Good morning.

821
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,604
Excuse me.

822
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,811
You're a very lucky
young woman, Miss Benson.

823
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,315
I like the man
you're going to marry.

824
00:58:46,316 --> 00:58:48,399
I find him remarkable.

825
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,901
But he told me-
Well, last night-

826
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:55,364
I don't meet very many honest men.
I respect them when I do.

827
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,366
Mr. Gant.

828
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,414
Mr. Merts, would you
send this on over to the house?

829
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:03,461
- I should be getting back to Dad.
- Sure, Anne.

830
00:59:03,462 --> 00:59:05,585
Excuse me, Mr. Gant.

831
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,800
Miss Benson?

832
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,303
If I may, I'll walk with you.

833
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,523
If you like.

834
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,772
I understand
your father's an invalid.

835
00:59:23,773 --> 00:59:25,770
Yes.

836
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:28,945
I'm sorry to hear that.
Nothing serious, I hope.

837
00:59:28,946 --> 00:59:30,983
Well, I'm afraid so.

838
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:34,310
Luke's been treating him.
He's a wonderful doctor.

839
00:59:34,335 --> 00:59:35,615
I'm sure of it.

840
00:59:35,616 --> 00:59:39,116
- Your father's bedridden?
- No, not entirely.

841
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,619
But he is too weak
to leave the house.

842
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:46,082
- He's a judge, isn't he?
- He was once. Why?

843
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,334
Judges interest me.

844
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:51,337
They have the power
of life and death.

845
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,339
So do physicians.

846
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,844
Mr. Gant, who have you
come to see?

847
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,930
Perhaps anyone, Miss Benson.

848
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,599
I don't quite understand.

849
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,644
Everyone has enemies,
Miss Benson.

850
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,646
Everyone.

851
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:12,447
I'd rather go the rest of
the way myself, Mr. Gant. Good day.

852
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,914
Remember, it's Stricker we want.

853
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:30,795
If Gant or anybody else butts in,
do some shootin' and do it fast.

854
01:00:30,796 --> 01:00:33,798
- How about Buck Hastings?
- He won't be botherin' anybody.

855
01:00:33,799 --> 01:00:35,515
Come on. Let's go.

856
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:47,936
Dad, I'm home.

857
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,025
Secrets?

858
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,279
Not from you.

859
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:02,408
- What's the matter, honey?
- Nothing.

860
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,702
- It's funny.
- What is?

861
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,673
You'll never guess
who I was talking to today.

862
01:01:07,674 --> 01:01:10,457
Don't tell me
Luke has competition.

863
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,051
It was John Gant.

864
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,885
- What did he want with you?
- I don't know.

865
01:01:15,886 --> 01:01:18,972
He just walked up to me
in the store and started talking.

866
01:01:18,973 --> 01:01:21,686
Oh, Dad, you don't think
it's me he's after?

867
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:24,555
- No, no, no, of course not, but-
- Anne?

868
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,479
In here.

869
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,900
I saw you from my window
talking with John Gant.

870
01:01:30,901 --> 01:01:33,486
You too?
What's the matter with you men?

871
01:01:33,487 --> 01:01:36,984
I don't like it. I don't want you
to have anything to do with him.

872
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:39,575
You're being jealous,
Dr. Canfield. You actually are.

873
01:01:39,576 --> 01:01:43,576
Don't be silly. It's just that
it's dangerous to be around him.

874
01:01:43,577 --> 01:01:46,749
Somebody might decide to
take a shot at him any time.

875
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,371
Hello, Judge. How do you feel?

876
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,665
Fine.

877
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,667
Sit down.

878
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,545
All right.

879
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,549
Luke, I've been thinking.

880
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:05,095
- I know how to stop your man for good.
- You do?

881
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,598
No one's been able
to convict Gant of murder...

882
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,853
because he's always been
able to prove self-defense.

883
01:02:10,854 --> 01:02:13,442
He's never shot down
a man in cold blood.

884
01:02:13,443 --> 01:02:15,691
- That's my understanding.
- Yes.

885
01:02:15,692 --> 01:02:19,445
But suppose the man Gant
has come after, whoever he is...

886
01:02:19,446 --> 01:02:22,573
would be willing to die
to stop Gant for all time.

887
01:02:22,574 --> 01:02:25,115
I don't follow you.

888
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:28,336
Suppose his man this time
refuses to defend himself...

889
01:02:28,337 --> 01:02:32,373
would willingly sit there
and force Gant to commit murder.

890
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:34,375
That's a little farfetched, isn't it?

891
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:37,050
Nobody in his right mind
would let himself be murdered.

892
01:02:37,051 --> 01:02:39,546
No, I suppose not.

893
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:44,927
It would be a hard thing to do,
to give up even a moment of life.

894
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,930
Everybody wants to live.
Isn't that what you say?

895
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,399
- That's right.
- What are you doing?

896
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,358
Now look, Judge, I thought we agreed
there'd be no more smoking.

897
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,856
It was a bad bargain.
You got me in a weak moment.

898
01:02:55,857 --> 01:02:59,450
Judge, I won't take the responsi-

899
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,790
It's Chaffee. He's headed
for Stricker's place. I'll see you later.

900
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,304
Gabe! Frank! It's Chaffee!

901
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,273
Cover me.

902
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,882
Stop it, you crazy fools!
Stop it! Stop it!

903
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:06,851
Stop it!

904
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:18,562
Doc, guess Stricker-

905
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,648
Guess Stricker didn't
need Gant after all.

906
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,617
You're gonna be all right.

907
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,413
Earl's dead, Doc, and Frank's got hit.
He's inside.

908
01:04:27,414 --> 01:04:30,158
In a minute.
Get my bag off my horse.

909
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,683
Easy, Ben. Easy.

910
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:52,012
I knew this was gonna happen.

911
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,173
- I could have stopped it.
- It wasn't your fault, son.

912
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,605
No, it wasn't. It was Gant's.

913
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:05,110
You're a doctor, boy.
This is where you're needed most.

914
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,039
All right, Dad.
Bring him inside.

915
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:22,459
Make out my bill
and get my horse. I'm leaving.

916
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,679
Oh. Yes, sir!

917
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:40,871
What are you doing?

918
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:43,624
Just tidying up a little.

919
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:46,084
Why was the door closed?

920
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,253
I didn't realize they were.

921
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,297
I have to go out for a while.

922
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:53,175
You just came in
a little while ago.

923
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,646
Well, I forgot to go
to the dressmaker's. I won't be long.

924
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,876
Well, Miss Benson.

925
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,254
Where can I find John Gant?

926
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:34,299
Why, he's up in his room,
number seven.

927
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,270
But I wouldn't go up there
if I were you.

928
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,191
Who is it?

929
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:54,412
<i>Anne Benson.
I want to talk to you, Mr. Gant.</i>

930
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,173
I'm gonna kill you, Mr. Gant.

931
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,835
Would you mind telling me why?

932
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:12,840
Because I know now
that you've come to kill my father...

933
01:08:12,841 --> 01:08:15,841
and I'm not gonna let you do it.

934
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,516
Then you should have
loaded your gun.

935
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,772
- What was that?
- Anne Benson's up there.

936
01:08:24,773 --> 01:08:26,895
We'd better get
the doc over here.

937
01:08:26,896 --> 01:08:28,862
You stay here. I'll get him.

938
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,299
Mr. Gant, please,
I beg you, don't do it.

939
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,840
He hasn't long to live.

940
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,593
I'm sorry about that.

941
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:03,347
Oh, no, you're not.
You like to kill.

942
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:07,065
But it won't do any good. He's not
going to defend himself against you.

943
01:09:07,066 --> 01:09:10,026
He's going to make you murder him,
and they'll hang you!

944
01:09:10,027 --> 01:09:12,945
He told Luke that that was
the only way to stop you.

945
01:09:12,946 --> 01:09:15,400
Kill him, and you'll hang!

946
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,496
Then I'll have to do
something about that, won't I?

947
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:32,459
Luke.

948
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,428
Luke!

949
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:57,034
- My bill.
- Yes, sir.

950
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,219
Luke!

951
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,909
She's still up there,
but Gant left.

952
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:44,415
Anne?

953
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,459
Anne?

954
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,541
Anne!

955
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,178
Anne, it's Luke. What happened?

956
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:09,183
I'm all right. It's Dad!
He's gone after Dad!

957
01:11:09,184 --> 01:11:11,647
- Take it easy.
- No, it's true! He admitted it!

958
01:11:11,648 --> 01:11:14,111
Please, Luke, you've got
to stop him. Please!

959
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,155
Stay with her, Sid.

960
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:26,492
- What happened?
- Gant's after the judge. Is the buckboard hitched up?

961
01:11:26,493 --> 01:11:27,959
Yeah.

962
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:04,870
Mr. Gant?

963
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:10,081
Some of your former associates
back East send their regards.

964
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:14,793
So I see.

965
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,291
You're not afraid?

966
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:22,297
I've been dying for a long time.
Death's an old friend.

967
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:26,510
But some of your other
old friends are impatient.

968
01:12:26,511 --> 01:12:29,058
They always were.

969
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,940
What are they afraid of, Gant?

970
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:42,399
I didn't ask.

971
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,569
I know anyway.

972
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:50,041
No one knows the structure of an edifice
better than the architect.

973
01:12:50,042 --> 01:12:52,576
If I were to tell what I know...

974
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:56,913
it would send the governor
and the mayor...

975
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,833
and myself to jail.

976
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:03,134
The two of them would make
distinguished convicts.

977
01:13:03,135 --> 01:13:07,048
- Perhaps.
- But killing me won't silence me.

978
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,135
It'll all come out, anyway.

979
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:12,230
That's their problem.

980
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:16,850
Well, go ahead, Mr. Gant.

981
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,945
I don't intend to resist you.

982
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,859
Other men have warned me
that they wouldn't defend themselves...

983
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,952
but they all wound up trying.

984
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:30,163
You have a lovely daughter.

985
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,826
I found her
very pleasant company...

986
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,795
but I'm afraid
the feeling wasn't mutual.

987
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:41,166
What are you talking about?

988
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:44,717
I thought you might like
this little remembrance of her.

989
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:49,600
What did you do to her?

990
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:53,267
What did you do to her?

991
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,983
Gant, I'll-

992
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,729
Gant, I'll-

993
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,535
Gant, I'll kill you!

994
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,911
Gant, I'll-

995
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:44,906
I have no quarrel with you, Physician.
Stand aside.

996
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:53,163
Gant!

997
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:02,294
- Luke, are you all right?
- I'm all right.

998
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,701
Luke, he didn't shoot the judge.

999
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,714
A lot of people would
like to kill John Gant...

1000
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:56,470
but it took a healer with a hammer
to make it easy for them.

1001
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:03,734
<i>Gant.</i>

1002
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:08,772
I could take a look at that arm.

1003
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,821
<i>Don't worry about it, Physician.</i>

1004
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:14,495
Everything comes to a finish.
