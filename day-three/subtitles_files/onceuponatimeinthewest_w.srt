1
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:28,052
Hey!

2
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:29,554
If you want any tickets,

3
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:34,267
you'll have to go around to the front of...

4
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,103
Well, I suppose it'll be all right.

5
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:39,314
What the hell am I doing around here?

6
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:40,690
They walk in here and...

7
00:01:46,863 --> 00:01:49,240
Let's see. I hope I got...

8
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:51,409
Three?

9
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:08,718
That'll be $7...

10
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:15,975
...and 50 cents.

11
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,442
No.

12
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,202
Frank?

13
00:12:21,163 --> 00:12:22,998
Frank sent us.

14
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,546
Did you bring a horse for me?

15
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,096
Well, looks like we're...

16
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:40,766
Looks like we're shy one horse.

17
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:48,941
You brought two too many.

18
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:31,437
Hey, Pal

19
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,896
Look!

20
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:59,840
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.

21
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:14,897
Timmy.

22
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,492
Maureen, look.

23
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:51,952
What you doing there?
Go inside, quick, and get washed.

24
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:54,705
And don't touch the apple pie
or the roast.

25
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:58,333
Patrick's already left
for the station, huh?

26
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:00,294
He's getting ready, Pa.

27
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:02,629
-Damn it, Patrick!
-Coming, Pa.

28
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,343
Not bad, I'd say.

29
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:12,973
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?

30
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:16,852
But these are the same slices as usual.

31
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:22,733
Yeah, sure.

32
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:26,278
As usual.

33
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:30,365
Maureen.

34
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:38,040
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices
as big as a door if you want to.

35
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:40,959
You'll have beautiful new clothes

36
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:42,836
and you won't have to work no more.

37
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:46,882
We're going to get rich, Pa?

38
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,388
Who knows?

39
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:55,724
Patrick!

40
00:18:57,226 --> 00:18:58,393
Wait a minute!

41
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:02,564
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean them.

42
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,613
The train will come in

43
00:19:09,696 --> 00:19:11,532
and there won't be no one
to meet your mother.

44
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:15,077
Our mother died six years ago.

45
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:28,840
Go now, or you'll really be late.

46
00:19:32,886 --> 00:19:36,181
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How am I gonna recognize her?

47
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:38,392
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.

48
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:44,147
She's young and she's pretty
and she's a lady.

49
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:50,445
"For traveling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

50
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:57,661
"and the same straw hat
that I was wearing when we met."

51
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,925
I'm gonna get some fresh water
from the well.

52
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:16,972
Oh, Danny boy

53
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:21,226
The pipes, the pipes are calling

54
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:27,566
And down the mountain side

55
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,443
The summer's gone

56
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:33,864
And all the roses fall...

57
00:21:29,544 --> 00:21:31,588
Maureen!

58
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,843
What are we gonna do
with this one, Frank?

59
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,402
Now that you've called me by name...

60
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:42,631
I saw some mighty fine stock
down south.

61
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:44,299
Is that so?

62
00:25:44,883 --> 00:25:46,843
And the prices are good.

63
00:25:57,145 --> 00:25:59,648
-These your valises, ma'am?
-Yes.

64
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:01,900
-Come, Sarah.
-Bring them other two.

65
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:04,277
We'll tote them for you, ma'am.

66
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,218
Is that true? The sawmill needs hands?

67
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:31,137
-Was yesterday.
-Why didn't you tell your brother?

68
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:33,932
-Hiya, Gramps.
-Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

69
00:26:34,015 --> 00:26:36,393
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

70
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:41,564
Get the lead out of your asses,
you redskin warriors.

71
00:26:41,648 --> 00:26:43,858
I got a whole train to unload.

72
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:47,112
All right,
chuck down those feed sacks first.

73
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:49,656
Come on! Come on!

74
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:39,909
What's the name of the place
you wanted to go?

75
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:41,953
Sweetwater.

76
00:29:44,497 --> 00:29:46,207
Brett McBain's farm.

77
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:50,753
McBain? Yeah, sure.

78
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:53,256
That stubborn redheaded Irishman,

79
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:57,218
tilling sand for years way out there
in the middle of nowhere.

80
00:29:57,302 --> 00:29:59,095
Sweetwater!

81
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:01,139
Only a loony like him could call

82
00:30:01,222 --> 00:30:04,309
that stinking piece of desert
Sweetwater.

83
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:06,728
Sweetwater!

84
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:12,483
That's good! Sweetwater!

85
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:59,155
That's right. A little more to the right.

86
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:01,032
Higher. Higher.

87
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,494
Hold it there.

88
00:31:13,628 --> 00:31:16,881
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.

89
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:20,385
They caught up with us again,
eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

90
00:31:21,135 --> 00:31:23,263
Hey, slow down.
What's the matter with you? Slow down!

91
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:25,306
Hey, boys! Watch out!

92
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:28,601
Watch out down there!

93
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:29,727
Slow down!

94
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:38,838
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.

95
00:32:38,921 --> 00:32:41,215
Don't the train stop?

96
00:34:28,406 --> 00:34:30,825
What can I do for you, ma'am?

97
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:33,661
I would like some water,
if it's no trouble.

98
00:34:33,744 --> 00:34:34,912
Water?

99
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,332
Well, you see, that word
is poison around these parts

100
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:40,710
ever since the days of the great flood.

101
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:44,213
-You mean you never wash?
-We sure do!

102
00:34:44,297 --> 00:34:47,008
I'd like to use the same facilities
you people do.

103
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:48,634
You sure can.

104
00:34:48,718 --> 00:34:50,761
Just happen to have
a full tub in the back.

105
00:34:50,845 --> 00:34:52,138
And you're lucky.

106
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:54,140
Only three people
have used it this morning.

107
00:34:54,807 --> 00:34:57,727
Used it one at a time or all together?

108
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,735
I can tell you're accustomed
to fine living.

109
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:08,988
Bet you come from
one of those big eastern cities.

110
00:35:09,071 --> 00:35:11,449
-New Orleans.
-New Orleans!

111
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:13,701
-You've been there?
-No.

112
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:16,412
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.

113
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:18,748
You know, she...

114
00:36:59,932 --> 00:37:00,975
Jug.

115
00:39:06,892 --> 00:39:11,105
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

116
00:39:15,192 --> 00:39:18,237
Do you know how to blow music
from that?

117
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:40,301
Pick it up.

118
00:40:06,902 --> 00:40:07,286
You!

119
00:40:14,877 --> 00:40:17,004
You don't know how to play.

120
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,947
Try this one.

121
00:40:58,546 --> 00:40:59,547
Take it.

122
00:41:18,858 --> 00:41:20,234
Go on.

123
00:41:31,495 --> 00:41:32,913
Here.

124
00:42:13,996 --> 00:42:15,331
Bravo.

125
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,773
Cheyenne.

126
00:42:41,315 --> 00:42:43,067
We thought we'd never make it.

127
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,986
It's all right. You're right on time.

128
00:42:48,781 --> 00:42:50,783
To bury my escort.

129
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:55,079
If I'd waited for you, I'd be in jail by now.

130
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:13,263
Hey.

131
00:43:22,064 --> 00:43:23,649
The gun.

132
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,757
You interested in fashions, Harmonica?

133
00:43:55,472 --> 00:43:58,308
I saw three of these dusters
a short time ago.

134
00:43:58,392 --> 00:43:59,393
They were waiting for a train.

135
00:44:05,816 --> 00:44:09,069
Inside the dusters,
there were three men.

136
00:44:10,821 --> 00:44:12,197
So?

137
00:44:14,074 --> 00:44:17,286
Inside the men, there were three bullets.

138
00:44:28,547 --> 00:44:31,884
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

139
00:44:33,927 --> 00:44:35,554
For two reasons.

140
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,433
One, nobody around
these parts got the guts

141
00:44:39,516 --> 00:44:42,436
to wear those dusters
except Cheyenne's men.

142
00:44:43,228 --> 00:44:47,149
Two, Cheyenne's men don't get killed.

143
00:44:51,779 --> 00:44:52,946
That surprise you?

144
00:44:53,906 --> 00:44:54,990
Yeah.

145
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,455
Well, you know music.

146
00:45:02,164 --> 00:45:05,375
And you can count.
All the way up to two.

147
00:45:13,675 --> 00:45:16,386
All the way up to six, if I have to.

148
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:19,473
And maybe faster than you.

149
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:35,447
Yeah, go on.

150
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,783
Play, Harmonica.

151
00:45:38,408 --> 00:45:40,536
Play, so you can't bullshit.

152
00:45:42,246 --> 00:45:44,665
Only, watch those false notes.

153
00:45:53,882 --> 00:45:55,134
Like so?

154
00:46:09,898 --> 00:46:11,441
And so, this cousin of mine

155
00:46:11,525 --> 00:46:13,360
keeps writing me
to come on down to New Orleans.

156
00:46:13,443 --> 00:46:17,156
"Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money."

157
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,409
I don't think I'd get along in a big city.

158
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:22,953
It's too full of fast men
and loose women.

159
00:46:23,036 --> 00:46:25,539
Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.

160
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:30,878
Now, I'm too used to
a quiet, simple country life.

161
00:49:01,403 --> 00:49:03,280
He's Timmy.

162
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:05,449
Yes.

163
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,243
Dear God.

164
00:49:09,703 --> 00:49:11,705
On the day...

165
00:49:12,998 --> 00:49:16,168
On the very day of your wedding.

166
00:49:17,044 --> 00:49:18,337
Poor little miss.

167
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,840
Mrs...

168
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,344
Mrs. McBain.

169
00:49:25,427 --> 00:49:28,263
But we all... But we thought...

170
00:49:29,348 --> 00:49:30,849
I know.

171
00:49:30,932 --> 00:49:33,185
It was to be a surprise today.

172
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,356
Brett McBain and I were married.

173
00:49:37,731 --> 00:49:39,483
A month ago.

174
00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:42,235
In New Orleans.

175
00:49:58,877 --> 00:50:01,129
"I am the resurrection, and the life.

176
00:50:01,213 --> 00:50:04,841
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

177
00:50:04,925 --> 00:50:08,387
"Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die."

178
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:09,596
Amen.

179
00:50:25,362 --> 00:50:28,281
-Mr. Bennett!
-What's he doing here?

180
00:50:31,576 --> 00:50:34,371
I found this collar on a nail by the door.

181
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:42,129
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good as a signature.

182
00:50:42,212 --> 00:50:44,297
Cheyenne's hand.

183
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:49,678
-But why?
-Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.

184
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:52,305
We'll make them tell us
before we hang them.

185
00:50:53,765 --> 00:50:55,725
Let's get moving.

186
00:51:14,995 --> 00:51:16,246
Come on.

187
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:19,124
Let's go back to Flagstone.

188
00:51:22,169 --> 00:51:23,920
No, Sam.

189
00:51:25,505 --> 00:51:26,923
You go back.

190
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:30,927
You don't want to stay out here alone.

191
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:33,930
Why not?

192
00:51:34,347 --> 00:51:35,974
This is my home.

193
00:55:35,004 --> 00:55:36,840
You know, Wobbles,

194
00:55:38,842 --> 00:55:40,427
I'm kind of mad at you.

195
00:55:44,723 --> 00:55:46,766
Frank wasn't there.

196
00:55:48,268 --> 00:55:50,478
He sent three friends.

197
00:55:50,562 --> 00:55:53,273
I don't know nothing, I swear.

198
00:55:53,606 --> 00:55:57,986
I only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it.

199
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:01,448
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

200
00:56:01,614 --> 00:56:05,368
-I swear to you that I...
-'Cause he was at the McBains'.

201
00:56:05,952 --> 00:56:08,705
That's not true. Cheyenne did that job.

202
00:56:08,788 --> 00:56:11,583
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

203
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:14,043
That was always one of Frank's tricks.

204
00:56:14,127 --> 00:56:15,920
Faking evidence.

205
00:56:17,881 --> 00:56:19,340
I don't know.

206
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:20,967
I swear.

207
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:25,430
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

208
00:56:25,513 --> 00:56:27,974
I don't know nothing.

209
00:58:28,595 --> 00:58:30,013
Who's there?

210
01:01:02,415 --> 01:01:04,208
Did you make coffee?

211
01:01:08,046 --> 01:01:09,589
Make it.

212
01:01:17,513 --> 01:01:19,265
Didn't sleep a wink.

213
01:01:20,058 --> 01:01:24,479
A pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night.

214
01:01:27,106 --> 01:01:30,318
Yeah, but I left them
in the middle of the desert.

215
01:01:30,401 --> 01:01:32,612
If they're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

216
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:55,468
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

217
01:02:01,808 --> 01:02:05,645
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

218
01:02:07,688 --> 01:02:09,232
Idiots.

219
01:02:09,649 --> 01:02:11,484
What the hell?

220
01:02:11,692 --> 01:02:14,737
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

221
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,532
Be like killing a priest.

222
01:02:18,116 --> 01:02:20,535
A Catholic priest, that is.

223
01:02:21,285 --> 01:02:24,580
Yeah, the world is full of people
who hate Cheyenne.

224
01:02:40,138 --> 01:02:44,308
See, I ain't the mean bastard
people make out.

225
01:02:47,395 --> 01:02:52,692
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me,

226
01:02:54,986 --> 01:02:56,529
it fires me up.

227
01:02:58,573 --> 01:03:01,159
And a fired-up Cheyenne

228
01:03:03,327 --> 01:03:05,371
ain't a nice thing to see.

229
01:03:05,997 --> 01:03:08,207
Especially for a lady.

230
01:03:21,095 --> 01:03:24,056
But you're too smart to make him mad.

231
01:03:29,395 --> 01:03:33,733
So this here's where I was
supposed to do all the killing?

232
01:03:34,442 --> 01:03:35,735
Yeah.

233
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:40,740
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

234
01:03:46,579 --> 01:03:51,250
Now, if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me,

235
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:57,673
so they can hang this thing
around my neck,

236
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,093
I don't like it none.

237
01:04:02,345 --> 01:04:04,305
But I can understand it.

238
01:04:08,893 --> 01:04:12,688
What I don't understand is why.

239
01:04:14,398 --> 01:04:16,192
Neither do I.

240
01:04:20,613 --> 01:04:24,283
But I see you looked a lot for the why.

241
01:04:30,706 --> 01:04:32,083
Yeah.

242
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:38,547
What if there were
a whole heap of whys?

243
01:04:39,715 --> 01:04:42,718
Round. Yellow.

244
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,972
You know the kind.

245
01:04:46,973 --> 01:04:49,308
You rap them on a stone

246
01:04:50,393 --> 01:04:52,270
and they go "ding."

247
01:04:52,853 --> 01:04:54,188
Maybe.

248
01:04:56,774 --> 01:04:58,985
But I didn't find them.

249
01:05:04,865 --> 01:05:06,242
By the way,

250
01:05:07,326 --> 01:05:10,621
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

251
01:05:13,624 --> 01:05:15,459
He's somebody you'd remember.

252
01:05:17,545 --> 01:05:19,755
Instead of talking, he plays.

253
01:05:20,923 --> 01:05:23,801
And when he'd better play, he talks.

254
01:05:28,514 --> 01:05:31,934
You know, ma'am, when you've
killed four, it's easy to make it five.

255
01:05:35,771 --> 01:05:38,691
Sure. You're an expert.

256
01:05:43,654 --> 01:05:46,490
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

257
01:05:51,454 --> 01:05:53,748
Of course I have.

258
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:58,085
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money.

259
01:05:58,711 --> 01:06:01,839
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.

260
01:06:02,048 --> 01:06:03,799
And even call in your men.

261
01:06:03,883 --> 01:06:06,719
Well, no woman ever died from that.

262
01:06:07,219 --> 01:06:10,473
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

263
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:13,309
and I'll be exactly what I was before.

264
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:17,229
With just another filthy memory.

265
01:06:33,621 --> 01:06:35,915
You make good coffee, at least?

266
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,209
Not bad.

267
01:06:38,876 --> 01:06:40,461
Congratulations.

268
01:06:41,128 --> 01:06:44,632
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

269
01:06:44,924 --> 01:06:47,134
I only told you to scare them.

270
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:50,888
People scare better when they're dying.

271
01:06:51,597 --> 01:06:55,059
And can you tell me what good
was your stupid massacre?

272
01:06:56,268 --> 01:06:58,646
Now, a Mrs. McBain has turned up.

273
01:07:01,315 --> 01:07:04,652
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

274
01:07:04,944 --> 01:07:08,280
Let's say this is something
I didn't plan on.

275
01:07:08,864 --> 01:07:11,951
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

276
01:07:13,494 --> 01:07:15,162
You know that.

277
01:07:15,996 --> 01:07:20,042
I got on board in sight of the Atlantic,

278
01:07:20,459 --> 01:07:22,378
and before my eyes rot,

279
01:07:23,879 --> 01:07:28,050
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

280
01:07:29,802 --> 01:07:31,595
I know where you got on board.

281
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:34,306
I was there, too, remember?

282
01:07:39,186 --> 01:07:44,817
"To remove small obstacles
from the track," you said.

283
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,487
Well, there were a few.

284
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,536
But we traveled a long way,
just the same.

285
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:56,662
And fast.

286
01:07:57,371 --> 01:08:01,292
Even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast.

287
01:08:03,586 --> 01:08:06,964
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr. Morton.

288
01:08:07,256 --> 01:08:10,509
I knew you
when you were just barely limping.

289
01:08:13,137 --> 01:08:17,349
I watch that dry rot rise
a little more every day.

290
01:08:19,685 --> 01:08:22,396
Any normal man would
put a bullet in his brain.

291
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,609
But you, you just got a little more hasty.

292
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,695
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

293
01:08:29,778 --> 01:08:32,323
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

294
01:08:32,406 --> 01:08:33,782
A lot.

295
01:08:35,117 --> 01:08:38,704
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

296
01:08:40,331 --> 01:08:43,083
Now, you're keeping in the background.

297
01:08:45,085 --> 01:08:47,713
You'll end up giving orders.

298
01:08:49,381 --> 01:08:53,302
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

299
01:08:55,304 --> 01:08:58,766
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

300
01:08:59,683 --> 01:09:02,436
-Like a friend.
-Or like a partner.

301
01:09:13,113 --> 01:09:16,617
How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

302
01:09:19,787 --> 01:09:22,414
It's almost like holding a gun.

303
01:09:26,961 --> 01:09:29,922
Only much more powerful.

304
01:09:45,145 --> 01:09:49,024
You see, staying with you,

305
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:53,946
I'm beginning to think big, too.

306
01:09:56,949 --> 01:09:59,034
This McBain business

307
01:10:00,869 --> 01:10:02,955
has given me ideas.

308
01:10:09,336 --> 01:10:13,215
I'm sorry for you, Frank.
You're doing your best.

309
01:10:15,134 --> 01:10:17,678
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

310
01:10:20,639 --> 01:10:21,724
Why?

311
01:10:21,807 --> 01:10:27,479
Because there are many things
you'll never understand.

312
01:10:38,616 --> 01:10:40,159
This is one of them.

313
01:10:41,118 --> 01:10:44,872
You see, Frank,
there are many kinds of weapons.

314
01:10:45,497 --> 01:10:49,793
And the only one
that can stop that is this.

315
01:11:44,223 --> 01:11:47,142
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

316
01:11:49,728 --> 01:11:53,148
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr. Morton,

317
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,445
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems.

318
01:11:59,154 --> 01:12:02,741
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

319
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:08,414
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you.

320
01:12:08,789 --> 01:12:11,291
"From now on,
there are no more surprises."

321
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:14,169
And then you happen
to meet a man like this,

322
01:12:14,253 --> 01:12:15,838
who looked like a good man.

323
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:18,424
Clear eyes, strong hands.

324
01:12:18,799 --> 01:12:20,843
And he wants to marry you.

325
01:12:21,301 --> 01:12:23,095
Which doesn't happen often.

326
01:12:23,429 --> 01:12:26,515
And he says he's rich, too,
which doesn't hurt.

327
01:12:29,351 --> 01:12:32,646
So you think,
"The hell with New Orleans.

328
01:12:33,689 --> 01:12:36,066
"Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country.

329
01:12:37,776 --> 01:12:41,655
"I wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all.

330
01:12:42,489 --> 01:12:47,286
"Take care of a house.
Do something. What the hell?"

331
01:12:58,672 --> 01:13:01,175
Well, God rest your soul, Brett McBain.

332
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,054
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

333
01:13:21,153 --> 01:13:24,531
Still, I swear
he'd left money around someplace.

334
01:13:26,784 --> 01:13:29,077
If you can find it, you're welcome to it.

335
01:13:29,536 --> 01:13:31,955
Mrs. McBain goes back to civilization.

336
01:13:32,247 --> 01:13:35,459
Minus a husband
and plus a great future.

337
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,432
You deserve better.

338
01:13:52,935 --> 01:13:56,814
The last man who told me that
is buried out there.

339
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:08,992
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

340
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:15,332
She was the biggest whore in Alameda

341
01:14:15,415 --> 01:14:18,043
and the finest woman that ever lived.

342
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:23,215
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month,

343
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:26,760
he must have been a happy man.

344
01:14:37,688 --> 01:14:39,940
Hey! Hey!

345
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,568
Hey!

346
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,968
What do you want?

347
01:15:51,428 --> 01:15:52,512
Cheyenne's right.

348
01:15:52,596 --> 01:15:56,725
Once you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

349
01:16:10,989 --> 01:16:13,200
This isn't the time to leave.

350
01:17:15,554 --> 01:17:17,305
Give me some water.

351
01:17:26,898 --> 01:17:28,400
From the well.

352
01:17:30,318 --> 01:17:32,195
I like my water fresh.

353
01:18:59,658 --> 01:19:01,785
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

354
01:19:02,869 --> 01:19:05,497
A sound? Like what?

355
01:19:06,414 --> 01:19:07,749
Like that.

356
01:19:39,739 --> 01:19:43,869
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

357
01:20:17,777 --> 01:20:19,237
Morning, Mrs. McBain.

358
01:20:19,696 --> 01:20:22,240
-What brings you to town?
-Good morning.

359
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:25,368
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

360
01:20:25,452 --> 01:20:27,412
I remember very well.

361
01:20:27,787 --> 01:20:30,665
Is there something I can do for you?

362
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:33,251
Yes.

363
01:20:35,795 --> 01:20:38,924
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.

364
01:20:39,007 --> 01:20:42,010
Why is everybody hounding me
about this guy Frank?

365
01:20:42,093 --> 01:20:44,721
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

366
01:20:45,096 --> 01:20:48,850
I got my own worries,
and all I want is to be left in peace.

367
01:20:48,975 --> 01:20:52,479
Tell Frank I want to negotiate with him.
Personally.

368
01:21:47,242 --> 01:21:50,578
You were told
not to come here for any reason.

369
01:21:51,162 --> 01:21:54,708
Whatever business you have with Frank,
keep it far away from here.

370
01:21:54,791 --> 01:21:56,251
Yes, I know, Mr. Morton,

371
01:21:56,334 --> 01:21:58,169
but when I heard that woman say
she knew everything,

372
01:21:58,253 --> 01:22:00,630
I thought that the important thing
was for me to come over here

373
01:22:00,714 --> 01:22:01,923
right away and tell you about it.

374
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,050
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

375
01:22:04,467 --> 01:22:06,344
Sure, but you know
that I'm mighty careful, Frank.

376
01:22:07,178 --> 01:22:08,763
No one could have followed me.

377
01:22:09,472 --> 01:22:11,725
That's the first thing I learned,
working for you.

378
01:22:11,975 --> 01:22:14,436
To listen unseen and to watch unheard.

379
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:18,606
You should learn to live
as if you didn't exist.

380
01:22:19,316 --> 01:22:21,234
You've known me a long time, Frank.

381
01:22:21,318 --> 01:22:23,153
You know you can trust me.

382
01:22:23,236 --> 01:22:24,988
Wobbles.

383
01:22:29,576 --> 01:22:33,371
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

384
01:22:34,247 --> 01:22:37,292
The man can't even trust his own pants.

385
01:22:46,968 --> 01:22:48,553
Let's get out of here.

386
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:30,071
The end of the line.

387
01:24:32,991 --> 01:24:34,075
Yeah.

388
01:24:40,081 --> 01:24:41,541
Get him on board.

389
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,807
Tie him up.

390
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:32,842
Wait, Frank.

391
01:25:33,718 --> 01:25:35,136
I didn't...

392
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,013
So, nobody followed you?

393
01:25:37,597 --> 01:25:39,933
No. You gotta believe me.

394
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:43,436
So, this is the way I can trust you.

395
01:25:43,645 --> 01:25:46,439
I can explain. I didn't know that he...

396
01:25:47,565 --> 01:25:50,026
-Get out.
-No. No. No, Frank.

397
01:25:50,777 --> 01:25:52,362
Get out.

398
01:26:11,256 --> 01:26:13,466
Frank, wait!

399
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,782
I told you to keep quiet.

400
01:26:42,495 --> 01:26:44,956
Where are Logan and Jim?
They take care of the woman?

401
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:47,000
Someone took care of them.

402
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:49,711
We found them out at McBain's place.

403
01:26:50,086 --> 01:26:52,505
Stone dead. And the woman was gone.

404
01:26:53,548 --> 01:26:56,634
Your friends
have a high mortality rate, Frank.

405
01:27:08,187 --> 01:27:10,732
First three, then two.

406
01:27:23,077 --> 01:27:25,622
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

407
01:27:27,373 --> 01:27:30,460
And you're the one
who doesn't keep them.

408
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:33,838
What do you want?

409
01:27:35,048 --> 01:27:36,466
Who are you?

410
01:27:39,927 --> 01:27:41,387
Dave Jenkins.

411
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,148
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

412
01:27:53,358 --> 01:27:55,193
Calder Benson.

413
01:27:56,986 --> 01:27:59,530
What's your name? Benson's dead, too.

414
01:28:01,658 --> 01:28:03,618
You ought to know, Frank,
better than anyone.

415
01:28:03,701 --> 01:28:05,036
You killed him.

416
01:28:05,703 --> 01:28:06,913
Who are you?

417
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,374
-Who are you, you...
-Frank!

418
01:28:11,459 --> 01:28:12,960
The woman.

419
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:17,048
We're only losing time.

420
01:28:22,512 --> 01:28:23,888
All right.

421
01:28:24,222 --> 01:28:27,141
This time,
I'll take care of her personally.

422
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:29,811
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

423
01:28:34,899 --> 01:28:36,734
Keep him warm for me.

424
01:28:36,818 --> 01:28:39,404
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.

425
01:28:39,737 --> 01:28:43,616
Not in the mouth.
He's got to talk. And plenty.

426
01:28:49,247 --> 01:28:51,332
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

427
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:54,168
By the way, I want you to keep an eye
on that cripple all the time.

428
01:28:54,252 --> 01:28:55,586
-Understand?
-Sure, Frank.

429
01:30:28,721 --> 01:30:30,848
-See anyone?
-No.

430
01:30:50,952 --> 01:30:52,078
There he is.

431
01:33:36,283 --> 01:33:38,369
You only know how to shoot?

432
01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:42,164
Or do you know how to cut, too?

433
01:33:53,634 --> 01:33:54,719
Hey, you.

434
01:33:56,887 --> 01:33:58,723
Wait a minute.

435
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:02,101
Let's have a good look at you.

436
01:34:13,404 --> 01:34:16,157
Hey. Mr. Choo-Choo.

437
01:34:34,842 --> 01:34:36,719
It's easy to find you.

438
01:34:37,344 --> 01:34:38,345
Bastard.

439
01:34:38,429 --> 01:34:40,389
I don't have to kill you now.

440
01:34:40,473 --> 01:34:43,267
You leave a slime behind you
like a snail.

441
01:34:43,809 --> 01:34:46,854
Two beautiful shiny rails.

442
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:49,732
There's another bastard.

443
01:34:50,441 --> 01:34:53,611
And he's getting further away
every minute.

444
01:35:05,372 --> 01:35:06,540
There it is.

445
01:35:06,624 --> 01:35:08,084
Exactly what your husband ordered
from me.

446
01:35:08,167 --> 01:35:10,669
And seeing as how he paid cash
on the barrelhead,

447
01:35:10,753 --> 01:35:12,296
it all belongs to you.

448
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:15,633
Oak planks, beech, pine.

449
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:17,760
All first-grade lumber.

450
01:35:17,843 --> 01:35:20,554
And there's beams
and foundation pylons.

451
01:35:20,846 --> 01:35:24,934
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar,
and all these tools.

452
01:35:25,267 --> 01:35:27,353
Maybe he wanted
to enlarge the farmhouse.

453
01:35:27,436 --> 01:35:29,313
Enlarge the farmhouse?

454
01:35:29,855 --> 01:35:32,691
He could have built
at least eight of them.

455
01:35:32,775 --> 01:35:34,443
By the way, ma'am,

456
01:35:35,236 --> 01:35:38,322
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.

457
01:35:39,115 --> 01:35:42,618
Only it seems he forgot to tell me
what he wanted printed on it.

458
01:35:50,376 --> 01:35:51,794
Station.

459
01:35:53,462 --> 01:35:54,463
How's that again?

460
01:35:54,964 --> 01:35:56,841
I said print "station."

461
01:36:29,331 --> 01:36:30,958
Looking for this?

462
01:36:31,709 --> 01:36:34,378
I've had enough of your butcher tactics.

463
01:36:34,461 --> 01:36:36,380
I know that woman is here.

464
01:36:36,881 --> 01:36:39,508
I don't want any more useless killing.

465
01:36:40,593 --> 01:36:42,928
I'm ready to make a deal for that land.

466
01:36:43,012 --> 01:36:44,972
To pay what's necessary.

467
01:36:45,055 --> 01:36:47,558
I don't want to waste any more time.

468
01:36:48,267 --> 01:36:50,728
You've made a big mistake, Morton.

469
01:36:54,982 --> 01:36:59,320
When you're not on that train,
you look like a turtle out of its shell.

470
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:01,238
Just funny.

471
01:37:01,864 --> 01:37:03,115
Poor cripple talking big

472
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:05,868
so nobody will know
how scared you are.

473
01:37:06,285 --> 01:37:07,870
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

474
01:37:10,789 --> 01:37:12,583
I don't have time to compete with you.

475
01:37:19,089 --> 01:37:20,299
Compete?

476
01:37:24,386 --> 01:37:26,055
Why, you...

477
01:37:26,138 --> 01:37:29,391
You can't even stand
on your own feet by yourself.

478
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:42,780
Is that sufficient
to make you feel stronger?

479
01:37:43,614 --> 01:37:46,242
I could squash you like a wormy apple.

480
01:37:48,702 --> 01:37:51,747
Sure, but you won't do it.

481
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:56,126
Because it's not to your advantage.

482
01:38:03,259 --> 01:38:06,303
Who knows how far you'd have gone
with two good legs.

483
01:38:14,561 --> 01:38:17,731
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.

484
01:38:20,609 --> 01:38:23,570
Morton. Don't worry about the land.

485
01:38:23,654 --> 01:38:25,572
If you feel like paying for it, you can pay.

486
01:38:25,656 --> 01:38:27,491
Of course, it won't make
any difference to you

487
01:38:27,574 --> 01:38:29,660
dealing with the new owner.

488
01:38:56,353 --> 01:38:58,897
Cheyenne! Hey, Cheyenne!

489
01:38:59,732 --> 01:39:02,276
There's a square staked out here.
It says "water tank."

490
01:39:02,985 --> 01:39:06,405
Over here, too.
Only, it says "post office."

491
01:39:06,989 --> 01:39:08,699
And this one says "corral."

492
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:11,785
And this here "church."

493
01:39:12,494 --> 01:39:14,246
What the hell is this?

494
01:39:14,705 --> 01:39:16,040
Can't you see?

495
01:39:17,207 --> 01:39:18,751
It's a station.

496
01:39:20,127 --> 01:39:22,171
And all around it, a town.

497
01:39:25,007 --> 01:39:26,759
Brett McBain's town.

498
01:39:29,219 --> 01:39:31,388
Was he crazy!

499
01:39:32,681 --> 01:39:34,975
Yeah, in a very special way.

500
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,936
An Irishman.

501
01:39:39,938 --> 01:39:40,981
He knew, sooner or later,

502
01:39:41,065 --> 01:39:44,360
that railroad coming through Flagstone
would continue on west.

503
01:39:44,443 --> 01:39:47,279
So he looked over
all this country out here

504
01:39:48,364 --> 01:39:51,033
until he found this hunk of desert.

505
01:39:51,116 --> 01:39:53,243
Nobody wanted it.

506
01:39:57,247 --> 01:39:58,540
But he bought it.

507
01:40:01,293 --> 01:40:05,839
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

508
01:40:07,549 --> 01:40:09,134
Waited for what?

509
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:13,180
For the railroad to reach this point.

510
01:40:14,056 --> 01:40:16,266
But how in the hell could he be sure

511
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:19,269
the railroad would pass
through his property?

512
01:40:20,604 --> 01:40:23,524
Them steam engines
can't roll without water.

513
01:40:23,982 --> 01:40:28,612
And the only water for 50 miles
west of Flagstone is right here.

514
01:40:29,196 --> 01:40:30,781
Under this land.

515
01:40:31,448 --> 01:40:34,326
He was no fool, our dead friend, huh?

516
01:40:35,077 --> 01:40:39,623
He was going to sell this piece of desert
for its weight in gold, wasn't he?

517
01:40:40,207 --> 01:40:43,168
You don't sell the dream of a lifetime.

518
01:40:44,628 --> 01:40:47,131
Brett McBain wanted his station.

519
01:40:49,758 --> 01:40:51,969
He got the rights to build it.

520
01:40:54,138 --> 01:40:56,890
-How do you know all this?
-I saw a document.

521
01:40:56,974 --> 01:41:00,269
It was all in order.
Seals, signatures, everything.

522
01:41:01,311 --> 01:41:02,729
One thing, though.

523
01:41:02,813 --> 01:41:06,984
In very small print,
there is a short clause,

524
01:41:07,818 --> 01:41:11,572
which says that McBain or his heirs
lose all rights

525
01:41:11,655 --> 01:41:14,783
if, by the time
the railroad reaches this point,

526
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,328
the station ain't built yet.

527
01:41:25,335 --> 01:41:29,423
Speaking of railroads,
I noticed the rail gang's already...

528
01:41:30,174 --> 01:41:31,717
Hey.

529
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:36,722
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills.

530
01:41:36,805 --> 01:41:41,226
And before you know it,
they're gonna be here.

531
01:41:41,685 --> 01:41:42,811
Yeah.

532
01:41:43,479 --> 01:41:44,563
Yeah.

533
01:41:46,023 --> 01:41:47,191
Listen.

534
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:49,485
Harmonica.

535
01:41:50,527 --> 01:41:53,739
A town built around the railroad.

536
01:41:54,990 --> 01:41:57,201
You could make a fortune, huh?

537
01:41:58,869 --> 01:42:01,288
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

538
01:42:02,706 --> 01:42:04,458
Hey, more than that.

539
01:42:05,918 --> 01:42:07,836
Thousands of thousands.

540
01:42:09,213 --> 01:42:11,215
They call them millions.

541
01:42:13,008 --> 01:42:14,259
Millions?

542
01:42:17,763 --> 01:42:20,140
-Yeah, millions.
-Yeah.

543
01:42:20,224 --> 01:42:24,478
I always thought it'd be easier
to make a deal with a smart lady.

544
01:42:25,145 --> 01:42:27,022
All you gotta do is...

545
01:42:29,775 --> 01:42:33,153
Hey, what in the hell
are you standing around for?

546
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:35,822
But, chief, what are we supposed to do?

547
01:42:35,906 --> 01:42:37,991
What are you supposed to do?

548
01:42:38,075 --> 01:42:40,744
Build a station, idiots!

549
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:46,542
I figure it ain't gonna look like much.

550
01:42:49,586 --> 01:42:53,507
But it'll be the first thing she sees
when she gets back.

551
01:42:54,758 --> 01:42:56,385
If she gets back.

552
01:44:16,548 --> 01:44:17,883
I think...

553
01:44:26,558 --> 01:44:27,684
Yeah.

554
01:44:28,894 --> 01:44:33,023
I'm beginning to think
I might be a little sorry killing you.

555
01:44:35,525 --> 01:44:37,319
You like being alive.

556
01:44:51,124 --> 01:44:54,294
You also like to feel
a man's hands all over you.

557
01:44:56,296 --> 01:44:57,714
You like it.

558
01:45:02,135 --> 01:45:05,931
Even if they're the hands of the man
who killed your husband.

559
01:45:25,992 --> 01:45:27,244
What a...

560
01:45:30,872 --> 01:45:32,624
What a little tramp.

561
01:45:35,752 --> 01:45:39,756
Is there anything in the world
you wouldn't do to save your skin?

562
01:45:43,427 --> 01:45:44,970
Nothing, Frank.

563
01:46:08,827 --> 01:46:11,788
Now I understand
why they miss you so much

564
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:17,210
down there in New Orleans.

565
01:46:19,838 --> 01:46:22,466
Great invention, the telegraph.

566
01:46:25,969 --> 01:46:28,722
“Jill? The brunette?

567
01:46:29,431 --> 01:46:31,057
"My God, all the customers

568
01:46:31,141 --> 01:46:33,727
"of the most elegant whorehouse
on Bourbon Street

569
01:46:33,810 --> 01:46:36,813
"have been weeping ever since she left."

570
01:46:39,274 --> 01:46:40,734
Say, tell me.

571
01:46:42,235 --> 01:46:43,987
Did old McBain know?

572
01:46:44,905 --> 01:46:45,989
Yeah.

573
01:46:47,491 --> 01:46:49,242
Yeah, I bet he did.

574
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:52,496
He was just the type to marry a whore.

575
01:46:55,832 --> 01:46:56,917
Hey.

576
01:46:58,668 --> 01:47:00,128
It's an idea.

577
01:47:02,547 --> 01:47:04,216
I could marry you.

578
01:47:05,675 --> 01:47:07,969
And the land would become mine.

579
01:47:08,804 --> 01:47:10,055
And maybe

580
01:47:12,933 --> 01:47:14,976
you'd make a perfect wife.

581
01:47:19,356 --> 01:47:23,068
It would be me who wouldn't be
any good as a husband.

582
01:47:24,444 --> 01:47:25,695
Too bad.

583
01:47:26,696 --> 01:47:29,407
We'll have to think of another solution.

584
01:47:29,825 --> 01:47:31,368
Simpler.

585
01:47:36,706 --> 01:47:37,958
Quicker.

586
01:48:00,105 --> 01:48:02,274
As sheriff of this county,

587
01:48:02,357 --> 01:48:05,777
I've been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

588
01:48:05,861 --> 01:48:10,407
of all property belonging
to Mrs. Jill McBain, here present.

589
01:48:10,866 --> 01:48:14,327
This parcel of land measures 320 acres.

590
01:48:14,411 --> 01:48:18,665
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

591
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:21,835
This property and all it contains,

592
01:48:21,918 --> 01:48:24,170
lock, stock and barrel,

593
01:48:24,254 --> 01:48:27,799
will be turned over to the lucky
purchaser at the time of sale.

594
01:48:27,883 --> 01:48:30,635
All the contents therein
are listed by number

595
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:33,638
on the inventory sheet
distributed among you.

596
01:48:33,722 --> 01:48:37,642
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

597
01:48:37,726 --> 01:48:39,269
All right. That's clear to everybody.

598
01:48:41,187 --> 01:48:42,856
I declare the auction open.

599
01:48:43,356 --> 01:48:45,984
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

600
01:48:50,614 --> 01:48:54,743
A list of all the items.
Some of them are worth money.

601
01:48:55,827 --> 01:48:59,456
All right.
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

602
01:49:03,418 --> 01:49:04,961
$200.

603
01:49:05,962 --> 01:49:08,465
Well, I have an opening bid of $200.

604
01:49:08,924 --> 01:49:12,385
$200. Do I hear more?

605
01:49:12,469 --> 01:49:15,221
That stinking piece of land ain't worth it.

606
01:49:15,305 --> 01:49:16,431
Is it, old-timer?

607
01:49:16,514 --> 01:49:19,559
Come on, my friends, $200.

608
01:49:20,101 --> 01:49:23,021
The livestock alone
is worth twice that much.

609
01:49:24,648 --> 01:49:25,815
Well...

610
01:49:27,025 --> 01:49:29,319
Who's going to bid $3007?

611
01:49:33,365 --> 01:49:35,075
Now, look, friends,

612
01:49:35,158 --> 01:49:38,328
I realize we're not offering
California here,

613
01:49:38,411 --> 01:49:41,665
but 200 is damn little
for all that property.

614
01:49:41,748 --> 01:49:45,835
Ladies and gentlemen,
I wouldn't even take 200 as a deposit.

615
01:49:49,172 --> 01:49:52,592
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.

616
01:50:00,934 --> 01:50:03,979
You're sure you wouldn't want
to set a minimum price?

617
01:50:06,106 --> 01:50:08,483
I wish I were wrong, Mrs. McBain,

618
01:50:08,566 --> 01:50:11,528
but you're liable to end up selling
the place for a plate of beans.

619
01:50:18,952 --> 01:50:20,996
All I want is to sell.

620
01:51:27,896 --> 01:51:30,648
-You look fat, huh?
-If you say so.

621
01:51:31,816 --> 01:51:33,610
-How many?
-One card.

622
01:51:36,154 --> 01:51:37,530
One for me.

623
01:51:40,450 --> 01:51:42,202
Dealer takes three.

624
01:51:52,796 --> 01:51:55,090
Can I... Can I take a hand?

625
01:52:01,638 --> 01:52:02,889
Fifteen.

626
01:52:16,277 --> 01:52:18,238
Yeah, sit down.

627
01:52:41,928 --> 01:52:43,263
I'll deal.

628
01:54:28,451 --> 01:54:29,911
How do you...

629
01:54:31,287 --> 01:54:33,998
How do you play this game, Mr. Morton?

630
01:54:36,709 --> 01:54:38,336
It's very simple.

631
01:54:39,671 --> 01:54:44,217
As long as you use your head,
you never lose.

632
01:54:45,093 --> 01:54:46,636
$500.

633
01:54:52,267 --> 01:54:53,685
$500.

634
01:54:55,853 --> 01:54:57,855
Do I hear any other bids?

635
01:55:00,275 --> 01:55:01,901
I don't think so.

636
01:55:11,244 --> 01:55:12,620
I'm sorry, Mrs. McBain,

637
01:55:12,704 --> 01:55:17,667
but I think I'm gonna have to
knock down on that last bid.

638
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:30,388
$500 once.

639
01:55:33,641 --> 01:55:35,852
$500 twice.

640
01:55:38,855 --> 01:55:41,316
-$500...
-$5,000.

641
01:56:05,214 --> 01:56:09,510
-You said $5,0007?
-It's on its way.

642
01:56:22,482 --> 01:56:24,317
It's Cheyenne!

643
01:56:34,077 --> 01:56:37,163
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that right?

644
01:56:37,580 --> 01:56:41,626
Judas was content with $4,970 less.

645
01:56:42,251 --> 01:56:44,754
There were no dollars in them days.

646
01:56:46,923 --> 01:56:49,258
But sons of bitches, yeah.

647
01:57:03,439 --> 01:57:05,525
Hey, wait a minute.

648
01:57:07,568 --> 01:57:10,405
-The jail's that way.
-Yeah, I know.

649
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:14,200
Yeah, but you're going
to the railroad station.

650
01:57:15,201 --> 01:57:17,787
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

651
01:57:17,870 --> 01:57:19,914
They got a modern jail there.

652
01:57:20,248 --> 01:57:24,627
It's got more walls, more bars,
more guards.

653
01:57:25,461 --> 01:57:29,298
You'll like it, in 20 years. You'll see.

654
01:58:30,693 --> 01:58:33,988
Two tickets, amigo, to the next station.

655
01:58:34,071 --> 01:58:35,531
One way only.

656
01:58:38,326 --> 01:58:41,162
Here's to you. And congratulations.

657
01:58:46,042 --> 01:58:48,252
You got yourself a good deal.

658
01:58:49,712 --> 01:58:51,088
The auction.

659
01:58:52,215 --> 01:58:55,635
Forget it. I don't invest in land.

660
01:58:58,262 --> 01:59:02,725
You don't look at all like the noble
defender of poor defenseless widows.

661
01:59:04,727 --> 01:59:06,229
But then again,

662
01:59:09,106 --> 01:59:12,235
I don't look like
a poor defenseless widow.

663
01:59:19,075 --> 01:59:21,285
Cheyenne's right.
You're a remarkable woman.

664
01:59:23,287 --> 01:59:25,373
And you're a remarkable man.

665
01:59:26,207 --> 01:59:28,751
But you have something on your mind.

666
01:59:34,507 --> 01:59:36,634
And you got something on your mind.

667
01:59:40,304 --> 01:59:44,267
Hot water. A bathtub full of hot water.

668
02:00:02,994 --> 02:00:05,705
I think it's time I filled that bathtub.

669
02:00:36,652 --> 02:00:37,862
Who are you?

670
02:00:59,467 --> 02:01:00,843
Jim Cooper.

671
02:01:01,844 --> 02:01:03,512
Chuck Youngblood.

672
02:01:04,513 --> 02:01:06,015
More dead men.

673
02:01:09,852 --> 02:01:12,855
They were all alive
until they met you, Frank.

674
02:01:19,111 --> 02:01:22,281
You paid $5,000 for something
that belongs to me.

675
02:01:27,495 --> 02:01:28,663
5,000.

676
02:01:33,793 --> 02:01:35,711
Plus one.

677
02:01:41,258 --> 02:01:43,469
You've got a right to make a profit, too.

678
02:02:10,579 --> 02:02:13,666
I wouldn't take too long thinking about I,
if I were you.

679
02:02:18,546 --> 02:02:20,840
You got yourself into something
that's bigger than you are.

680
02:02:20,923 --> 02:02:23,592
You got a chance to get out easy.
You better take it.

681
02:02:24,051 --> 02:02:26,762
You sound like
a real businessman, Frank.

682
02:02:27,596 --> 02:02:30,808
Being with Mr. Morton
has done you a lot of good.

683
02:02:38,357 --> 02:02:40,317
And you've learned some new methods.

684
02:02:42,653 --> 02:02:45,573
Yeah, Mr. Morton has shown you
a lot of new ways.

685
02:02:50,327 --> 02:02:52,955
Even though
you haven't given up the old ones.

686
02:02:54,206 --> 02:02:57,126
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.

687
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:01,589
Which deal, Frank?

688
02:03:04,717 --> 02:03:06,552
We have more than one, you and me.

689
02:03:10,389 --> 02:03:15,895
We can lump them together
into one bundle, settle all of them.

690
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:17,980
Here and now.

691
02:03:20,232 --> 02:03:21,984
Easy, Frank.

692
02:03:22,651 --> 02:03:23,778
Easy.

693
02:03:24,945 --> 02:03:27,114
You gotta learn not to push things.

694
02:03:27,364 --> 02:03:30,326
Taking it easy is the first thing
a businessman should do.

695
02:03:33,662 --> 02:03:37,333
I got an idea Mr. Morton
can teach you a lot more.

696
02:03:41,337 --> 02:03:42,630
How much?

697
02:03:44,006 --> 02:03:45,341
$1.

698
02:04:50,447 --> 02:04:52,074
Giddy up!

699
02:06:26,418 --> 02:06:27,836
Giddy up!

700
02:07:32,026 --> 02:07:34,695
I could swear we're going to have
that strange sound.

701
02:07:34,778 --> 02:07:36,113
Right now.

702
02:09:29,059 --> 02:09:30,477
Time sure flies.

703
02:09:32,271 --> 02:09:34,064
It's already past 12:00.

704
02:10:33,707 --> 02:10:36,084
But... But they were his men.

705
02:10:36,168 --> 02:10:38,587
-Yeah.
-And they tried to kill him.

706
02:10:39,046 --> 02:10:40,923
They must have found somebody
who pays better.

707
02:10:41,006 --> 02:10:42,049
And you!

708
02:10:42,466 --> 02:10:44,343
You saved his life.

709
02:10:46,970 --> 02:10:50,098
I didn't let them Kill him
and that's not the same thing.

710
02:11:02,945 --> 02:11:04,363
Sure.

711
02:11:04,947 --> 02:11:07,407
It's not the same thing.

712
02:11:14,748 --> 02:11:16,333
You get dressed.

713
02:11:16,750 --> 02:11:18,168
It's time to go home.

714
02:16:37,779 --> 02:16:39,531
Did you make coffee?

715
02:16:41,074 --> 02:16:42,659
This time I did.

716
02:17:23,158 --> 02:17:24,242
Good.

717
02:17:26,870 --> 02:17:29,998
My mother used to make
coffee this way.

718
02:17:30,832 --> 02:17:35,503
Hot, strong and good.

719
02:17:45,013 --> 02:17:46,681
Cheyenne.

720
02:17:48,892 --> 02:17:51,227
What's he waiting for out there?

721
02:17:53,855 --> 02:17:54,981
What's he doing?

722
02:18:00,987 --> 02:18:03,406
He's whittling on a piece of wood.

723
02:18:05,950 --> 02:18:08,662
I got a feeling when he stops whittling,

724
02:18:10,121 --> 02:18:12,123
something's gonna happen.

725
02:19:20,692 --> 02:19:22,694
Surprised to see me here?

726
02:19:24,821 --> 02:19:26,489
I knew you'd come.

727
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:53,183
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

728
02:19:54,517 --> 02:19:56,311
Now I understand why.

729
02:19:58,646 --> 02:20:02,984
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing
you were around somewhere alive.

730
02:20:04,152 --> 02:20:07,489
So you found out
you're not a businessman after all?

731
02:20:08,031 --> 02:20:09,199
Just a man.

732
02:20:11,868 --> 02:20:13,495
An ancient race.

733
02:20:19,876 --> 02:20:24,172
Other Mortons will be along
and they'll kill it off.

734
02:20:24,547 --> 02:20:26,508
The future don't matter to us.

735
02:20:27,383 --> 02:20:28,593
Nothing matters now.

736
02:20:28,676 --> 02:20:32,013
Not the land, not the money,
not the woman.

737
02:20:32,639 --> 02:20:34,516
I came here to see you.

738
02:20:37,101 --> 02:20:40,188
'Cause I know that now
you'll tell me what you're after.

739
02:20:55,495 --> 02:20:57,580
Only at the point of dying.

740
02:21:00,917 --> 02:21:02,126
I know.

741
02:21:46,796 --> 02:21:50,508
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

742
02:21:51,467 --> 02:21:53,595
Put it there, please.

743
02:21:56,014 --> 02:21:59,726
So I can watch the railroad move up
while I shave.

744
02:22:06,232 --> 02:22:07,609
You know what?

745
02:22:09,402 --> 02:22:12,071
If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

746
02:22:21,706 --> 02:22:23,333
You can't imagine

747
02:22:24,626 --> 02:22:27,795
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

748
02:22:30,256 --> 02:22:32,008
Just to look at her.

749
02:22:35,720 --> 02:22:38,973
And if one of them
should pat your behind,

750
02:22:41,017 --> 02:22:43,645
just make believe it's nothing.

751
02:22:46,606 --> 02:22:48,149
They earned it.

752
02:27:22,423 --> 02:27:24,759
Keep your loving brother happy.

753
02:30:43,707 --> 02:30:46,127
Who... Who are you?

754
02:31:53,903 --> 02:31:57,740
Hey. You're sort of a handsome man.

755
02:32:00,868 --> 02:32:02,912
But I'm not the right man.

756
02:32:15,799 --> 02:32:17,468
And neither is he.

757
02:32:20,304 --> 02:32:21,639
Maybe not.

758
02:32:22,223 --> 02:32:23,724
But it doesn't matter.

759
02:32:28,103 --> 02:32:30,231
You don't understand, Jill.

760
02:32:31,774 --> 02:32:34,735
People like that have something inside.

761
02:32:37,071 --> 02:32:39,365
Something to do with death.

762
02:32:42,743 --> 02:32:46,914
If that fella lives,
he'll come in through that door,

763
02:32:47,790 --> 02:32:50,084
pick up his gear and say adios.

764
02:32:55,839 --> 02:32:58,467
It would be nice to see this town grow.

765
02:34:30,517 --> 02:34:31,852
Now I gotta go.

766
02:35:18,148 --> 02:35:21,735
Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.

767
02:35:26,407 --> 02:35:28,742
I hope you'll come back someday.

768
02:35:46,510 --> 02:35:47,761
Someday.

769
02:36:00,149 --> 02:36:04,027
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

770
02:36:29,970 --> 02:36:32,014
Make believe it's nothing.

771
02:38:37,598 --> 02:38:39,266
Sorry, Harmonica.

772
02:38:39,808 --> 02:38:41,810
I gotta stay here.

773
02:39:20,390 --> 02:39:21,475
Who?

774
02:39:25,187 --> 02:39:27,189
I ran into Mr. Choo-Choo.

775
02:39:28,231 --> 02:39:31,652
I didn't count on
that half-man from the train.

776
02:39:32,486 --> 02:39:34,488
He got scared.

777
02:39:52,964 --> 02:39:54,508
Hey, Harmonica.

778
02:39:56,009 --> 02:39:57,761
When they do you in,

779
02:39:58,512 --> 02:40:01,014
pray it's somebody
who knows where to shoot.

780
02:40:16,863 --> 02:40:17,989
Go away.

781
02:40:21,034 --> 02:40:22,285
Go away.

782
02:40:22,994 --> 02:40:26,039
Go away. I don't want you to see me die.
