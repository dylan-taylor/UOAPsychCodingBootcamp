1
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:43,050
A hundred years ago

2
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:47,388
there were one and a half billion people on Earth.

3
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:54,312
Now, over six billion crowd our fragile planet.

4
00:00:55,772 --> 00:01:01,695
But even so, there are still places barely touched by humanity.

5
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:10,914
This series will take to the last wildernesses

6
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:14,084
and show you the planet and its wildlife

7
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:17,003
as you have never seen them before.

8
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:11,771
Imagine our world without sun.

9
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,653
Male Emperor Penguins are facing the nearest that exists on planet Earth -

10
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:21,323
winter in Antarctica.

11
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,869
It's continuously dark

12
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:30,165
and temperatures drop to minus seventy degrees centigrade.

13
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:44,057
The penguins stay when all other creatures have fled

14
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:46,726
because each guards a treasure:

15
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:50,021
A single egg rested on the top of its feet

16
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:54,109
and kept warm beneath the downy bulge of its stomach.

17
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,951
There is no food and no water for them,

18
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:05,662
and they will not see the sun again for four months.

19
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:10,751
Surely no greater ordeal is faced by any animal.

20
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,016
As the sun departs from the Antarctic

21
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:27,770
it lightens the skies in the far north.

22
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:37,906
It's March

23
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:41,160
and light returns to the high Arctic,

24
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:44,914
sweeping away four months of darkness.

25
00:03:57,928 --> 00:04:00,597
A polar bear stirs.

26
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:04,143
She has been in her den the whole winter.

27
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:08,690
Her emergence marks the beginning of spring.

28
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:13,820
After months of confinement underground

29
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:15,989
she toboggans down the slope.

30
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:18,242
Perhaps to clean her fur,

31
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,329
perhaps for sheer joy.

32
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:39,890
Her cubs gaze out of their bright new world

33
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:42,225
for the very first time.

34
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:46,438
The female calls them,

35
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:52,613
but this steep slope is not the easiest place to take your first steps.

36
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:07,461
But they are hungry

37
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:09,214
and eager to reach their mother,

38
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:12,884
who's delayed feeding them on this special day.

39
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:15,553
Now she lures them with the promise of milk,

40
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:18,974
the only food the cubs have known since they were born

41
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,979
deaf and blind beneath the snow some two months ago.

42
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:43,918
Their mother has not eaten for five months

43
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,880
and has lost half her body weight.

44
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:53,220
Now she converts the last of her fat reserves into milk for her cubs.

45
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:14,743
The spring sun brings warmth

46
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:17,789
but also a problem for the mother.

47
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:21,166
It starts to melt the sea ice.

48
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:25,463
That is where she hunts for the seal she needs to feed her cubs.

49
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:29,301
And she must get there before the ice breaks up.

50
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:36,475
For now though it's still minus thirty degrees

51
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,145
and the cubs must have the shelter of the den.

52
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:57,289
It's six days since the bears emerged

53
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:00,126
and spring is advancing rapidly.

54
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:04,046
But even now blizzards can strike without warning.

55
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,343
Being so small,

56
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:13,307
the cubs are easily chilled and they will be more comfortable resting in the den.

57
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:16,643
But their mother must keep them out and active.

58
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:19,855
She's becoming weak from hunger

59
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,067
and there's no food on these nursery slopes.

60
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,994
The sea ice still holds firm,

61
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,663
but it won't last much longer.

62
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:38,959
Day 10,

63
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,922
and the mother has led her cubs a mile from the den.

64
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,925
It's time to put them to the test.

65
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,181
They've grown enormously in confidence,

66
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:55,227
but they don't have their mother's sense of urgency.

67
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:14,415
At last it seems that they're ready for their journey

68
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,250
and they're only just in time,

69
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:21,088
for a few miles from the coast the ice is already splitting.

70
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:31,141
Now the mother can start hunting for the seals they must have,

71
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:35,938
but she's leading her cubs into a dangerous new world.

72
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:41,986
Nearly half of all cubs die in their first year out on the ice.

73
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:55,751
Summer brings 24 hours of sunlight

74
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:59,213
and the thawing shifting landscape.

75
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:07,347
Further south the winter snows have almost cleared from the Arctic tundra.

76
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:18,859
Northern Canada's wild frontier.

77
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:23,698
Here nature stages one of her greatest dramas -

78
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:37,797
Every year three million caribou migrate across the Arctic tundra.

79
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:57,110
The immensity of the herd can only be properly appreciated from the air.

80
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:10,248
Some herds travel over 2,000 miles a year in search of fresh pastures.

81
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:16,464
This is the longest overland migration made by any animal.

82
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:30,104
They're constantly on the move.

83
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:34,274
Newborn calves have to be up and running the day they are born.

84
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,136
But the vast herds do not travel alone.

85
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:04,099
Wolves.

86
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,398
Packs of them, eight to ten strong, shadow the migration.

87
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:14,735
And they are hungry.

88
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:24,621
It's the newly born calves that they are after.

89
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:36,467
Running directly at the herd is a ploy to generate panic.

90
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,563
The herd breaks up

91
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:52,526
and now it's easier to target an individual.

92
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:07,333
In the chaos a calf is separated from its mother.

93
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,259
The calf is young,

94
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:20,139
but it can outrun the wolf if only it manages to keep its footing.

95
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:35,782
At this stage the odds are even -

96
00:12:35,907 --> 00:12:38,076
either the caribou will make a mistake

97
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:41,329
or after a mile the wolf will give up.

98
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:32,759
Midsummer on the tundra

99
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:35,596
and the sun does not set.

100
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:42,437
At these latitudes the sun's rays are glancing

101
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,273
and not enough of their energy reaches the ground

102
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,984
to enable trees to grow.

103
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:53,616
You'll need to travel 500 miles south from here

104
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:55,617
before that is possible.

105
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:05,546
These stunted shrubs mark the tree line -

106
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:08,966
the beginning of the boreal forest -

107
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:10,342
the taiga.

108
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:23,857
The needle-shaped leaves of the conifers are virtually inedible

109
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:27,861
so this forest supports very little animal life.

110
00:14:34,536 --> 00:14:36,119
It's a silent place

111
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:40,082
where the snow is unmarked by footprints.

112
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,136
In the Arctic winter

113
00:14:51,262 --> 00:14:55,600
snow forms a continuous blanket across the land.

114
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,645
But as spring creeps up from the south

115
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,773
the taiga is unveiled.

116
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:10,324
This vast forest circling the globe

117
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:13,953
contains a third of all the trees on Earth

118
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,164
and produces so much oxygen

119
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:20,084
it changes the composition of the atmosphere.

120
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:24,381
As we travel south

121
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,634
so the sun's influence grows stronger

122
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:33,933
and at 50 degrees of latitude a radical transformation begins.

123
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:50,451
Summers here are long enough for broadleaf trees to replace conifers.

124
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,455
Broadleaves are much easier to eat and digest

125
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,791
so now animals can collect their share of the energy

126
00:15:57,918 --> 00:15:59,878
that has come from the sun.

127
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,381
It's summer

128
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:06,092
and these forests are bustling with life.

129
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:35,666
But the good times will not last.

130
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:42,049
Broad leaves must be shed in winter for their damage by frost.

131
00:16:42,174 --> 00:16:43,633
As they disappear,

132
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,722
so the land becomes barren with little for animals to eat.

133
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:59,484
The inhabitants must migrate,

134
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:00,902
hibernate,

135
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:04,281
or face months of near starvation.

136
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,759
The Amur leopard -

137
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:27,639
the rarest cat in the world.

138
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:33,855
Here, in the deciduous forests of eastern Russia

139
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,857
the winter makes hunting very difficult.

140
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:38,651
Pray animals are scarce,

141
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:41,696
and there's no concealing vegetation.

142
00:17:44,783 --> 00:17:48,787
The cub is a year old and still dependent on its mother.

143
00:17:57,297 --> 00:18:00,926
Deer are frequent casualties of the harsh winter

144
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:05,138
and these leopards are not above scavenging from a corpse.

145
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:09,185
African leopards could never survive here,

146
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:14,440
but the Russian cats have thick fur to shield them from the cold.

147
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:24,118
There are only forty Amur leopards left in the wild

148
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:26,286
and that number is falling.

149
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:29,414
Like so many creatures,

150
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,502
the cats have been pushed to the very edge of extinction

151
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:36,464
by hunting and the destruction of their habitat.

152
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:44,139
The Amur leopard symbolizes the fragility of our natural heritage.

153
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:48,977
The future of an entire species hangs on survival

154
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:53,108
of a tiny number of mothers like this one.

155
00:18:58,697 --> 00:19:01,074
All animals, rare or common,

156
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:05,204
ultimately depend for their energy on the sun.

157
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:15,798
In Japan the arrival of the cherry blossom

158
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:18,927
announces the beginning of spring.

159
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:44,747
The sun's energy brings color to the landscape.

160
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:58,344
The earth, as it makes its annual journey around the sun,

161
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:01,097
spins on a tilted axis.

162
00:20:01,223 --> 00:20:05,310
And it's this tilt that creates the seasons.

163
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,344
The advance of the seasons brings constant change.

164
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:39,305
As the sun's influence diminishes in the north,

165
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,019
so the deciduous forests of America begin to shut down

166
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:49,441
losing their leaves in preparation for the dark cold months ahead.

167
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:06,753
One season hands over to another.

168
00:21:06,878 --> 00:21:09,797
Some organisms thrive on decay,

169
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:13,551
but most must make special preparations for winter

170
00:21:13,677 --> 00:21:16,137
and a life with little sun.

171
00:21:31,362 --> 00:21:33,490
Whole populations of animals

172
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:39,872
are now forced to travel great distances in pursuit of food and warmth.

173
00:21:45,211 --> 00:21:51,425
300,000 Baikal teal gather to escape from the Siberian winter

174
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,138
by migrating south to Korea -

175
00:21:57,766 --> 00:22:02,312
the world's entire population in a single flock.

176
00:22:06,484 --> 00:22:11,072
But there are parts of the world that have no seasons.

177
00:22:14,408 --> 00:22:18,580
In the tropics the sun's rays strike the earth head on

178
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:23,294
and their strength is more or less constant all year round.

179
00:22:25,671 --> 00:22:28,507
That is why the jungle grows so vigorously

180
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:31,218
and supports so much life.

181
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:36,766
This forest covers only 3 percent of the planet's surface,

182
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:42,189
but it contains more than 50 percent of all its plants and animals.

183
00:22:45,776 --> 00:22:48,946
The canopy is particularly rich.

184
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,156
There are monkeys, birds

185
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:53,618
and millions of species of insects,

186
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:56,747
exactly how many we have no idea.

187
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:02,627
The character of the forest changes as we descend,

188
00:23:02,752 --> 00:23:05,298
becoming ever darker and damper,

189
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:09,218
favoring different kinds of animals and plants.

190
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,520
Less than 2 percent of the sunlight reaches the floor,

191
00:23:18,645 --> 00:23:22,442
but even here there is extraordinary variety.

192
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:33,704
In the great island of New Guinea

193
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,332
there are 42 different species of birds of paradise,

194
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,834
each more bizarre than the last.

195
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,908
This forest is so rich

196
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:12,370
that nourishing food can be gathered very quickly.

197
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:15,540
That leaves the male six-plumed bird of paradise

198
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:18,251
with time to concentrate on other matters

199
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:21,714
like tidying up his display area.

200
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:34,519
Everything must be spick and span.

201
00:24:42,653 --> 00:24:44,280
All is ready.

202
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:06,845
Very impressive,

203
00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:09,223
but no one is watching.

204
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,981
The superb bird of paradise calls to attract a female.

205
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,903
And he has more luck.

206
00:25:21,695 --> 00:25:26,033
But what does he have to do to really impress her?

207
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:55,107
She retires to consider her verdict.

208
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,117
It's hard not to feel deflated

209
00:26:04,242 --> 00:26:07,162
when even your best isn't good enough.

210
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:33,690
The sun influences life in the oceans just as it does on land.

211
00:27:20,783 --> 00:27:24,495
Its richest parts are those where waves and currents

212
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:27,832
bring fertilizing nutrients to surface waters

213
00:27:27,957 --> 00:27:29,960
that are bathed in sunlight.

214
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,673
The seas off the Cape in South Africa have this magic recipe

215
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:37,217
and are hugely productive.

216
00:27:41,055 --> 00:27:43,140
Summer is the time of plenty

217
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:46,978
and it's now that the seals start to breed.

218
00:28:11,714 --> 00:28:16,468
The strike of a great white shark lasts a mere second.

219
00:28:16,593 --> 00:28:20,473
Slowing it down forty times reveals the technique

220
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:24,268
and immense strength of this massive predator.

221
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,646
If surprise fails,

222
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:06,898
there will be a chase.

223
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:20,371
The shark is faster on a straight course

224
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:23,750
but it can't turn as sharply as the seal,

225
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:28,880
its agility versus power.

226
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:26,943
Once the seals have finished breeding

227
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:29,445
the giant sharks will move on.

228
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:33,576
It's now becoming clear

229
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:37,663
that great whites migrate thousands of miles across the oceans

230
00:30:37,788 --> 00:30:42,376
to harvest seasonal abundances in different seas.

231
00:31:09,322 --> 00:31:12,784
The sun, beating down on tropical waters,

232
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,745
powers the weather systems of the globe.

233
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:18,874
Moisture evaporates from the warming ocean

234
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:22,295
and rises to create great storms.

235
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,862
The winds generated out at sea

236
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,407
sweep inland across the continents.

237
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:03,464
As they travel across the Sahara

238
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:07,010
they create the biggest of all sand storms

239
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,387
blowing sand halfway round the world

240
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:12,683
to fertilize the Amazon jungle.

241
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:20,900
Winds blowing across the Indian Ocean

242
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:25,780
collect moisture and sweep northwards towards the Himalayas.

243
00:32:26,823 --> 00:32:30,160
As the air rises, so it cools.

244
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:36,125
The water it carries

245
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,377
condenses into clouds

246
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:43,174
and then falls as the life giving rains of the monsoon.

247
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:51,975
So air currents powered by the sun

248
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:55,813
carry wet air to the middle of continents.

249
00:33:15,251 --> 00:33:16,627
Without water

250
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,462
there can be no life,

251
00:33:18,587 --> 00:33:23,176
but its distribution over the land is far from even.

252
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:33,896
Deserts cover one third of the land's surface

253
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:36,941
and they're growing bigger every year.

254
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:51,707
This is the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa.

255
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:54,168
It's the dry season

256
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:57,172
and thousands of elephants have started to travel

257
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:59,966
in desperate search for water.

258
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:15,983
All across Southern Africa animals are journeying for the same reason.

259
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,531
Buffalo join the great trek.

260
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,201
Nowhere else on Earth are so many animals on the move

261
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:28,122
with the same urgent purpose.

262
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:36,505
They're all heading for the swamps of the Okavango,

263
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:39,175
a vast inland delta.

264
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,720
At the moment it is dry,

265
00:34:43,138 --> 00:34:45,264
but water is coming.

266
00:34:47,392 --> 00:34:52,439
The travelers are hampered by dangerous dust storms.

267
00:34:55,943 --> 00:35:00,573
Females and calves can easily get separated from the main herd.

268
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:22,013
For this pair sanctuary lies in the patch of woodland a few miles ahead.

269
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,808
They can't rest until they reach it.

270
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:44,746
The main has already got there safely.

271
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:54,132
Finally, the stragglers emerge from the dust.

272
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:03,475
The exhausted calf is still blinded by sand.

273
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:09,690
Its mother does everything possible to help it.

274
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:25,499
The storm is now subsiding,

275
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:29,002
but not all the elephants have been so lucky.

276
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,381
One youngster has got lost.

277
00:36:34,132 --> 00:36:36,176
Thirsty and exhausted,

278
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,847
it follows the tracks of its mother,

279
00:36:39,222 --> 00:36:42,893
but sadly in the wrong direction.

280
00:37:07,128 --> 00:37:10,047
At the peak of the dry season in the Kalahari

281
00:37:10,214 --> 00:37:13,217
water arrives in the Okavango.

282
00:37:13,301 --> 00:37:17,389
It fell as rain a thousand miles away in the highlands of Angola

283
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:21,059
and has taken nearly five months to reach here.

284
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:31,821
The water drives out insects from the parched ground,

285
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:34,324
which are snapped up by plovers.

286
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,038
Catfish, traveling with the flood,

287
00:37:40,163 --> 00:37:44,001
collect any drowning creatures the birds have missed.

288
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:59,392
It's a seasonal feast for animals of all kinds.

289
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:14,408
Birds are the first to arrive in any numbers -

290
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:16,411
wattled cranes,

291
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:20,206
then black storks.

292
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:25,296
Behind the birds come buffalo.

293
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:29,842
After weeks of marching their trek is coming to an end.

294
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:51,532
As the water sweeps into the Okavango

295
00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:58,331
a vast area of the Kalahari is transformed into a fertile paradise.

296
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:08,217
Nowhere on our planet is the life giving power of water so clearly demonstrated.

297
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:15,516
The Okavango becomes criss-crossed with trails

298
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:18,061
as animals move into its heart.

299
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:21,439
The new arrivals open up paths like arteries

300
00:39:21,523 --> 00:39:23,608
along which water flows,

301
00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:26,069
extending the reach of the flood.

302
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,636
This is an Africa rarely seen -

303
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:52,723
a lush water world.

304
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:13,496
Some creatures are completely at home here.

305
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:15,581
These are lechwe -

306
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:18,501
antelope with hooves that splay widely,

307
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:22,089
enabling them to move its speed through the water.

308
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:26,552
For others the change is far less welcome.

309
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:36,897
Baboons are somewhat apprehensive bathers.

310
00:41:09,307 --> 00:41:15,396
The water brings a season of plenty for all animals.

311
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:31,164
Hunting dogs.

312
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:55,023
These are now among the rarest of Africa's mammals,

313
00:41:55,148 --> 00:41:59,361
but then nonetheless the continent's most efficient predators.

314
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,449
Their secret is teamwork.

315
00:42:08,246 --> 00:42:11,248
Impala are their favorite prey.

316
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:13,626
They start to hunt

317
00:42:13,751 --> 00:42:15,879
and the pack splits up.

318
00:42:16,796 --> 00:42:21,093
An aerial viewpoint gives a new insight into their strategy.

319
00:42:22,136 --> 00:42:24,096
As the dogs approach their prey

320
00:42:24,221 --> 00:42:28,726
they peel off to take up separate positions around their target.

321
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:44,535
They seem to form a cordon around the impala.

322
00:42:53,461 --> 00:42:55,672
Moving in total silence

323
00:42:55,797 --> 00:42:57,925
they take up their positions.

324
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:06,058
Those ears can detect the slightest rustle.

325
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,668
The hunt is on.

326
00:43:33,588 --> 00:43:37,301
Three dogs close in on one impala.

327
00:43:46,143 --> 00:43:47,103
Missed.

328
00:43:51,524 --> 00:43:56,112
The lead dog drives the impala towards the hidden flankers.

329
00:44:06,248 --> 00:44:07,708
Anticipating their line

330
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:09,544
the leader cuts the corner

331
00:44:09,627 --> 00:44:12,714
and joins a flanker for the final assault.

332
00:44:15,008 --> 00:44:16,552
It's all or nothing.

333
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:18,094
One on one.

334
00:44:22,432 --> 00:44:23,892
The dog has stamina,

335
00:44:24,017 --> 00:44:26,437
the impala has speed.

336
00:44:40,285 --> 00:44:43,580
Leaping into the lake is an act of desperation -

337
00:44:43,705 --> 00:44:45,792
impala can barely swim.

338
00:44:49,629 --> 00:44:52,966
The dogs know their prey must come out or drown -

339
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:55,760
now it's a waiting game.

340
00:45:03,853 --> 00:45:06,313
The rest of the pack are calling.

341
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,776
They've made a kill in the forest

342
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:13,571
and this is an invitation to join in the meal.

343
00:45:17,326 --> 00:45:19,744
The impala is in luck.

344
00:45:27,754 --> 00:45:33,009
A pack this size kills once a day and everything is shared.

345
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:45,732
And this impala is reprieved.

346
00:45:54,282 --> 00:45:58,454
The elephants are nearing the end of their long journey.

347
00:46:00,414 --> 00:46:05,086
After weeks of marching they're desperately tired.

348
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,888
The matriarch can smell water

349
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:18,642
and encourages the herd to make one last effort.

350
00:46:29,195 --> 00:46:30,780
The youngsters are exhausted

351
00:46:30,864 --> 00:46:33,283
but their mothers have made this journey before

352
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:35,911
and they know that they're close to water.

353
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:57,935
After many hundreds of miles they've arrived.

354
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:14,768
The lives of these elephants are dominated by the annual rhythm of wet and dry,

355
00:48:14,852 --> 00:48:18,688
a seasonal cycle created by the sun.

356
00:48:49,556 --> 00:48:51,432
At the southern end of the earth,

357
00:48:51,516 --> 00:48:54,185
after four months of total darkness,

358
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:58,607
the sun once more rises over Antarctica.

359
00:49:12,623 --> 00:49:17,377
Now at last the Emperor penguins abandon their huddle.

360
00:49:17,461 --> 00:49:20,465
The males are still carrying the precious eggs

361
00:49:20,547 --> 00:49:24,344
that they've cherished throughout the Antarctic winter.

362
00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:36,231
With the returning sun the eggs hatch.

363
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:40,360
Other birds have not even arrived.

364
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:44,448
But the Emperors by enduring the long black winter

365
00:49:44,532 --> 00:49:48,286
have given their chicks a head start.

366
00:49:57,463 --> 00:50:05,180
These youngsters are now ready and eager to make the most of the brief Antarctic summer.
