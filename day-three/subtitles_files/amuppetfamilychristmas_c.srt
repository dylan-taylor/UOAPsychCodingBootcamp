1
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:08,319
 Haul out the holly 

2
00:00:08,587 --> 00:00:11,141
 we're headed home so we can 

3
00:00:11,623 --> 00:00:13,623
 start to celebrate. 

4
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:16,207
 Fill up the stockings 

5
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:18,830
 we may be rushing things but 

6
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:23,130
 we can hardly wait now. 

7
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:26,227
 For we need
a little Christmas 

8
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:28,006
 right this very minute 

9
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:29,942
 candles in the window 

10
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:31,561
 carols at the spinet. 

11
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,612
 Yes, we need
a little Christmas 

12
00:00:33,874 --> 00:00:35,480
 right this very minute. 

13
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:37,737
 It hasn't snowed
a single flurry 

14
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:39,586
 Fozzie, we're all in a hurry. 

15
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:43,141
Guys, this is the best
idea we've had in years.

16
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:45,307
Christmas at my mother's farm.

17
00:00:45,485 --> 00:00:48,263
Sounds great Fozzie, but don't you think we
should have called your mother.

18
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:49,669
To let her know we were coming?

19
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:52,254
Oh, how little you
understand bears Kermit.

20
00:00:52,491 --> 00:00:54,599
My mother loves surprises!

21
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,133
- Good thing. She's in for a beauty.
- Surprise, surprise!

22
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:02,106
You see, I know what she
is doing this very second.

23
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:05,652
There she is in the
old farmhouse

24
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:07,312
on the snowy hill,

25
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:11,114
nice and cozy by a roaring fire.

26
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,019
Oh, the Christmas
decorations will be up...

27
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:16,619
And ma will be in her
rocking chair, knitting...

28
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,121
And feeling just a little sad,

29
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:22,124
that she's all alone
for the holidays.

30
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:26,529
Well, the plane leaves for
California in three hours.

31
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:29,630
Ho-ho, Christmas in Malibu!

32
00:01:29,777 --> 00:01:34,329
Ah, I'm going to lie on the
beach and catch some rays.

33
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,636
Wocka, wocka!

34
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:38,638
Oh, this is going to
be such a surprise!

35
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,141
 Haul out the holly 

36
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:43,835
 turn on the
brightest string of 

37
00:01:44,162 --> 00:01:46,018
 lights we've ever seen. 

38
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:48,647
 Slice up the fruitcake 

39
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:51,505
 it's time we
hung some tinsel 

40
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:55,927
 on that evergreen bough. 

41
00:01:56,303 --> 00:01:58,864
 For we need a little music 

42
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:00,866
 need a little laughter. 

43
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:02,768
 Need a little singing 

44
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:04,409
 ringing through the rafter 

45
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,494
 and we need a little 

46
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:08,507
 slappy happy ever after. 

47
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:12,425
 We need... a... little 

48
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:16,283
 Christmas 

49
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:19,675
 now. 

50
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,180
Well, I think I have everything.

51
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:27,599
Yes, the airline ticket,
my suntan lotion, the...

52
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:29,432
Come in!

53
00:02:29,462 --> 00:02:31,996
Hello! Is this Grizzly Farm?

54
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:34,671
Oh, you must be the renter.
Come in, come in!

55
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:38,083
Yes, yes, I'm doc.
Are you my landlady?

56
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:43,208
No, Sprocket, I didn't know
I was renting from a bear.

57
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:44,646
Oh, mind your step!

58
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:46,677
Be careful. There's an
icy patch there. Oof!

59
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:52,448
I'm so glad there's someone going to be
staying in the house while I'm gone.

60
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:56,233
Yes, well, Sprocket and I...
He's my dog, Sprocket.

61
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:58,688
We're certainly delighted
to be renting the place.

62
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:02,225
We've been wanting to spend a nice,
quiet Christmas in the country.

63
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:04,736
You've come to the right place.

64
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,387
Put your things in the bedroom

65
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:08,280
- at the top of the stairs.
- Thank you.

66
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,750
Now who could that be?

67
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:16,058
Ta-da! Merry Christmas!

68
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:17,781
- Son!
- Mom!

69
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:19,462
Ahh!

70
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:24,499
- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- Well, what the... a surprise!

71
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,785
No, no, the real surprise is...

72
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,441
- I brought all my friends with me!
- What?

73
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,443
Come on, everybody!
Merry Christmas!

74
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,444
Be careful of the icy patch.

75
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:35,446
Yeah, that's terrific!

76
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,948
Yeah. Come on!

77
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:40,451
- Hey, aren't you glad to see us all?
- Whoa!

78
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:43,620
- Well, I should say.
- Excuse me, Mrs. Bear.

79
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:48,545
Remember me? I rented this place
to have a nice, quiet Christmas.

80
00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:51,047
Peace on earth! Give me present.

81
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:52,262
- Arf arf arf.
- Argh!

82
00:03:52,263 --> 00:03:56,140
Be careful, Sprocket. These could
be from some foreign planet.

83
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,471
Actually, they're
from television.

84
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:01,820
I recognized Fozzie's
weirdo friends.

85
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,377
Yeah. We're proud of it too.
Heh-heh-heh!

86
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:05,468
Why am I here?

87
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:08,471
Tell me, Sprocket are these anything
like these Fraggles...

88
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:10,144
You keep telling me about?

89
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:14,476
Come on, come on! Mom, I
want you to meet someone.

90
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:16,709
This is my boss, my friend,

91
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:18,480
- my inspiration,
- aw!

92
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:22,484
The one who gave me my big break
in the show business, Kermit.

93
00:04:22,777 --> 00:04:24,510
Oh, yeah, the lizard.

94
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:26,655
Uh, well, frog actually.

95
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:29,946
Listen, Mrs. Bear, I know there are an
awful lot of us here, so I just...

96
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:31,568
Don't you worry about it.

97
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:34,696
- There's plenty of room for everybody.
- Excuse me.

98
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,346
You promised me a nice,
quiet Christmas.

99
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:41,289
You think you're disappointed.

100
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,293
I just took three months of
surfing lessons for zip!

101
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:47,796
Telephone!

102
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:50,799
- Telephone!
- Uh, that's just animal.

103
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:54,920
- Hello, hello, hello! Give me present!
- Joyeux Noel, Kermie.

104
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:56,652
Oh, pig.

105
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,498
Uh...

106
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:03,042
Hello? Uh, piggy?

107
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:06,151
Kermie, my dear Cher, it's you!

108
00:05:06,152 --> 00:05:09,153
Yes, piggy, it's me. Hey,
listen, where are you?

109
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:10,813
You were supposed to come
to the farmhouse with us.

110
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:12,156
I know, Kermie,

111
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:17,161
but I forgot about a teensy-weensy
photo session I just scheduled.

112
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:20,163
Now give me more over the
shoulder, honey. Hold it.

113
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:24,668
- W-well, hurry up.
- Do not worry so, my little green hunk.

114
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,804
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Couldn't be nicer.

115
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:31,165
Thank you. My chauffeur Jerome
is ready to whisk me away...

116
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,991
Into your arms at the farmhouse. Ha-ha!

117
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:35,620
Oh, beautiful! Beautiful!

118
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:38,519
I must go now. I'm rather busy.
See you soon!

119
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,022
- Hmmph! Okay, bye.
- Kissy-kissy! Bye-bye!

120
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:45,128
- Oh! Oh, now do that pouty thing!
- Oh, yes.

121
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,631
Do that pouty thing! Oooh!
Oh, fabulous!

122
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:52,635
You'll find more
bedrooms up the stairs.

123
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:56,138
Those are our bedrooms!
We rented this place.

124
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,139
Not more!

125
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,141
Fozzie, get that door!

126
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,644
Okay, mom! Up the stairs.
Up the stairs.

127
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:05,648
- Swedish chef!
- Fleula yule!

128
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:07,163
Whoa!

129
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,810
Watch out for that icy patch there.

130
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:10,530
Ja.

131
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:14,400
Genghis fur her der
gobbla-gobbla-gobbla torkey.

132
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:17,212
You mean, you're here to cook the
Christmas Turkey for us.

133
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:18,125
Ja, ja!

134
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:21,160
Let's go to the kitchen.
♪ Gunghis bird der gunghaberg ♪

135
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:23,162
♪ La la la la la-la ♪

136
00:06:23,163 --> 00:06:25,037
♪ La la la la la-la la ♪

137
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,039
Now, where did my little
chickiepoo Camilla get to?

138
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,543
I'll get it! Ha-ha! Yes?

139
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:32,632
Hi there!

140
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,045
Oh! Y-you're a Turkey!

141
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:34,906
Of course.

142
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,547
Come on outside. We got to talk.

143
00:06:36,548 --> 00:06:38,293
Chicken in da cooking.

144
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:40,424
Sure, there are rats and chickens here.

145
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:42,052
We always have
rats and chickens.

146
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,985
You're in the wrong place
at the wrong time now.

147
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:47,488
Take a walk, fly south for the winter.
Anything!

148
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:50,560
I was invited for Christmas by
some guy who spoke Swedish.

149
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:50,950
Oh, brother.

150
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:53,459
Had a white chef's hat on.
Sounds like a nice vacation.

151
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,899
Mm-hmm. Listen, that guy is a chef.
Don't you realize...

152
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,902
It could be very dangerous
for turkeys around here?

153
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:02,997
Not to worry. I'm a survivor.
Now, where's my room?

154
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:05,514
If you're not careful,
it'll be in the oven.

155
00:07:05,515 --> 00:07:08,517
So long, Bucko. Heh-heh!

156
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,053
See you at dinner!

157
00:07:10,915 --> 00:07:13,066
What seems to be the
trouble, Fozzie?

158
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:16,049
Well, you see, Kermit, the chef is
a little bit angry...

159
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:18,876
Because of all the rats and
chickens in his kitchen.

160
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,378
How about we send them to his
bedroom instead?

161
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:25,424
Oh, ja, chicken en da rat in
the bunksa-bunksa.

162
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:28,283
All right, let's go. Come
on, head 'em out! Okay.

163
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:30,835
- Up to the bedroom. Up to the bedroom.
- Yes, here we go, guys.

164
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:36,165
Whew, another crisis solved. Boy,
there sure are a lot of us here.

165
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:39,149
Well, the whole family's
starting to come together.

166
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,998
We always come together
at Christmas.

167
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:45,154
Yeah. Life would just pass in a blur if
it weren't for times like this.

168
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:46,756
Hmm?

169
00:07:47,157 --> 00:07:50,660
 Jingle bells jingle bells 

170
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:54,162
 jingle all the way. 

171
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:57,508
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 

172
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:01,363
 in a one-horse open sleigh.

That's going to be a
terrific Christmas tree.

206
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:36,964
Just bring it inside, guys.
Thanks.

207
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:40,722
- Yo, Fozzie! I finally made it.
- Hey, Rowlf, welcome.

208
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:41,447
You're late.

209
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:43,394
I've been chasing a
truck all the way,

210
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:45,310
and boy, am I exhausted.

211
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:49,297
- I get it. Truck, exhaust. That's funny.
- Yeah, that's a dog joke.

212
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,728
- Go inside and tell mom that.
- Gotcha.

213
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:53,731
She loves canine humor.

214
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:58,407
Okay, boys, put it over
there in the corner.

215
00:09:58,408 --> 00:10:01,911
- Come on, doc, let's get this holly up here.
- Oh, Mrs. Bear!

216
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:04,914
I've been chasing a
truck, and boy... whoa!

217
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:09,417
Oh, my! I guess Fozzie didn't
tell you about the icy patch.

218
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:12,420
Yeah, I guess he didn't. Anyhow,
my name's Rowlf the dog.

219
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:15,923
- I've come for the holidays.
- More? More people?

220
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:18,425
I'll go out and see if there's

221
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:20,428
a spare pillow in the kennel.

222
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:22,272
Arf arf.

223

- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

345
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:02,932
Hark, what do I hear?

346
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:06,424
- You hear me about to make some Turkey hash.
- No, no, listen!

347
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:08,926
Methinks me hears carolers.

348
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:16,935
 Here we come a-caroling
among the leaves so green 

349
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:21,033
 here we come a-wandering
so fair to be seen 

350
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:23,111
 love and joy come to you 

351
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:25,291
 and to you glad tidings too 

352
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:29,589
 and god bless you and
send yo a happy new year 

353
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,565
 and god send you a
happy new year. 

354
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,148
It's the sesame street gang.

355
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:40,412
- Merry Christmas from sesame street!
- Merry Christmas!

Oh, that was fun. I love carols.

386
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:57,297
It's nice to have everyone here. You can
feel the peace of the holiday season.

387
00:17:57,298 --> 00:17:58,298
Wow!

388
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:02,474
Whoa! Whoa! Watch out.

389
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:04,527
Well, doc, you know
what this means.

390
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:08,160
Sprocket and I will have to give up
our hammock in the attic, right?

391
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:11,335
Either that or build bunk-beds
in the broom closet.

392
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,069
Sprocket, go get me
a hammer, will you?

393
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:17,448
- Hi there. Hey, we're Ernie and Bert.
- Yeah.

394
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:19,450
Well, hi there yourself.
I'm doc.

395
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:22,193
Did you know that "doc" starts
with the letter "D"?

396
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:23,509
Why, yes.

397
00:18:23,563 --> 00:18:26,064
- Yes. "Yes" starts with the letter "Y."
- Yeah.

398
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:29,153
- True.
- And "true" starts with the letter "T."

399
00:18:29,154 --> 00:18:30,064
What is this?

400
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:32,130
Where we come
from, this is small talk.

401
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:34,524
Whatever you say. It's
nice to meet you,

402
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:37,026
but I've got to go and
build some bunk-beds.

403
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:38,938
Bunk-beds! "B" words.

404
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:43,963
Hey, hey, hey, no, you got me wrong.
I-i-I'm a dairy cow. Moo!

405
00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:46,268
No, no, no, Du bis borgey.

406
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:48,270
All right, okay, I'm a IIII-I'm a...

407
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:50,476
I'm a birdie, I'm a birdie. I'm a
seagull, all right?

408
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:52,801
No, no, no. Gobbla-gobbla.

409
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:54,226
Okay, all right, I
admit it, I admit it!

410
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:55,563
The jig is up!

411
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,153
Here I am, the Christmas Turkey.

412
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:00,110
Ee-toscus nu!

413
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,239
Ow! Hey! Watch it
there, will ya?

414
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:08,308
Oh, yeah, yeah, I
recognize it now.

415
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:11,298
This is... thi... this is the
traditional fitting, right,

416
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:14,489
to see if the roasting pan is big
enough for the nice fat bird.

417
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,446
Ja, ja, ja, gobbla-gobbla
torkey fitsky witsky.

418
00:19:18,447 --> 00:19:20,695
Of course, uh, before
we go any further,

419
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:24,664
uh, there is one thing I
think you should see.

420
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:27,370
Numisbiscus
gobbla-gobbla snooze?

421
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:30,372
If you think I'm a nice
fat bird, look at this!

422
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,986
Oy, York!

423
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,980
Nushna gobbla-gobbla humonga!

424
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,349
Ain't it the truth.
Heh-heh-heh-heh! Mmm!

425
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,676
Hey, everyone, quiet down.
There's a bulletin on TV.

426
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,121
≡⌁ and now for this news flash. ⌁≡

427
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:50,340
≡⌁ the worst blizzard in 50 years is
approaching us at a great rate. ⌁≡

428
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:54,400
≡⌁ the weather service reports that
barometers are falling sharply. ⌁≡

429
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:56,676
≡⌁ oh, no! Aah! ⌁≡

430
00:19:57,178 --> 00:19:59,327
he's right! Look at the snow.

431
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:01,481
One snowflake, two snowflake,
three snowflake...

432
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:04,021
But miss piggy's out there in that storm.

433
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:05,833
Five, six...

434
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:17,349
All right, the huge canary sleeps
in the attic with the cookie eater.

435
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,224
Check.

436
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:21,165
The blue monster said
he'd sleep in the bathtub.

437
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,667
- Check.
- And, uh,

438
00:20:22,684 --> 00:20:25,186
Ernie and Bert will bunk
out with the lizard here.

439
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:27,581
Uh, frog. Kermit the frog.

440
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:28,925
What about Oscar?

441
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:32,076
I'll be nicely miserable
in my trash can here.

442
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:34,851
Hey, maybe I could bunk
out here with you.

443
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:38,819
I never had a rat in my trash can before.
That might be nice.

444
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:43,238
Hey, everybody, look what I've got...
Christmas cookies!

445
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:44,434
Cookie!

446
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,504
Oh, thank you.

447
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:54,825
Who was that strange
blue creature?

448
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,776
That my kind of fella.

449
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,508
Hey, everybody, it's time to rehearse
for our sesame street pageant.

450
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:05,650
It's called 'twas the
night before Christmas.

451
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,920
- Come on out, Bert.
- I won't.

452
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:10,696
- Come on, Bert.
- Ernie, please don't make me.

453
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:12,963
Oh Bert, listen,
everybody's waiting.

454
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,061
Ernie, why must you
always humiliate me?

455
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:23,777
Come on, somebody has to play mama.
And you lost the toss.

456
00:21:23,778 --> 00:21:26,164
- All right, well, just get it over with!
- Okay.

457
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:29,707
'Twas the night before
Christmas by clement Moore.

458
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:30,708
Hit it, Rowlf.

459
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:35,556
"'Twas the night
before Christmas..."

460
00:21:35,557 --> 00:21:38,864
"And all through the house not a creature
was stirring, not even a mouse."

461
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:39,602
Cue the mouse.

462
00:21:39,603 --> 00:21:41,301
I'm here! I'm here!

463
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,191
Cute little Grover mouse is here.

464
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:44,674
What's the bowl for?

465
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:47,927
Oh, uh, so you can see
that I am not stirring.

466
00:21:47,928 --> 00:21:51,431
Note how the hand never
touches the spoon.

467
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:53,799
Thank you, thank you.

468
00:21:54,152 --> 00:21:56,654
Thank you, public. Thank you.
This is great.

469
00:21:56,655 --> 00:21:58,853
Oh, aren't they adorable?

470
00:21:58,854 --> 00:22:01,112
Hey, don't encourage them.

471
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:03,318
"Mama in her kerchief...
" That's you, Bert.

472
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,142
I know, I know.

473
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:07,392
"And I in my cap had just settled
our brains for a long winter's nap.

474
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,465
"When out on the lawn there
arose such a clatter,

475
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:11,095
I sprang from my bed to
see what was the matter."

476
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,258
Open the curtain!

477
00:22:18,335 --> 00:22:20,278
Monsters as reindeer?

478
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,620
This is crazy!
Wh-where's Santa Claus?

479
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:24,377
Don't worry, Bert,
we're getting to him.

480
00:22:24,378 --> 00:22:26,542
"With a little old driver
so lively and quick,

481
00:22:26,543 --> 00:22:29,044
I knew in a moment it
must be Saint Nick."

482
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,301
Hello!

483
00:22:31,874 --> 00:22:34,016
Is nothing sacred?

484
00:22:34,017 --> 00:22:35,019
Now wait a minute.

485
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,711
Who let the two-headed
monster be Santa Claus?

486
00:22:37,712 --> 00:22:39,714
But he said he'd never
been in a play before.

487
00:22:39,715 --> 00:22:41,663
I mean, they said it.
Both of them said it.

488
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,938
Just go to the big finish.
Will you, please.

489
00:22:43,939 --> 00:22:46,524
"But I heard him exclaim
ere he drove out of sight,

490
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:50,653
mewwy chwi-mah to aww and
to aww a good nigh!"

491
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:55,095
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night!

492
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,520
Close the curtain!

493
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:00,771
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

494
00:23:00,772 --> 00:23:04,759
Sorry to break up your fun in here,
but have you folks seen the weather?

495
00:23:04,848 --> 00:23:07,850
- There's a real storm out there.
- Oh, lordy,

496
00:23:07,851 --> 00:23:11,947
I haven't seen a sky like that
since the blizzard of '41.

497
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,762
I tell you, Mr. Lizard,
it's a good thing

498
00:23:14,763 --> 00:23:18,265
all your friends are safe and
warm inside the farmhouse.

499
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:21,267
Yeah, but... all my friends
are not safe and warm.

500
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:23,874
Sorry to hear that it's...

501
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:26,481
Cold enough out there
to freeze your Winnebago.

502
00:23:28,135 --> 00:23:30,636
- Hello?
- Hello, Kermie.

503
00:23:30,637 --> 00:23:32,418
I've finished my shopping.

504
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:37,480
Unfortunately, Jerome got the
limo stuck in the snowbank.

505
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:41,450
So, I'll just have to catch
a taxi to the farmhouse.

506
00:23:41,451 --> 00:23:43,757
Listen, piggy, there's a
terrible storm outside...

507
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:45,619
And I really think it's
too dangerous to travel.

508
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,121
So why don't you wait for the
storm to end before you join us?

509
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:51,636
Nonsense. And miss my
Christmas Eve with vous?

510
00:23:51,637 --> 00:23:53,638
It's just a little bit of snow.

511
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:56,135
See you soon! Bye-bye.

512
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,725
Yo, taxi!

513
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:07,307
Aah!

514
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,986
My... oh!

515
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:13,566
Oh! Oh!

516
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,007
Aaah!

517
00:24:18,687 --> 00:24:20,619
I'm sure miss piggy
will be all right.

518
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:22,487
Kermit?

519
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:24,839
Kermit, y-y-you look worried.

520
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:27,793
I know exactly what you need.

521
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:29,382
- Comedy.
- What?

522
00:24:29,408 --> 00:24:30,210
Yeah, come on.

523
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:32,784
Now's the time for you
to meet my new partner!

524
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:33,994
Who's your new partner?

525
00:24:33,995 --> 00:24:35,678
- A snowman.
- The heck you say.

526
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,078
Yeah, yeah. Come on outside and
we'll do our act for you.

527
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,268
Outside? It's too cold to go outside.

528
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:41,658
- It's not cold.
- It is cold!

529
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:42,659
It's not cold.

530
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,707
Can I come in and warm up?

531
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:49,699
Okay, so it's cold.

532
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,873
I'm Kermit the frog. You must
be Fozzie's new partner.

533
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:55,375
I'll say. We're terrific.
Yeah, yeah. Come on!

534
00:24:55,376 --> 00:24:59,330
You are coming in a snowman,
but you are going out a star.

535
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:02,381
Hey, everybody, would you
like to see our new act?

536
00:25:02,382 --> 00:25:03,945
We'd love to see your act.

537
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:05,884
In fact, we'd hate
to miss your act.

538
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:07,981
In fact, we'd love
to hate your act.

539
00:25:10,036 --> 00:25:13,136
Statler, Waldorf, where'd
you guys come from?

540
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:17,294
They're friends of mine, Fozzie.
They come visit me every Christmas.

541
00:25:18,043 --> 00:25:21,346
M-my own mother is
friends with you guys?

542
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:23,651
These two comics are
made for each other.

543
00:25:23,775 --> 00:25:26,882
The snowman is ice cold,
and the bear's not so hot.

544
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:29,949
Oh, please.

545
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:33,161
After all, there's no
business like snow business.

546
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:37,330
Come on, ignore them.
Snowman, do the straight line.

547
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:40,300
- Okay. Hey, Fozzie!
- Yes, Mr. Snowman?

548
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:42,860
Did you hear about the church
that burned down?

549
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:44,277
Holy smoke!

550
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,560
That was our best joke.

551
00:25:48,562 --> 00:25:51,064
That does it, Fozzie.
Forget the act.

552
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:54,296
I'm startin' to melt.
It's too hot in here.

553
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:56,092
Well, you know what they say.

554
00:25:56,093 --> 00:25:59,093
If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the farmhouse.

555
00:26:01,597 --> 00:26:04,709
Oh, come on. You'll be
okay on the back porch.

556
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:08,071
Boy, that storm is
really getting worse.

557
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,541
Yeah, I hope miss piggy is okay.

558
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,865
There is one worried frog.

559
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:17,982
Aha! That's one. One worried frog.

560
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:19,849
He's not the only one.

561
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:22,716
That's two. Two worried frogs.

562
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:27,933
Search me. More small
talk, I think.

563
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,482
Hey, I'd better go out
and get some firewood.

564
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,674
Corka doon.

565
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:39,916
Hi there.

566
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,806
Did you wish to talk to me about
something, Mr. Cook, sir?

567
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:47,950
Oh, ja, ja, ja.

568
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:52,086
- Ungus sher doo.
- Gee, nice kitchen.

569
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:58,513
Hey, are you gonna have cranberry
sauce and mashed potatoes?

570
00:26:58,514 --> 00:27:00,690
Ja, ensperging Bern.

571
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:02,919
- Oh, boy.
- Yengis Bern da goobla-goobla.

572
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,344
I just want to hear
about the whole meal.

573
00:27:06,345 --> 00:27:07,751
Oh, yerngus sperg...

574
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:10,793
But first, I want to give
this little present to you.

575
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:12,355
Ebit her?

576
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:16,086
It's chocolate-covered birdseed.
I made it myself.

577
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:18,228
Engus sperg da merga mor?

578
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:20,676
I wanted to give it
to you because, well,

579
00:27:20,677 --> 00:27:23,975
I know that you're from Sweden and
it must be hard for you because

580
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:27,690
you're away from your family
and loved ones during the holidays.

581
00:27:27,735 --> 00:27:28,439
Ja.

582
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,441
At Christmas, there are
places and people and things

583
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:34,548
that become very, very special.

584
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,022
 Chestnuts roasting
on an open fire. 

585
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:44,532
 Jack frost nipping
at your nose. 

586
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:49,950
 Yule don smert egon
sverda gon mer. 

587
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:53,770
 Es sblergon yeber Eskimos. 

588
00:27:54,002 --> 00:27:59,464
 Everybody knows a Turkey
and some mistletoe, 

589
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:03,821
 yegon glerkon smernay ew. 

590
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,425
 Although it's been said
many times, many ways, 

591
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,222
 merry Christmas 

592
00:28:13,223 --> 00:28:15,225
 fleula yule. 

593
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,531
 Merry Christmas 
 fleula yule 

594
00:28:18,711 --> 00:28:23,559
-  to you. 
-  a vu. 

595
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:29,893
Now there, Mr. Cook, tell me...

596
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:33,763
Exactly what are you going
to fix for Christmas dinner?

597
00:28:33,764 --> 00:28:37,266
Ohhh, uh, ooh, oh, um...

598
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:39,692
Skraper vie don cranen boochers.

599
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,090
- Shredded wheat and cranberry sauce?
- Ja.

600
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:45,130
My absolute favorite.

601
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,156
Ja.

602
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:50,508
Ooh, going to be lots of snow
for me to shovel tomorrow.

603
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:53,286
Uh, it's getting worse
and worse out there.

604
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,844
Aren't you glad you're in
here all warm and toasty?

605
00:28:56,949 --> 00:28:59,450
I just wish miss piggy were.

606
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:04,464
Okay, when I yell
"three," gun it!

607
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,043
One, two, three!

608
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,327
You're really worried about your
friend, aren't you, Kermit?

609
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:30,846
Hmm? Oh, well, uh,
yeah, yeah, a little.

610
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,828
I'll tell you what. I'll
go out looking for her.

611
00:29:35,116 --> 00:29:38,403
Really? But you've never
even met miss piggy.

612
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:42,603
We never met any of you
until a little while ago.

613
00:29:42,604 --> 00:29:44,604
And now we're friends.

614
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:49,962
See, Sprockey and I were gonna spend
Christmas alone, but this is better!

615
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,152
Now, what's your
friend look like?

616
00:29:52,153 --> 00:29:56,156
Well, uh, to begin
with, she's a pig.

617
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:59,879
Well, up to a short while ago, I
would have thought that strange.

618
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:01,449
I'll give it a try.

619
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,085
Gee, thanks, doc.

620
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:08,841
You'll be sorry. It's cold
enough to freeze your Winnebago.

621
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:12,484
What a sweet guy.

622
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:14,573
Uncle Kermit?

623
00:30:14,574 --> 00:30:17,097
Robin? Where are you?

624
00:30:17,145 --> 00:30:18,228
In the cellar.

625
00:30:18,229 --> 00:30:19,506
What are you doing down there?

626
00:30:19,507 --> 00:30:21,114
I made a discovery.

627
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:23,032
Oh, yeah? What are
you talking about?

628
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:26,005
Remember telling me about Fraggle holes?

629
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:27,916
Uh, yeah. So?

630
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:30,673
And how if I ever found
one, we could go into.

631
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:33,275
Fraggle rock and maybe
meet some Fraggles?

632
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:34,680
Uh, so?

633
00:30:35,105 --> 00:30:36,402
Is that one?

634
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:39,905
Ooh, look at that. Well, it
certainly looks like one.

635
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:41,626
You never know where you're
going to find these things.

636
00:30:41,627 --> 00:30:43,693
Can we go in, uncle Kermit?

637
00:30:43,694 --> 00:30:47,775
Well, maybe just a little ways,
see if we can meet anyone.

638
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:51,651
Watch your step, Robin.

639
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:54,725
Gee, it's kind of scary.

640
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:57,607
These are beautiful caves. Oooh!

641
00:30:57,608 --> 00:31:00,793
- Hey, uncle Kermit, wait up.
- Hmm? Okay.

642
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:04,481
Do you think this is
really Fraggle rock?

643
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:05,969
Well I don't know but
if I were a Fraggle,

644
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,052
I think this is the kind
of place I'd hang out.

645
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,240
Wait a second.

646
00:31:11,665 --> 00:31:13,283
I thought I heard something.

647
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:16,011
Guess not.

648
00:31:16,797 --> 00:31:18,147
Well, anyhow.

649
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:25,864
Oh, uh, uh, well, uh, hi, there.

650
00:31:25,962 --> 00:31:27,217
- Hi, yourself.
- Hi.

651
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,982
- You're Fraggles.
- I'll say.

652
00:31:28,983 --> 00:31:30,984
- But you're not.
- I'll say.

653
00:31:30,985 --> 00:31:34,276
No, I'm Kermit. This is Robin.
We're frogs.

654
00:31:34,712 --> 00:31:36,340
Oh. What's a frog?

655
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:39,394
- They're frogs.
- I'll say.

656
00:31:39,395 --> 00:31:42,625
Don't touch 'em. Frogs are
probably noted germ carriers.

657
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:46,615
Well, actually, we just came down here
to wish you all a merry Christmas.

658
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:48,731
- Oh, thank you.
- That's nice.

659
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:50,350
- What's Christmas?
- Yeah.

660
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:53,213
- Oh, don't you have Christmas?
- No.

661
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:56,584
That's when you gather together
with the people you love...

662
00:31:56,895 --> 00:31:59,008
And you wish each
other peace on earth.

663
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:03,012
Oh! Oh, we have a
time like that.

664
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:07,015
Yes, we do. As a matter of fact,
we're celebrating it right now.

665
00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:12,020
We give each other presents. I'm
giving goober this nice yellow pebble.

666
00:32:12,021 --> 00:32:15,023
And I gave Mokie that
pebble last year.

667
00:32:15,024 --> 00:32:16,928
And I gave it to red
the year before that.

668
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:19,431
And I gave it to you, Wembley,
the year before that.

669
00:32:20,294 --> 00:32:22,699
That pebble's been
a gift 37 times.

670
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:25,267
- Thirty-seven times?
- Yeah.

671
00:32:25,268 --> 00:32:27,269
-  la-la-la la la 
-  la la la 

672
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,427
-  la-la-la-la la la 
-  la la la 

673
00:32:29,457 --> 00:32:31,280
 la-la-la la la   la la la 

674
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:33,097
 la-la, pass it on.. 

675
00:32:33,275 --> 00:32:36,901
 When it's nice and bright
and it brings delight. 

676
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,865
 Let your heart choose right got to...
Pass it on.. 

677
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:44,565
 When it feels real good
like a feeling should. 

678
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:48,392
 When it's understood got to...
Pass it on.. 

679
00:32:48,476 --> 00:32:52,252
 When you're giving love away
love will come again to stay. 

680
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:56,089
 What you give is what you
gain when you... Pass it on.. 

681
00:32:56,123 --> 00:33:00,005
 When I give a gift to you I
know you're gonna give it too. 

682
00:33:00,006 --> 00:33:03,884
 That's why giving's what we do as we...
Pass it on.. 

683
00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:05,746
 Pass it on. 
 Pass it on. 

684
00:33:05,795 --> 00:33:07,619
 Pass it on.  pass it on. 

685
00:33:07,648 --> 00:33:09,590
 Wish upon  wish upon 

686
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,502
 all the good things that you do. 

687
00:33:11,513 --> 00:33:13,395
 Pass it on. 
 Pass it on. 

688
00:33:13,396 --> 00:33:15,230
 Pass it on.   pass it on. 

689
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:17,317
 When it's gone,  when it's gone 

690
00:33:17,318 --> 00:33:19,140
 it will bring good luck to you. 

691
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:22,927
 When you're giving love away
love will come again to stay. 

692
00:33:22,928 --> 00:33:26,786
 What you give is what you
gain when you... Pass it on. 

693
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:30,621
 When I give a gift to you I
know you're gonna give it too. 

694
00:33:30,647 --> 00:33:34,451
 That's why giving's what we do as we...
Pass it on. 

695
00:33:35,017 --> 00:33:36,484
 Pass it on. 

696
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:41,601
And that's the way
Fraggle presents work.

697
00:33:42,025 --> 00:33:43,419
I love it!

698
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:46,340
Oh, goober, I almost forgot.
Huh?

699
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:49,241
I want you to have this pebble.

700
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:50,885
So, here.

701
00:33:50,886 --> 00:33:52,616
Wow! Oh!

702
00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:54,510
Oh. Ah. Thank you, Mokie.

703
00:33:55,144 --> 00:33:58,380
Hey, listen, Fraggles, this has all
been great, but we got to be going.

704
00:33:58,381 --> 00:34:00,250
Oh! Oh, what a shame.

705
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:02,244
- I'll say.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

706
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:04,179
Robin, before you go,

707
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,635
I'd like you to
have this pebble.

708
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:08,864
Wow!

709
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:11,304
Gee. Well, merry
Christmas, Fraggles.

710
00:34:11,323 --> 00:34:13,469
Merry Christmas, frogs.

711
00:34:13,536 --> 00:34:14,281
Bye! Bye!

712
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:15,723
- Bye!
- Bye!

713
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:17,463
Bye! Bye!

714
00:34:17,464 --> 00:34:19,513
Gosh, that was fun.

715
00:34:19,514 --> 00:34:22,327
Yeah, well, it's nice to be
with friends at Christmas.

716
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:26,047
Kermit, we hear shouting outside.
It could be miss piggy.

717
00:34:26,071 --> 00:34:27,857
Oh, well, let's go.

718
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,879
Anyone see her out there?

719
00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:34,296
Well, at least the storm
has eased up a bit.

720
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:36,286
Chef, why don't you
make some hot soup?

721
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:38,736
And, Mrs. Bear, would you put
some extra blankets on a bed?

722
00:34:38,737 --> 00:34:41,284
- Wait a minute. There she is!
- What?

723
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:01,647
Yeah, and she don't look bad...
For a pig.

724
00:35:11,337 --> 00:35:15,340
Oh! Merry Christmas, Kermie.
Am I late?

725
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,655
I-I-i don't know how to
explain this, Kermit,

726
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,158
but I was searching through
the snow and suddenly...

727
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,162
There was miss piggy with
this costume for me.

728
00:35:26,163 --> 00:35:27,896
You don't have to explain, doc.

729
00:35:27,897 --> 00:35:31,167
If there's one thing piggy knows,
it's how to make an entrance.

Ok mom. Hay everybody come in.

746
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:34,845
Hey, everybody.
Everybody, quiet.

747
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:38,098
My mother has an announcement.

748
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:42,603
Thank you, Fozzie. I'd like
to welcome you all here.

749
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,355
You are all here, aren't you?

750
00:36:46,356 --> 00:36:48,357
I think so, yes.

751
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:51,573
Oh, good, because I'm afraid
we're running out of room.

752
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:55,806
Two of you will have to sleep hung
on hangers on a hook on the wall.

753
00:36:55,807 --> 00:37:01,386
- What a fabulous idea!
- Love hanger. Love hanger. Ahh!

754
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:04,152
It's the only way animal
ever sleeps, ma'am.

755
00:37:05,773 --> 00:37:08,113
See, mom, I told
you it'd be easy.

756
00:37:08,257 --> 00:37:10,105
They're weirdos, Fozzie.

757
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:11,371
- Yeah?
- But...

758
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:12,880
They're nice weirdos.

759
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,103
Yeah.

760
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,901
Well, everybody, it's Christmas
Eve and the tree is trimmed.

761
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,951
So it's time for our annual carol sing.
Take it, Rowlf.

762
00:37:25,616 --> 00:37:29,117
-  happy holiday, 
-  happy holiday, 

763
00:37:29,118 --> 00:37:32,268
-  happy holiday. 
-  happy holiday. 

764
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:35,624
 May the calendar
keep bringing 

765
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:39,127
 happy holidays to you. 

766
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:42,456
-  happy holiday, 
-  happy holiday, 

767
00:37:42,457 --> 00:37:45,863

768
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,866
 May the merry bells
keep ringing 

769
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:52,111
 may your every
wish come true. 

770
00:37:53,424 --> 00:37:54,926
 Ding, dong merrily on high 

771
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:57,373
 in heaven the
bells are ringing. 

772
00:37:57,741 --> 00:37:59,743
 Ding, dong verily the sky 

773
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,377
 is riven with angels singing. 

774
00:38:02,378 --> 00:38:08,778
 Glo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-Ria 

775
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:11,147
 hosanna in excelsis. 

776
00:38:11,148 --> 00:38:13,149
- What's that?
- It's pretty.

777
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:15,675
- Let's go see, eh?
- Yeah!

778
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:17,892
 I saw three ships
come sailing in 

779
00:38:17,893 --> 00:38:20,100
 on Christmas day,
on Christmas day. 

780
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:22,103
 I saw three ships
come sailing in 

781
00:38:22,157 --> 00:38:24,322
 on Christmas day
in the morning. 

782
00:38:24,378 --> 00:38:26,379
 And what was in those
ships all three 

783
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,473
 on Christmas day.
On Christmas day. 

784
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,474
 And what was in those
ships all three 

785
00:38:30,531 --> 00:38:32,777
 on Christmas day
in the morning. 

786
00:38:34,802 --> 00:38:37,456
 Good king Wenceslas looked out, 

787
00:38:37,457 --> 00:38:39,958
 on the feast of Stephen, 

788
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:42,460
 when the snow lay round about, 

789
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:45,365
 deep and crisp and even; 

790
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,868
 brightly shone the moon that night, 

791
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:50,573
 tho' the frost was cruel, 

792
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,319
 when a poor man came in sight, 

793
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:57,363
 gathering winter fuel. 

794
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:02,830
 The holly and the ivy, 

795
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:05,334
 when they are both full grown, 

796
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:07,999
 of all the trees that are in the wood, 

797
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,719
 the holly bears the crown. 

798
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,223
 Oh, the rising of the sun 

799
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,714
 and the running of the deer, 

800
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,482
 the playing of the merry organ, 

801
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:21,715
 sweet singing in the choir. 

802
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,658
 I'll be home 

803
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,146
 for Christmas. 

804
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:37,586
 You can count on me. 

805
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:41,385
 You'll have snow 

806
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:44,514
 and mistletoe 

807
00:39:44,755 --> 00:39:50,260
 and presents on the tree. 

808
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,763
 Happy holiday, 
 happy holiday,

00:39:54,968 --> 00:39:58,469

 It's in every 

851
00:43:17,521 --> 00:43:20,514
 one of us 

852
00:43:20,873 --> 00:43:26,730
 by and by. 

853
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:30,368
 It's in every 

854
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:33,464
 one of us 

855
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:39,328
 by and by. 

856
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:46,283
 Old friends, new friends 

857
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:49,296
 home with the family. 

858
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,100
 We'll be together 

859
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:55,103
 at Christmas. 

860
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:58,327
 Snowflakes, sleigh bells 

861
00:43:58,607 --> 00:44:01,109
 bringing back memories. 

862
00:44:01,602 --> 00:44:04,040
 We'll be together 

863
00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:07,142
 at Christmas. 

864
00:44:07,372 --> 00:44:09,931
 Some things change 

865
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:12,874
 with passing years. 

866
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:19,140
 Let this feeling stay. 

867
00:44:19,415 --> 00:44:21,916
 Old friends, new friends 

868
00:44:22,128 --> 00:44:26,631
 hoping we'll always be 

869
00:44:26,632 --> 00:44:29,083
 here with each other 

870
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:34,472
 together on Christmas 

871
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:40,521
 day. 

872
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:46,149
You know, miss piggy, I think it's
time I gave you your present.

873
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:49,508
Oh, really? Oh, tell me,
what is it, what is it?

874
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:53,011
Well, your present is... a mink.

875
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:55,657
Ahh! A mink!

876
00:44:55,658 --> 00:44:56,994
- A mink.
- I've always wanted it.

877
00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:58,159
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

878
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,663
Uh, Maurine. Hi, I'm
Maurine, the mink.

879
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:03,742
What?

880
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,389
She said, "hi, I'm
Maurine, the mink."

881
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,167
I heard her! I heard her! Mmm.

882
00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:09,670
Well, this is, this is the mink?

883
00:45:09,671 --> 00:45:11,340
My mink? Of course.

884
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:14,890
Oh, miss piggy, I've seen
everything you've done.

885
00:45:14,891 --> 00:45:19,494
I'm your biggest fan. I worship
the ground you walk on.

886
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:25,183
- What a wonderful present!
- Yeah.

887
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:28,186
- Speaking of presents, Grover,
- huh?

888
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,688
I'd like you to have
this Fraggle pebble.

889
00:45:31,492 --> 00:45:34,191
T-this Fraggle pebble
here is for me?

890
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:36,516
Oh, I just love Christmas.

891
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:42,190
- Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

892
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:45,702
Merry Christmas, everyone.

893
00:45:46,117 --> 00:45:48,250

 and a happy new year. 

897
00:45:54,249 --> 00:45:57,919
Well, they certainly seem to be having
a good time, out there, Sprocket.

898
00:45:58,692 --> 00:46:00,687
Yeah, I like it when
they have a good time.

899
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,877
But I'll tell you what.

900
00:46:01,878 --> 00:46:04,246
Somebody's got to do something
about these dishes, Sprocket.

901
00:46:04,247 --> 00:46:05,247
Come on.

902
00:46:05,502 --> 00:46:07,287
I'll wash and you dry. Okay?

903
00:46:08,137 --> 00:46:10,137
 So bring it right here. 

904
00:46:10,138 --> 00:46:13,863
 Good tidings to you
wherever you are. 

905
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,938
 We wish you a merry Christmas

906
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,979

908
00:46:20,074 --> 00:46:22,075

909
00:46:22,076 --> 00:46:24,387
 We wish you a merry Christmas
