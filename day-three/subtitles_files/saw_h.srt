Is someone there?

Hey!

6
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:52,280
Oh, shit. I'm probably dead.

7
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,699
- [man] You're not dead.
- Who's that?

8
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,576
Who's that?

9
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,413
[man] There's no point in yelling.
I already tried that.

10
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:01,789
Turn on the lights!

11
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:04,375
[man] I would if I could.

12
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,461
What the fuck is going on?
Where am I?

13
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,714
[man] I don't know yet.

14
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,507

I don't know. Yeah!

30
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,269
What's your name?

31
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:50,272
My name is very fucking confused.

32
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,400
What's your name?
What's going on here?

33
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:55,152
My name is Lawrence Gordon.
I'm a doctor.

34
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,321
I just woke up here, just like you.

[Lawrence] Recognize him?

38
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,087
No.

39
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,467
Well, do you have any idea
how you got here?

40
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:19,718
No.

41
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,554
What's the last thing you remember?

42
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,682
Nothing. I went to bed
in my shithole apartment

43
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,184
and woke up in an actual shithole.

44
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:31,897
What about you, huh?

45
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,110
There's. .. there's not much to tell.

46
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:42,283
I was on my way home from work, and, uh,
I don't remember anything else.

47
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,332
First dead body I've ever seen.

48
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,460
Look different in real life.

49
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,088
They don't move.

50
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,471
From the looks of these chains,

51
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,848
someone didn't want us
to go very far, either.

52
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,933
[gasps, grunts]

53
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,894
Do you see any scars?

54
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,103
- What?
- Huh?

55
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:13,355
This is what they do, man!
They kidnap you and drug you.

56
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,899
Before you know it,
you're lying in a bathtub,

57
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,358
and your kidneys are on eBay.

58
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:19,069
No one has taken your kidneys.

59
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,779
How can you tell from way over there?

60
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,657
Because you'd either be in terrible agony

61
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,744
or you'd be dead by now.
Trust me.

62
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,163
- What are you, a surgeon?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,292
So...

64
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,338
you gonna tell me your name or what?

65
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:42,468
Adam.

66
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,262
Well, Adam...

67
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,516
What we need to do...

68
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,436
is start thinking about why we're here.

69
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,316
Whoever brought us here could have
killed us by now, but they didn't.

70
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,944
They must want something from us.

71
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,739
The question is what.

72
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,206
- That clock.
- What about it?

73
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,499
It's brand-new.

74
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,251
So?

75
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:19,338
So... somebody obviously
wanted us to know the time.

76
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,803
Wait. I think I might be able
to reach the door.

78
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:52,997
What is that?

79
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,751
Excuse me.

80
00:06:58,794 --> 00:06:59,837
It's a tape.

81
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,840
- Well, where'd you find it?
- It was in my pocket.

82
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,183
It says, "Play me."

83
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,838

Throw it over here.

86

- What?
- Your shirt.

95
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,672
It won't work.

96
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,925
Well, look around. There--
there must be something else you can use.

97
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,552
There's nothing.

98
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,262
Well, there must be something.

99
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,777
Come on. You can do it.

111
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,548

yourself die today, Adam,</i>

112
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,258

113
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,094
I don't get it.

You throw me your tape.

00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,737
police still hadn't caught him.

184
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,034
<i>And the only reason I know that
is because I was a suspect.</i>

185
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,330
<i>I'll start from the beginning.</i>

186
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,501
[flies buzzing]

187
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,798
This one's not fresh anymore.

188
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,592
At least three weeks out.

189
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,345
Victim's a 46-year-old male.

190
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,181
[camera clicking]

191
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:58,560
Died of massive blood loss,
mostly through the femoral artery.

192
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,899
He started at the back of the cage

193
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,067
and tunneled his way
through that razor wire so fast

194
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,486
it's amazing he got as far as he did.

195
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,992
Cut himself so deep, we found traces
of stomach acid on the floor.

196
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,290
We also found this.

You are a perfectly healthy,</i>

200
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:34,387
<i>yet last month, you ran a straight razor
across your wrist.</i>

201
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,558
<i>Did you out yourself
because you truly wanted to die,</i>

202
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:41,186
<i>or did you just want some attention?</i>

203
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,355
<i>Tonight, you'll show me.</i>

204
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:48,860
<i>The irony is that if you want to die,
you just have to stay where you are,</i>

205
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:52,030
<i>but if you want to live,
you'll have to out yourself again.</i>

206
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,992
<i>Find a path through
the razor wire to the door.</i>

207
00:17:56,326 --> 00:18:00,288
<i>But hurry, At 3:00, that door will lock,</i>

208
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:03,375
<i>and then this room becomes your tomb.</i>

209
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,795
<i>How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Paul?</i>

211
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,425
Door was on a timer.

212
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,511
It was unlocked until 3:00.

213
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,221
Then it slammed shut.

214
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:18,682
He was given two hours.

215
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,600

I think we're gonna be here

[Lawrence]
<i>The newspapers started calling him</i>

221
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,998
the Jigsaw Killer.

222
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:49,087
Actually, technically speaking,
he's not really a murderer.

223
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,799
He never killed anyone.

224
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,927
<i>He finds ways for his victims
to kill themselves.</i>

228
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,691
<i>Let's put your so-called
illness to the test.</i>

229
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:14,279
<i>Right now, there's a slow-acting
poison in your veins.</i>

00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,365
<i>The antidote is inside the safe.</i>

231
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,075
Help!

232
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,827
[sinister voice]
<i>The combination to the safe...</i>

233

<i>is written on the wall.</i>

234
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,625
<i>Hurry up and program it in,
but watch your step.</i>

235
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,379
<i>And by the way,
that's a flammable substance</i>

236
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,048
<i>smeared on your body.</i>

237
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,468
<i>So I would be careful
with that candle, if I were you.</i>

238
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:37,761
Help!

00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,180
<i>Or all the people
you've burned with your act</i>

240
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,098
<i>just might have their revenge.</i>

241
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,316
I found something else.

242
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,610
Well, uh, two things, actually.

243
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,447
There was someone standing outside here,
watching through this peephole.

244
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,449
Looks like our friend Jigsaw
likes to book himself

245
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,077
front-row seats
to his own sick little games.

246
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,537
He was there at the last one as well.

247
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,250
Only this time...
he left us his penlight.

248
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,130
Hmm...

249
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,759
Get a rush on the prints.

250
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:18,968
Copy that.

251
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,722
OK, this patient has an inoperable
frontal-lobe tumor

252
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,307
extending across the midline.

253
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,559
It started as colon cancer.

254
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,896
Patient has come in
for a standard checkup,

255
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:34,275
by which we are able to monitor the rate
at which his condition is declining.

256
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,735
The patient had--

257
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,778
His name is John...

258
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,030
Dr. Gordon.

259
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,991
He's a very interesting person.

260
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,870
Thank you for that information, Zep.

261
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:50,250
As you can see, our orderlies form
very special bonds with the patients.

262
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,920
Continuing on, the patient had--

263
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,214
[woman <i>on</i> speaker] <i>Dr. Lawrence Gordon,
please page the operator.</i>

264
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,635
Obviously, someone doesn't want me
to tell you what the patient had.

265
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:01,886
Excuse me.

266
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:06,724
[door opens]

267
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,437
Dr. Gordon. I'm Detective Tapp.

268
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,647
This is Detective Sing. City Homicide.

269
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,566
Very impressive.

270
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,734
- Oh, thank you.
- [Tapp chuckles]

271
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,903
I do my best.

272
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,616
Sorry to interrupt you
while you're working.

273
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,536
It's fine. Now, how can
I help you gentlemen?

274
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,456
Are you able to tell us
where you were between the hours

275
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:32,375
of 11:00 pm. and 1:00 am.
last night, Doctor?

276
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,336
Why is it that you're interested?

277
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,964
We'd like to ask you
a few questions about it.

278
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:42,719
For your sake, I think it's best
if we do it down at the station.

279
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,554
Would you like to follow us there?

280
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,680
[scoffs]

281
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,932
I'm afraid that's-that's quite
out of the question.

282
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,310
I can't just leave.
I have work to do, and--

283
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,811
Plus, my wife has the car today, so--

284
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,897
That's OK. You can ride with us...

285
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,648
Doc.

286
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,239
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

287
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,034
You'll have to tell me again.
What is this all about?

288
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,204
Is this yours, Doctor?

289
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,844
[man] So, you have no idea
how your penlight

290
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:25,970
showed up at the murder scene?

291
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,639
Of course not, Brett.

292
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,268
Well, I have to ask...

293
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,395
what were you doing last night?

294
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,900
I was seeing someone.

295
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:41,819
Who?

296
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,201
Look, if you can't be honest with me--

297
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,328
I was visiting someone.
It wasn't a patient.

298
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,621
All right?

299
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,709
What am I gonna do?

300
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,420
Well, as your lawyer and your friend,

301
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:03,383
my advice to you is to bite the bullet
and give them your alibi now,

302
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,719
'cause no one's gonna believe you later.

303
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,722
[sighs]

304
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,185
That was five months ago.

305
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,774
He tried to set me up for murder.

306
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,113
OK.

307
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,908
We checked your alibi. It holds up.

308
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,953
Good. Can I go home now?

309
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,331
[Sing] We have one of the victims
who managed to escape.

310
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:38,167
We want to know if you
wouldn't mind sticking around

311
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,253
and listening to her testimony.

312
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,463
Maybe it'll trigger something.

313
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:45,717
- I'd like to help, really, but--
- Well, we'd really appreciate it.

314
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:49,095
- She's the only one who made it.
- OK.

315
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,394
Amanda...

316
00:23:57,812 --> 00:23:59,314
in your own time...

317
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,859
tell me the first thing you remember.

318
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:22,253

325
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,967
<i>The device you're wearing is hooked into
your upper and lower jaws.</i>

326

<i>When the timer on the back goes off,</i>

327
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:16,557
<i>your mouth will be
permanently ripped open.</i>

328
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:20,103
<i>Think of it like a reverse bear trap.</i>

329
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,647
<i>Here, I'll show you.</i>

[muffled screams]

332
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:38,162
<i>There's only one key to open the device.</i>

333
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,249
<i>It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.</i>

334
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,669
<i>Look around, Amanda.</i>

335
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,587
<i>Know that I'm not lying.</i>

336
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,631
<i>You better hurry up.</i>

337
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:53,052
<i>Live or die. Make your choice.</i>

341
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,259
And then I saw the body.

[Sing] He'd been injected
with an opiate overdose.

349
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:38,366
Couldn't move or feel much of anything.

350
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:43,079
You mean... he was alive?

351
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,372
Was.

352
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,084
What happened after you took it off?

<i>Most people are so ungrateful
to be alive, but not you.</i>

356
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:02,074
<i>Not anymore.</i>

00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:11,250
You are, in fact, a drug addict.

358
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:13,085
Isn't that right, Mandy?

359
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,548
Do you think that is why he picked you?

360
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,551
[crying]

361
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,390
[Tapp] Are you grateful, Mandy?

362
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:32,605
He...

363
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,191
helped me.

364
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,256
[light buzzing]

365
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,814
Are you sure it's him?

366
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,275
Yeah, I'm sure.

367
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,486
How do I know you're telling the truth?

368
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,364
You could be the one
who put me in this room!

369
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:27,118
I'm in exactly the same situation
that you're in.

370
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,370
Wrong. Wrong!

371
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,998
You've got one thing I don't; information!

372
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,749
You know who did this.

373
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,545
Now, you either tell me
what is really going on,

374
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,714
or I'll cut you with this!
You hear me? I'll cu--

375
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,390
- What?
- It's a two-way mirror.

376
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,213
[man] I can see you.

377
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,716
<i>[Adam] 80, that's What this is...</i>

378
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,676
<i>reality TV.</i>

379
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,596
[man] Don't look at me. I can't help you.

380
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,639
Can you hear me in there, huh?

381
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,433
I'm having a blast.

382
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,351
This is the most fun
I've had without lubricant.

383
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,688
Make sure you're getting everything.

384
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,110
That's not gonna do anything.

385
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,405
You just want to leave it running on us?

386
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:47,865
[Lawrence] <i>Well, you won't stop it.</i>

387
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:50,534
Well, that's why we
can't cut through these chains.

388
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,244
It's why you won't break that glass.

389
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:55,581
Every possible angle
has been pre-thought out by him.

390
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,958
You make it sound like
you admire this prick.

391
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,044
To overcome something,

392
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,379
you have to understand
what a perfect engine it is.

393
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:04,173
That's how you fight disease.

394
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,135
Now the tape told us to find an "X."

395
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:10,805
That "X“ has to be
somewhere in this room.

396
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,098
Help me find it.

397
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:15,726
How can you be the calm doctor guy
when your wife and kid are out there?

398
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,394
He's got them, too.

399
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,063
He could be doing anything
to them right now.

400
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,817
- Are you thinking about that?
- I am thinking about that.

401
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,159
I've been thinking about
the last thing I said to my daughter.

402
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,801
[wind chimes ringing]

403
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:21,792
[wood banging softly]

404
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:34,889
[clock ticking]

405
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,557
Diana, honey, are you OK?

406
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,102
Diana, honey, can you hear me?

407
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:23,771
Mommy.

408
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,731
What is it, sweet pea?

409
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,025
There's a man in my room.

410
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:32,613
Oh, honey, are you sure
he's not just hiding in your imagination?

411
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,406
He talked to me.

412
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,535
[sighs] OK. I'll come and check your room.

413
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,623
I want Daddy. He'll get the scary man.

414
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,835
All right, if you want.
Come on.

415
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:54,260
Larry, sorry to bother you,
but your daughter had a bad dream again.

416
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:55,469
Just a minute.

417
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,514
She wants you to check her room.

418
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:02,351
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Just-just got to finish this paragraph.

419
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:08,482
Come on, sweetie. I'll check with you.

420
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,653
Nope. I'm done.

421
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,533
See? There's no one in your room.

422
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,745
There's no such thing as the bad man.

423
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,622
Now can you go to sleep?

424
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:26,166
- I'm still scared.
- You are?

425
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,584
Give me your tootsie.

426
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:30,504
[grunts]

427
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,131
Oh, what a big tootsie.

428
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,425
Remember this one?

429
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,094
This little piggy went to market.

430
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,430
This little piggy stayed home.

431
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:41,765
This little piggy had roast beef.

432
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,851
This little piggy had none.

433
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,145
And this little piggy went...

434
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:50,149
- Whee. .. all the way home!
- [pager beeping]

435
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,111
I hate that thing.

436
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,947
Well, I have to go to work, sweetheart.

437
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:59,491
You know what daddy's job is like.
Now, come on.

438
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,995
Let's see.

439
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,206
Try and get some sleep now, OK?

440
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,291
OK.

441
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,258
You're not gonna leave us,
are you, Daddy?

442
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,802
What?

443
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,765
What are you talking about?

444
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,352
You mean leave you and Mommy?

445
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:30,147
[soft chuckle]
No. No, sweetheart. I...

446
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,483
I would never do that.

447
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:35,110
Who gave you that idea?

448
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,488
No one.

449
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,699
Well, it's not true, OK?

450
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:42,785
OK.

451
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,661
How much do I love you?

452
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,413
- Love you very much.
- ...very much.

453
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:48,624
- That's right. That's right.
- [laughs]

454
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,377
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Daddy.

455
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:57,633
Tomorrow...

456
00:36:58,175 --> 00:36:59,843
I'll read you your favorite story.

457
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,221
- OK.
- OK.

458
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,306
[Alison] <i>I don't know how much longer
I can do this, Larry.</i>

459
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,682
[Lawrence]
Do what? What are you talking about?

460
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,768
[Alison] How can you walk through life
pretending that you're happy?

461
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,479
- I am happy.
- That is complete bullshit.

462
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,315
I would rather you just break down
and tell me that you hate me.

463
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:15,359
At least there would be
some passion in it.

464
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:16,777
[clock ticking]

465
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,324
Would you like to see her?

466
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,634
[Adam] She's beautiful.

467
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,761
[Lawrence] Thank you.

468
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:45,347
You gonna have any more kids?

469
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:47,599
Ah, we've talked about it,

470
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:51,812
but, uh... with our schedules it's...

471
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:55,190
it's difficult enough
to concentrate on one.

472
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:59,153
So, where's the lucky wife?

473
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,489
There's another picture
behind the one you're looking at.

474
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:04,408
It's my favorite one because...

475
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,077
we're all in it together.

476
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:10,330
Someone, usually me,
has to hold the camera,

477
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,875
which means I'm always
missing from the photos.

478
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,136
[sinister voice]
"X" <i>marks</i> the <i>spot.</i>

00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:32,728
It's, uh... it's not here.

481
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:34,897
What?

482
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,733
This photo you're talking about
is not here.

483
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,569
Really? Are you sure?

484
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,488
Yeah. Just... Oh!

485
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:58,629
Why, he... he must have taken it. I...

486
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,548
[Alison] How can you walk through life
pretending that you're happy?

487
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:05,052
- I am happy.
- That is complete bullshit.

488
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,012
I'd rather you break down
and tell me that you hated me.

489
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,056
At least there would be
some passion in it.

490
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,354
We'll talk about this later, OK?

491
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:18,482
[siren blaring in distance]

492
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:19,942
Just leave.

Let go of her!

[Tapp] Oh, you little man, I see you.

517
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:01,770
Does Dr. Gordon know
you're at home with his wife?

518
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:06,233
I know you know something.

519
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,573
What are you doing in there?

520
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:16,326
Waiting for the doctor?

521
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,287
I'm waiting for the doctor, too.

522
00:42:30,841 --> 00:42:33,635
I never should have let you go.

<i>Dr. Gordon, are you able to tell us
where you were last night?</i>

530

And you have no idea how your
penlight showed up at the murder scene?

00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:16,428
Here we are.

534
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:22,642
That was, uh, quite an amazing story
that poor woman told.

535
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:39,493
Look, I'm...

536
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,997
I'm sorry I can't be of more help
to your investigation.

537
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,919
You know, we arrested a dentist last week.

538
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,171
He liked to play with kids a bit too much.

539
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:54,007
He lived two blocks from here.

540
00:43:55,175 --> 00:44:00,055
The sewer lines run under
this neighborhood, too... Doctor.

541
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:12,692
[engine starts]

542
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:30,418
[sinister voice] <i>Hello, Amanda.
You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

543
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:32,629
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

544
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:35,215
<i>Here's what happens if you lose:</i>

545
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:40,929
<i>There's a timer at the back
of the device you're wearing.</i>

546
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,056
- [man] Hey.
- <i>When the timer goes off...</i>

547
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,725
[indistinct chatter]

548
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:47,310
[videotape fast-forwarding]

549
00:44:47,394 --> 00:44:48,895
[Sing] Hey, I'll catch
you guys down there.

550
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:50,981
[sinister voice]
<i>Think of it like a reverse bear trap.</i>

551
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,989
- <i>I'll show you.</i>
- [clock ticking]

552
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,995
- Hey, Tapp.
-Hmm?

553
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:07,706
We're gonna go down
to the grill to get a beer.

554
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:10,166
- You want to come?
- I don't think so. Thanks anyway.

555
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,460
Well, you know, I always ask.

556
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:15,672
<i>- There's only one key to open...</i>
- I'll <i>leave you to have fun up here.</i>

557
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,090
- Mm-hm.
- <i>It's in the stomach</i>

558
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,800
<i>of your dead cellmate.</i>

559
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:22,762
Hey, Tapp,
I don't mean for this to be disrespectful.

560
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:26,975
Maybe you should
find yourself a girlfriend.

561
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:30,020
[both laugh softly]

562
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:33,398
[sinister voice] <i>It's in the stomach
of your dead Gel/mate.</i>

563
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,025
<i>Look around--</i>

564
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:40,739
<i>Look around, Amanda.
Know that I'm not lying.</i>

565
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,991
<i>You better hurry up.</i>

566
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:47,537
Wait, wait, wait. Hey, Sing.

567
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,917
- Get back here.
- What?

568
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,876
Mm!

569
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,377
[sighs]

570
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,010
What?

571
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:04,596
Hey...

572
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,307
Remember 118th street?

573
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:12,479
Uh... K2K.

574
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:15,649
That gang's territory
was only about four blocks.

575
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,108
Now listen to this.

576
00:46:21,655 --> 00:46:23,698
[alarm ringing faintly]

577
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:33,166
We got to check the records
for all the fire emergencies

578
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,126
that occurred in that area
within the last two weeks.

579
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,295
Go, right now. Mmm!

580
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:39,339
[Sing]
On the night of Tuesday the 17th,

581
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:43,510
we got a fire alarm going off
in the rear wing of 213 Stygian Street.

582
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:46,930
It's an old listing.
Used to be a mannequin factory.

583
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,975
You think we have enough
for a warrant, though?

584
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,851
Who said anything about a warrant?

585
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,562
- Right now?
- Why not?

586
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:56,022
Yeah, why not?

587
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:06,783
[gun being loaded]

588
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,494
[Tapp] At least we'll have
the cover of darkness.

589
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,913
[Sing]
Yeah. Well, so will anybody else.

590
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,002
[banging]

591
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,399
[grunts]

592
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,045
I got you.

593
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:54,557
What the hell is this?

594
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,700
Oh, Shit.

595
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,002
[groaning]

596
00:49:23,545 --> 00:49:24,963
[Sing] Oh, fuck!

597
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:31,970
[muffled shouts]

598
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,809
[door opens]

599
00:49:40,562 --> 00:49:41,938
- Wait, Sing.
- What?

600
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,065
- Let's see what he's gonna do.
- Why? we fuckin' got him.

601
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:45,316
- I just wanna make sure--
- What?

602
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,026
We don't know what he looks like.
Let's see what he's gonna do.

603
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,987
- [Sing] No fucking way.
- Sing!

604
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,405
- Fuck that. I'm gonna take him.
- Sing, Sing!

605
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,658
- [muffled]
- What the fuck? Shit!

606
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,829
[muffled shouts continue]

607
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,040
[man] Awake already, Jeff?

608
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:45,543
I need more powerful
tranquilizers next time.

609
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:49,631
Don't cry.
I've given your life a purpose.

610
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:52,800
You're a test subject
for something greater than yourself.

611
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:55,220
- Freeze! Police!
- Hold it right there! Don't move!

612
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:57,472
Put your fucking hands in the air!

613
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:03,144
[drills whirring]

614
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,022
[man] Now you'll make a choice.

615
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:09,067
In 20 seconds,
the life of this man will be ended.

616
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,111
- Shut it off and get down here!
- What'd you do? Turn it off!

617
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:13,821
- [shouting]
- [Tapp] Sing, stop that thing.

618
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,990
- I'm taking this bastard down.
- Fine.

619
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,035
- Move!
- How do you turn it off?

620
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,788
- Tell him how to stop it, asshole!
- One key will unlock it.

621
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:24,165
- Where is it?
- [man] It's in the box.

622
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:25,708
Box?

623
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,503
Fuck!

624
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,092
- Which key? Which key?
- Tell him which key it is!

625
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:35,093
Time's running out.

626
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:37,345
Shut up and get down here
right now, asshole!

627
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,640
What's more important to you, Officer,

628
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:43,393
arresting me or the life
of another human being?

629
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,938
Get down on your knees, asshole!

630
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,690
Hands behind your head!

631
00:51:49,274 --> 00:51:50,775
- [Sing] Tapp!
- Sick bastard!

632
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,485
Yes, I'm sick, Officer.

633
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,737
Tapp, there's like--
There's 100 keys here!

634
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:58,157
Sick from the disease
eating away at me inside,

635
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:01,160
sick of people who don't
appreciate their blessings,

636
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:04,497
sick of those who scoff
at the suffering of others.

637
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,710
I'm sick of it all!

638
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:11,963
Tapp!

639
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:24,058
No! No! Tapp! Tapp! Shit!

640
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,893
You're OK. Let me see.

641
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:28,938
[panting]

642
00:52:29,022 --> 00:52:30,773
- I'm gonna be back. I'm gonna be back.
- OK.

643
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:07,143
Freeze, or I'll shoot!

644
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,992
[groaning]

645
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,393
[grunting]

646
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:34,647
[police radio chatter indistinct]

647
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:38,484
I had you.

648
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:41,070
I had you on your knees.

649
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:44,907
But you're running. You're running.

650
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:49,370
You're running scared because we had you.

651
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,915
We're gonna close this case.

652
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:57,253
We-- We're gonna close it.
Right, Sing? Right?

653
00:54:57,837 --> 00:54:59,589
We're gonna close it, Sing.

654
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:11,434
[Lawrence] <i>"X" marks the spot.
"X" marks the spot.</i>

655
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:14,061
<i>We need to search this room again.</i>

656
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:16,314
<i>What are you doing over there?</i>

657
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:20,026
Excuse me.

658
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,862
Just because I'm stuck
in this room with you

659
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,531
doesn't mean I have to report to you
every ten seconds.

660
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:29,619
I really don't see the point
in us not helping one another.

661
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:33,414
What do you want me to do?
I'm on a leash.

662
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:36,542
That's exactly why we need to talk.
We need to think.

663
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:38,002
I am thinking!

664
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,880
Then don't keep me in the dark
about what you're thinking!

665
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:45,510
Turn off the lights.

666
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,136
What?

667
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,556
Turn them off now, please.

668
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,516
Why?

669
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,392
Just turn them off for a second.

670
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:09,992
Jesus. Behind you.

671
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:16,457
How come we didn't see that before?

672
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,960
The lights in here hadn't charged it.

673
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:20,962
It must be glow-in-the-dark
paint or something.

674
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:56,455
[beeping]

675
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,005
- Open it.
- It's locked.

676
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:08,134
The key, the one from my envelope,
where is it?

677
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:14,640
Where the fuck? Here.

678
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,165
[soft chuckle]

679
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:44,128
A cell phone.

680
00:57:44,337 --> 00:57:46,922
The most beautiful invention
on this planet.

681
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,428
[laughs]

682
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:54,639
Make that second most
beautiful invention.

683
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:56,974
<i>- Give me that.
- Are you joking?</i>

684
00:57:57,058 --> 00:57:59,977
<i>You're gonna put something
that you found in this room in your mouth?</i>

685
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:03,648
Yes. I'm willing to risk it.

686
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,399
Give me that sweet cancer.

687
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:09,070
I don't care. I really don't.

688
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:10,780
Give me one of those.

689
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:14,575
[sinister voice]
<i>The cigarettes are harmless, I promise.</i>

690
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:18,579
<i>Smoking is only poisonous
when it ends in bloodshed.</i>

691
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:22,333
<i>Think about this;
you don't need a gun to kill Adam.</i>

692
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:25,044
May I please have a cigarette?

693
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,880
I'm trying the police.

694
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,050
[dialing]

695
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:33,928
[beeping]

696
00:58:35,346 --> 00:58:37,056
[dialing]

697
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,850
- [beeping]
- Shit.

698
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:44,438
This was meant to receive calls,
not make them.

699
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,858
Wait a minute.

700
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:50,653
This has happened before.

701
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:58,244
<i>Last night, after I finished
at the hospital...</i>

702
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:02,498
<i>I was walking back to my car.</i>

703
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,085

704
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:09,588

00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,174
[camera clicks]

00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:41,954
[busy signal]

707
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:53,883
Great.

[beeping]

710
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:42,056
That... thing was waiting for me.

711
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,401
How did you know to turn off the lights?

712
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:56,445
Who cares? It worked.

713
01:00:56,529 --> 01:00:57,905
Yeah, but how did you know?

714
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:01,033
- Instinct.
- Instinct?

715
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,284
Yeah.

716
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:05,704
You know what?
You're a terrible liar.

717
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:08,457
You say that like you know me.

718
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,502
What else aren't you telling me?

719
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,672
[scoffs]
Well, um, let's see.

720
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:18,467
On my sixth birthday,
my best friend at the time,

721
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:21,303
Scott Tibbs, stabbed me with a rusty nail.
I didn't tell you about that.

722
01:01:21,387 --> 01:01:22,721
I didn't tell you
that my last girlfriend,

723
01:01:22,805 --> 01:01:23,973
who was a feminist vegan punk,

724
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:26,517
broke up with me
because she thought I was too angry.

725
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,602
I haven't told you
that one of my toenails is slightly--

726
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:30,229
Just stop it!

727
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:33,482
You knew to turn off these lights.

728
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:34,859
Whatever.

729
01:01:34,942 --> 01:01:37,653
I'm dealing with a juvenile.

730
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:40,155
- You want to know?
- Yeah!

731
01:01:43,242 --> 01:01:44,618
Here it is.

732
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:55,921
Come.

733
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:00,843
Oh, God.

734
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:08,809
Wh-where did you get this?

735
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:10,561
It was in your wallet...

736
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,938
behind the photo of your daughter.

737
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:15,649
Wh-why didn't you show me this before?

738
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:17,568
I couldn't.

739
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:20,988
[whimpering]

740
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:23,240
I'm sorry.

741
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,921
What are you doing to them, you bastard?!

742
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,348
OK. OK.

743
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,601
OK, I've got to think now.

744
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:55,564
[sinister voice] <i>Think about this.</i>

745
01:02:55,648 --> 01:02:58,025
<i>You don't need a gun to kill Adam.</i>

746
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,528
<i>When there's that much
poison in your blood,</i>

747
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:05,491
<i>the only thing left to do
is shoot yourself.</i>

748
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:39,942
[Adam] What are you doing?

749
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,078
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

750
01:03:52,121 --> 01:03:55,833
[Lawrence whispering]
Shh. Adam, listen to me.

751
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,668
I want you to play along with me on this.

752

[indistinct whispering]

753
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:06,844
[Lawrence] You got that?

754
01:04:20,149 --> 01:04:23,027
So, you, uh...
you still want that cigarette?

755
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:26,196
Um, yeah.

756
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,364
Sure.

There! I've done it!

760
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:42,439
I've killed him with the poison
just like you wanted!

761
01:05:42,523 --> 01:05:44,566
Now where's my family?

762
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,193
Where are they?

- I-I just got electrocuted!
- What?

767

Jesus, that was our way out.

768
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,548
Did you hear what I said?

769
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:10,050
Get this thing off me! Get it off!

770
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:11,760
Stop acting!

771
01:06:11,844 --> 01:06:13,345
You think I would make that up

772
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:15,389
just to mess up
your stupid fuckin' Charade?!

773
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,890
All right, that's it.

Are they OK?

850
01:13:08,677 --> 01:13:10,845
My wife, she, uh...

851
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:12,764
She mentioned your name.

852
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:16,351
What did she say?

853
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,354
She told me...

854
01:13:21,106 --> 01:13:22,399
not to believe you.

855
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:25,110
Believe me about what?

856
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:30,365
She told me you knew me.

857
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,454
Who are you?

858
01:13:37,706 --> 01:13:39,541
You know who I am.

859
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:42,210
Stop the lies! You're a liar!

860
01:13:42,294 --> 01:13:44,254
I need to know the truth!

861
01:13:46,298 --> 01:13:47,716
I'm a liar?

862
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:51,469
What did you do last night, Lawrence?

863
01:13:52,387 --> 01:13:55,015
Work at a hospital, saving sick children?

864
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:57,851
You told me that after you
left your house last night,

865
01:13:57,934 --> 01:13:59,894
you went to work at a hospital.

866
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:01,479
That's because it's the truth.

867
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:02,939
No, it's not.

868
01:14:03,398 --> 01:14:05,609
Your wife is right, Larry.

869
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,571
You don't recall getting
your picture taken in that parking lot?

870
01:14:28,173 --> 01:14:31,343
I can prove that you didn't go
anywhere near a hospital last night.

871
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,603
It's not the first time
I've done it, either, Larry.

872
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:44,230
I've been taking pictures of you
for a few days now.

873
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:52,989
- Why?
- You want to know what I do?

874
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:55,575
I get paid to take pictures
of rich guys like you

875
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:58,828
who go to seedy, out-of—the-way motels
to fuck their secretaries.

876
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:01,915
Last night, I went to your house
and watched you leave.

877
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,376
<i>I followed you...</i>

878
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:08,129
<i>all the way to that shit-bag hotel.</i>

879
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:14,844
You've, uh, had these with you
the whole time?

880
01:15:14,928 --> 01:15:18,390
No, I found them in there
with the hacksaws.

881
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,308
I don't know how they got there.

882
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:24,145
Yeah, right. You're so full of it!

883
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:27,190
Ah, face it, Larry.
We're both bullshitters.

884
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,275
But my camera isn't.
It doesn't know how to lie.

885
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:32,195
It only shows you
what's put right in front of it.

886
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:35,573
Just out of curiosity,
what did you do in that motel room?

887
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,909
You got out of there pretty fast.

888
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:48,461
Why did you, um...

889
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:52,465
deem it necessary to page me
when you knew I was at home?

890
01:15:54,259 --> 01:15:56,219
I didn't know if you were gonna make it.

891
01:15:57,011 --> 01:16:00,515
But I-I gave you a precise time
at which to page me.

892
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:03,893
You-you can't do that.

893
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:06,730
It's not like I know the rules
for this sort of stuff.

895

What's wrong, Dr. Gordon?

896
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:13,987
Look, urn...

897
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:17,657
it was wrong of me to make you come here.

898
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:22,620
- But I thought we--
- No, no. Please.

899
01:16:23,955 --> 01:16:25,415
I'm sorry.

No.

It's for you.

- What happened?

Who was what?

918
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:05,640
The person who paid you
to follow me, who was it?

919
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:07,851
He calls himself Bob,
and he gives me the money up front.

920
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:09,769
Two-hundred bucks a night.

921
01:18:09,853 --> 01:18:11,062
If I'd known I was gonna end up here,

922
01:18:11,145 --> 01:18:12,564
I would have asked for
a hell of a lot more.

923
01:18:12,647 --> 01:18:14,274
What-what does that mean?

924
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:15,817
Does that mean you saw
what happened to me?

925
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:19,529
What I saw was you get into your car.
That's it.

926
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:22,323
I didn't ask your name.
I didn't know who you were.

927
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:25,660
I don't know how I got here.
I don't know how you got here.

<i>I just took the shots
and went straight home to develop them.</i>

929
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:34,544
Next thing I know, I'm chained to a pipe
in some prehistoric bathroom,

930
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:36,796
staring at the guy
I've been taking shots of all night.

931
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,215
Clearly, whoever paid you
to take pictures of me

932
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:41,426
- is the one who put us here.
- Maybe.

933
01:18:41,509 --> 01:18:43,553
What do you mean "maybe"? Of course it is.
What did he look like?

934
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:46,347
- I don't know, he's just a guy.
- Was he tall? Was he skinny, obese, what?

935
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:47,932
I don't take notes about his appearance.

936
01:18:48,016 --> 01:18:49,726
- You must remember something about him.
- I can't!

937
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:51,603
You're telling me you don't remember
a thing about the guy?

938
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:55,148
- I told you--
- Oh, for fuck's sake! I give up!

939
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:58,776
He's a tall black guy.
He's got a scar around his neck, OK?

940
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:09,370
Tapp.

01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:16,002
[Adam] Whoa.

943
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:19,213
The guy who paid me
to take these photos was not a cop.

944
01:19:19,297 --> 01:19:22,216
No, no, no. He was-- He was discharged
from the police force.

945
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,802
He broke down
after his partner was killed.

946
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:27,055
<i>But that didn't stop him
from harassing me.</i>

947
01:19:27,138 --> 01:19:28,848
<i>The guy became obsessed.</i>

948
01:19:28,932 --> 01:19:31,726
He convinced himself that I must have
somehow been involved with the murders.

949
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,686
- <i>I mean-- He's crazy.</i>
- [laughing]

950
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:35,021
And you helped him.

951
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:38,107
You took money from him
to invade my privacy.

952
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:42,070
- How could you do that?
- Call it my need to eat.

953
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:45,490
Right. Right. You know what, Adam?

954
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:48,034
You're not a victim of this game;
you're part of it.

955
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:51,621
Oh, really? Obviously, this cop
thinks you're the one behind it all.

956
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,623
I told you, he's not a cop.

957
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:56,042
He's a bottom feeder, just like you.

958
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:58,753
What are you more pissed off about:
the fact that I took some shots of you,

959
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:01,589
or the fact that I took some shots of you
while you were cheating on your wife?

960
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:03,508
I did not cheat on her!

961
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:05,468
What do you care what I think anyway?

962
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:07,845
I don't give a crap
if you covered yourself in peanut butter

963
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:10,098
and had a 15-hooker gang bang.

964
01:20:25,363 --> 01:20:27,115
