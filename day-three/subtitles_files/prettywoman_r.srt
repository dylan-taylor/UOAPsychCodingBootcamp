1
00:00:17,377 --> 00:00:19,879
No matter what they say,
it's all about money.

2
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,299
Imagine that you're
a savings and loan officer.

3
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:26,719
Watch. One, two, three. See?

4
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:29,347
You've got it all,
and we've got nothin'.

5
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:31,933
You have all four. Take a look.
Ah!

6
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:35,979
I wouldn't trust you with real gold.
That's why this is only worth a penny.

7
00:00:36,062 --> 00:00:38,982
If you wonder where
the other one went, watch.

8
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:41,401
A penny from the ear.
How much for the rest?

9
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:44,487
Have you seen Edward?
No. Great party, Philip.

10
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:47,574
My wife went to a lot of trouble.
She called the caterer.

11
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:51,327
Howard, how are you?
Edward's taking over Morse Industries?

12
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:53,830
He's not here to get tan.
Can I get in on it?

13
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:55,415
Yeah. Just call me.
When?

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,251
Hi. I'm Philip Stuckey,
Edward Lewis's lawyer.

15
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:00,879
Where's the guest of honour?
I don't know.

16
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:04,757
He's probably in a corner charming
a very pretty lady. How are you?

17
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:08,303
I told my secretary to make the
arrangements. Didn't she call you?

18
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:12,265
Yes, she did. I speak to
your secretary more than I speak to you.

19
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:15,185
I see.
I have my own life too, Edward.

20
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:18,146
This is a very important week
for me. I need you here.

21
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:22,609
You never give me any notice.
You think I'm at your beck and call.

22
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:25,653
I do not believe that you are
at my beck and call.

23
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:29,073
That's the way you make me feel.
Maybe I should move out.

24
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:32,452
If that's what you want.
When you get back, we'll discuss it.

25
00:01:32,535 --> 00:01:36,080
Now is as good a time as any.
That's fine with me. Goodbye.

26
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:37,499
Goodbye, Jessica.

27
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:45,882
Phil suggested that I...
Phil is just my lawyer, OK?

28
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:48,593
How did the Morse stock open
on the Nikkei?

29
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,303
I don't know.
You don't know?

30
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:53,890
Tokyo opened 90 minutes ago.
You have to keep on top of it.

31
00:01:54,015 --> 00:01:55,850
Hello, Mr Lewis.
How you doing?

32
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:58,978
I want this done as soon as possible.
I gotta get to New York.

33
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:00,563
I got tickets to The Met.

34
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:03,983
Your coat, Mr Lewis.
Thank you.

35
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:06,736
Edward.
Susan.

36
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,488
Hi.

37
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:11,491
I was sorry to hear about Carter.
Thanks.

38
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:14,160
I heard you got married.
Well...

39
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:17,580
Yeah, I couldn't wait for you.
Mm.

40
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:19,916
Tell me something.
Yes.

41
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,252
When you and I were dating,

42
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:25,338
did you speak to my secretary
more than you spoke to me?

43
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:28,007
She was
one of my bridesmaids.

44
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:29,551
Oh.

45
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:33,388
Your husband's
a lucky guy. Bye.

46
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:35,139
Thanks. Bye.

47
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:36,975
Do you?
Absolutely.

48
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,852
He's leaving.
Edward's leaving.

49
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:42,438
Excuse me.
Sure.

50
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:44,232
Is this Mr Stuckey's?

51
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:47,360
Where are you going?

52
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:50,863
You got the keys to your car?
What's wrong with the limo?

53
00:02:50,947 --> 00:02:53,491
The limo is buried.
Darryl can't get it out.

54
00:02:53,616 --> 00:02:56,619
Please give me the keys.
I don't think you should drive.

55
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:59,205
You're excited.
Don't drive my car.

56
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,875
What kind of a system is this?
Can you move these cars out of here?

57
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,627
Look, Edward... Edward.

58
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:07,046
Are you familiar
with a stick shift?

59
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,965
Yeah.
Just be ginger with it.

60
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,925
It's a new car.

61
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:12,885
I can do it.
Edward!

62
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:15,221
Give me a break, please.
I love this car.

63
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:19,392
I love it too. You don't know where
you're going. You're gonna get lost.

Carlos!

That was from way before.

Work out what?

Snack. Snack.

142
00:08:48,304 --> 00:08:51,766
Besides, it's my apartment.
I have to live there too.

00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:54,977

and a place to stay

144
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,188
and some valuable
vocational advice.

145
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:01,192

something, so don't irritate me.

Irritate you?

148
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:08,366
I just saw a girl
pulled out of a Dumpster.

149
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:12,745
I know, Skinny Marie.
But she was a flake.

150
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:16,290
She was a crackhead.
Dominic tried to straighten her out.

Get out of where?

This is our turf. We got seniority.
You better get off of our corner.

163
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:00,710
Forgive me.
I was just taking a rest.

164
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:03,546
Besides, she's new.
Yeah, well, I'm old.

165
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:06,382
So go rest up by Monty Hall
or Esther Wilson.

166
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:08,592
Williams.
Esther Williams.

167
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:12,179
Back off, Kit. You're really
becoming a grouch.

168
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:15,641
Am I really a grouch?
Yes.

169
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:19,270
Sometimes.
Well, just 'cause I'm hungry.

170
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,897
I'm gonna get something to eat.
Hey, girls!

171
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:26,277
Hey, yo, baby.
How about a freebie? It's my birthday.

172
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:27,737
Dream on.

173
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,575
It's looking
really slow tonight.

174
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:35,453
Yeah, well... Maybe we
should get a pimp, you know.

175
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:38,247
Carlos really digs you.

176
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:41,500
And then he'll run our lives
and take our money. No.

177
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:45,212
You're right. We say who,
we say when, we say how much.

178
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,550
Do you think I look
like Carol Channing?

179
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:52,386
I love this look.
It's very glamorous.

180
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,513
Glamour choice.

181
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:57,099
Oh, yo. Oh, yo.
Catch this.

182
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,771
Wait a minute.
That's a Lotus Esprit.

183
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:04,940
No, that's rent.

184
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:06,942
You should go for him.
You look hot.

185
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:10,780
Don't take less than 100. Call me
when you're through. Take care of you.

186
00:11:10,863 --> 00:11:12,406
Take care of you.

187
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:19,080
Work it. Work it, baby. Work it.

188
00:11:19,163 --> 00:11:21,832
Work it. Own it.

189
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:25,169
Yes, you can handle this.

190
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:27,129
First is here somewhere.

191
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:31,217
Hey, sugar,
you looking for a date?

192
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,803
No, Beverly Hills.
Can you give me directions?

193
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:36,514
Sure. For five bucks.

194
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:41,519
Ridiculous.
Price just went up to ten.

195
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:45,022
You can't charge me for directions.
I can do anything I want to.

196
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:46,816
I ain't lost.

197
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:53,239
All right. OK.

198
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:56,659
All right. You win. I lose.
Got change for a 20?

199
00:11:56,826 --> 00:11:58,911
For 20, I'll show you personal.

200
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:02,706
Show you where the stars live.
I've already been to Stallone's.

201
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,626
Right. Down the street.

202
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:09,672
Lights. Lights would be good.

203
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:13,509
This is a hot car.

204
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:15,636
It's a little temperamental.

205
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,805
Yours?
No, it isn't.

206
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:19,765
Stolen?
Not exactly.

207
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:21,350
What's your name?

208
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:25,020
What do you want it to be?

209
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,190
Vivian.

210
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:30,693
My name is Vivian.
Vivian.

211
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,654
So, what hotel you staying at?

212
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:37,533
The Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Down the block, right at the corner.

213
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:48,294
Man, this baby must corner
like it's on rails.

214
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:49,795
Beg your pardon?

215
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,215
Doesn't it blow your mind?
This is only four cylinders.

216
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:58,137
You know cars. Where's that from?
<i>Road & Track</i>.

217
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,308
Boys back home I grew up with
were really into Mustangs, Corvettes.

218
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:05,102
They bought 'em, fixed them up.
I paid attention.

219
00:13:05,227 --> 00:13:08,063
So, how is it you know
so little about cars?

220
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:10,399
My first car
was a limousine.

221
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:14,987
So, where is this...

222
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,281
...heavy metal home?

223
00:13:17,406 --> 00:13:20,117
Milledgeville, Georgia.

224
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:22,661
I think you left
your transmission back there.

225
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:25,247
You're not shifting right.
This is a standard H.

226
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,917
Standard H? Like I know
what that means.

227
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:31,295
You ever driven a Lotus?

228
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:33,088
No.

229
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:35,799
You're gonna start right now.
You're joking.

230
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,928
No, it's the only way
I can get you off my coat.

231
00:13:42,973 --> 00:13:46,435
Fasten your seat belt. I'm taking you
for the ride of your life.

232
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,395
I'll show you
what this car can do.

233
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:51,398
Are you ready?
Hang on. Here we go.

234
00:13:57,738 --> 00:14:00,824
This has pedals like a race car.
They're close together.

235
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:04,995
It's probably easier for a woman
to drive, 'cause they have little feet.

236
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:08,332
Except me.
I wear a size 9.

237
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:12,086
You know your foot's as big as your arm
from your elbow to your wrist?

238
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:15,714
Did you know that?
No, I didn't know that.

239
00:14:15,798 --> 00:14:17,841
It's a little bit of trivia.

240
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:25,641
Tell me, what kind of money
do you girls make these days?

241
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:29,270
Ballpark.
Can't take less $100.

242
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:33,774
Hundred dollars a night?
For an hour.

243
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:35,859
An hour?

244
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:37,361
You make $100 an hour,

245
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:40,489
and you got a safety pin
holding your boot up?

246
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:43,575
You gotta be joking.
I never joke about money.

247
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:44,868
Neither do I.

248
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:49,832
Hundred dollars an hour.
Pretty stiff.

249
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,755
Well, no, but it's
got potential.

250
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,276
Good evening, Mr Lewis.

251
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:21,280
Will you be needing the car tonight?
I hope not.

252
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:27,536
Ah, we're here.

253
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:29,204
Yeah.

254
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,252
So, you'll be all right?

255
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:39,006
Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab
with my 20 bucks.

256
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,342
Go back to your office.

257
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:44,887
Yeah.
My office. Yeah.

258
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:47,264
Well, thanks for the ride.

259
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:53,479
See you.
Goodbye.

260
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:08,118
No taxis?

261
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:11,997
No, I like the bus.

262
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,754
I was thinking, did you
really say $100 an hour?

263
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:20,631
Yeah.
Yeah.

264
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,344
Well, if you don't have
any prior engagements,

265
00:16:25,427 --> 00:16:27,763
I'd be very pleased
if you'd accompany me

266
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:30,641
into the hotel.
You got it.

267
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:37,439
What is your name?
Edward.

268
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:39,858
That's my favourite name
in the whole world.

269
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:41,193
No.

270
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:44,696
I tell you what, this is fate, Edward.
That's what this is.

271
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,867
Why don't you put this on?

272
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:51,703
Why?
Well...

273
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:53,705
This hotel is not an establishment

274
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:56,208
that rents rooms by the hour.

275
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,584
Ah.

276
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:04,299
Wow.

277
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,177
It's all right.

278
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:12,474
Holy shit.
You're gonna be fine.

279
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,144
Come with me.

280
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:16,937
And stop fidgeting.

281
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,772
Good evening, Mr Lewis.

282
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:21,150
Hello. You have messages?
Yes, several.

283
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:29,491
Could you send up
champagne and strawberries?

284
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:30,993
Of course.

285
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:33,829
Room service
for Mr Lewis, please.

286
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:46,508
Oh, honey.

287
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:50,262
You know what's happened?
I've got a runner in my pantyhose.

288
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:54,683
I'm not wearing pantyhose.

289
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,107
Well, colour me happy.
There's a sofa in here for two.

290
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,945
First time in an elevator.
Ah.

291
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,532
Close your mouth, dear.

292
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:15,787
Sorry. Couldn't help it.

293
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:17,831
Try.

294
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:25,464
Penthouse.

295
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:28,300
The penthouse. Ooh.
Yes.

296
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:31,303
To the left.

297
00:18:49,154 --> 00:18:50,822
I miss keys.

298
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,923
You impressed?

299
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:10,008
You kidding?
I come here all the time.

300
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:13,220
They do rent this by the hour.
Sure.

301
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:18,684
Wow. Great view.

302
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:21,603
I bet you can see all the way
to the ocean from out here.

303
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:24,147
I'll take your word for it.
I don't go out there.

304
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,191
Why don't you
go out there?

305
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:29,695
I'm afraid of heights.
You are?

306
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:31,863
How come you rented
the penthouse?

307
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:33,824
It's the best.

308
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:37,869
I looked for penthouses on
the first floor, but I can't find one.

309
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,583
Well, now that you
have me here,

310
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,626
what are you going
to do with me?

311
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,170
You want to know something?
I don't have a clue.

312
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:50,632
No?
I hadn't exactly planned this.

313
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,427
Well, do you plan everything?

314
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:55,470
Always.

315
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:57,264
Yeah, me too.

316
00:19:57,347 --> 00:20:00,601
I'm actually... No, I'm not
a planner. I wouldn't say I was.

317
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:04,730
I would say I was a kind of
fly by the seat of my pants gal.

318
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:07,316
You know, moment to moment.
That's me.

319
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:08,942
That's... Yeah.

320
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:16,450
You know, you could pay me.
That's one way to break the ice.

321
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:18,660
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

322
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:21,371
Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.

323
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:23,832
Cash works for me. Yeah.

324
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:33,717
You're on my fax.

325
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:37,387
Well, that's one
I haven't been on before.

326
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,517
Very cute. Thank you.

327
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:45,062
All right, here we go.

328
00:20:45,771 --> 00:20:47,773
Pick one.
I got red, green, yellow.

329
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:51,026
I'm out of purple, but I do have
one gold circle coin left.

330
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:53,278
The condom of champions,
the one and only.

331
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:56,365
Nothing is getting through
this sucker. What do you say?

332
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:59,576
A buffet of safety.
I'm a safety girl.

333
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:06,625
Let's get one of these on you.
No.

334
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:14,007
Why don't we talk
for a little bit.

335
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:15,676
Talk.

336
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,347
Yeah, um, OK.

337
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,643
Edward, are you in town
on business or pleasure?

338
00:21:24,726 --> 00:21:27,729
Business, I think.
Business, you think.

339
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:30,816
Well...

340
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,153
Let me guess.
That would make you...

341
00:21:35,237 --> 00:21:38,240
A lawyer.
A lawyer?

342
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:41,785
What makes you think
I'm a lawyer?

343
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:45,789
You've got that sharp
useless look about you.

344
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,502
I bet you've known
a lot of lawyers.

345
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:52,421
I've known a lot of everybody.

346
00:21:52,504 --> 00:21:56,216
What is that?

347
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:00,846
Champagne.
Oh.

348
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:04,433
Well, might as well
make myself useful.

349
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:07,060
Take a load off.

350
00:22:13,358 --> 00:22:15,318
Good evening.
Hi.

351
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:19,990
Where would you like it?

352
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:22,743
Where would we like it?
Over by the bar.

353
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,713
Excuse me.
It'll be on your bill, Mr Lewis.

354
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:36,757
Thank you.

355
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:41,803
What are you looking at?

356
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:44,973
What is he looking at?
Ah, yes.

357
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,058
Here you go.
Thank you very much.

358
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:49,186
Thank you, sir.
Have a nice night.

359
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:51,313
Tip. Wow.

360
00:22:51,396 --> 00:22:55,233
I missed that one.
Don't worry about it.

361
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:58,069
You mind if I take my boots off?
Not at all.

362
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:01,323
So, do you have a wife?
Girlfriend?

363
00:23:01,406 --> 00:23:03,867
I have both.
Where are they?

364
00:23:03,992 --> 00:23:06,661
Shopping together?

365
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:10,624
My ex-wife is now
in Long Island,

366
00:23:10,707 --> 00:23:13,835
in my ex-home
with my ex-dog.

367
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,049
There you go.

368
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:22,719
My ex-girlfriend, Jessica,
is in New York,

369
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:26,640
moving out of my apartment
even as we speak.

370
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:37,192
You should try a strawberry.
Why?

371
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:39,820
It brings out the flavour
in the champagne.

372
00:23:39,903 --> 00:23:41,863
Oh. Groovy.

373
00:23:50,205 --> 00:23:51,540
Pretty good.

374
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:57,045
Don't you drink?
No.

375
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:04,094
Listen, I-I appreciate this whole
seduction scene you got going,

376
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:05,887
but let me give you a tip.

377
00:24:05,971 --> 00:24:07,055
I'm a sure thing, OK?

378
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:09,933
I'm on an hourly rate.
Can we move it along?

379
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:13,478
I'm sensing that this time problem
IS a major issue with you.

380
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:16,523
Why don't we get through that now?
Let's get started.

381
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:19,276
How much for the entire night?

382
00:24:20,443 --> 00:24:22,404
Stay here?

383
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:27,158
You couldn't afford it.
Try me.

384
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:30,328
Three hundred dollars.
Done.

385
00:24:30,412 --> 00:24:33,665
Thank you.
Now we can relax.

386
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,094
I'll be out in a minute.
That champagne got to me.

387
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:49,806
What did you say?
I said I'd be out in just a minute.

388
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:54,227
What is... What do you have?
What are you hiding?

389
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:56,229
Nothing.

390
00:24:59,983 --> 00:25:02,360
All right, I do not want
any drugs here.

391
00:25:02,444 --> 00:25:05,238
I don't want this.
Get your money and please leave.

392
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:08,575
I don't do drugs. I stopped
doing drugs when I was 14.

393
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:10,785
What is this?

394
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:16,499
This is dental floss.
Yeah? So?

395
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,919
I had all those
strawberry seeds.

396
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:21,671
And you shouldn't
neglect your gums.

397
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:25,759
I'm sorry.
Please, continue.

398
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:27,928
Thank you.

399
00:25:33,683 --> 00:25:36,853
Are you gonna watch?
No, I'm going.

400
00:25:40,982 --> 00:25:42,317
Thank you.

401
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:47,864
It's just that, uh,
very few... people surprise me.

402
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:51,660
You're lucky. Most of them
shock the hell out of me.

403
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,999
You're watching.
I'm going.

404
00:26:13,348 --> 00:26:15,183
Yes, that may be true.

405
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:17,811
I still need the numbers

406
00:26:17,894 --> 00:26:20,647
on Morse Industries.

407
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,190
Uh-huh.

408
00:26:22,273 --> 00:26:24,859
I got them from London.
I need them from Tokyo.

409
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:27,278
I'll call down and get them
when I want them.

410
00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:29,114
Thank you very much.

411
00:26:30,782 --> 00:26:33,076
I have a little
carpet picnic here.

412
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:35,578
Are you sure you
don't want a drink?

413
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:38,498
I'm high on life.
Can't you tell?

414
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:52,220
You know,
I never saw this episode.

415
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:35,990
What do you want?

416
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:39,494
What do you do?
Everything.

417
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:42,789
But I don't kiss on the mouth.

418
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:45,542
Neither do I.

419
00:29:46,227 --> 00:29:48,730
Hey, how you doing?
Good, thank you.

420
00:29:48,813 --> 00:29:50,899
Good morning.
Morning, Mr Thompson.

421
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:53,026
Good morning.
Good morning, sir.

422
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:55,653
Morning, Mr Thompson.
Morning, Marjorie.

423
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:58,072
Morse is going to fight.
It's to be expected.

424
00:29:58,156 --> 00:30:00,074
He's run his company
for a long time.

425
00:30:00,158 --> 00:30:03,036
He's not ready to have
his name taken off the stationery.

426
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:05,371
He wants to meet you
face-to-face.

427
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:06,956
OK.
<i>I wouldn't do it.</i>

428
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,126
You wouldn't, but do it anyhow.
Tonight. Dinner.

429
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,129
Oh, Edward, it's really not
a good idea that you see him,

430
00:30:13,254 --> 00:30:14,964
definitely not alone.

431
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:16,466
He's a feisty old guy.

432
00:30:16,591 --> 00:30:19,093
We say the wrong thing,
we could wind up in court.

433
00:30:19,177 --> 00:30:21,888
There's always a possibility
things'll go wrong.

434
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:24,807
That's why I enjoy this so much.

435
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:28,394
By the way, Phil, about your car...
Oh, God, what?

436
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:30,521
It corners like it's on rails.

437
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:32,106
What? What does that mean?

438
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,900
<i>Edward? Edward?</i>

439
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:37,070
Hi.

440
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:40,615
Well, good morning.

441
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:42,742
Red.

442
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:44,702
Better.

443
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:49,832
You didn't wake me.
I can see you're really busy.

444
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:52,460
I'll be out in a minute.
There's no hurry.

445
00:30:53,378 --> 00:30:55,255
Are you hungry?
You must be.

446
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:57,966
Why don't you sit
and have something to eat?

447
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:01,302
I...

448
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:03,805
...took the liberty
of ordering everything.

449
00:31:03,888 --> 00:31:05,515
I didn't know
what you'd like.

450
00:31:06,182 --> 00:31:08,643
Thanks.
All right? Good.

451
00:31:13,648 --> 00:31:16,401
Did you sleep well?
Yeah. Too good.

452
00:31:16,484 --> 00:31:19,821
Forgot where I was.
Occupational hazard?

453
00:31:20,822 --> 00:31:22,407
Yeah.

454
00:31:22,782 --> 00:31:23,950
Did you sleep?

455
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:27,120
Uh, yes, a little
on the couch.

456
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:30,373
I was, uh, working last night.

457
00:31:30,498 --> 00:31:34,294
You don't sleep, you don't do drugs,
you don't drink.

458
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:37,338
You hardly eat.
What do you do, Edward?

459
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:40,341
'Cause I know you're not a lawyer.
That's right.

460
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:44,178
There are
four other chairs here.

461
00:31:45,263 --> 00:31:46,723
Oh.

462
00:31:51,853 --> 00:31:55,273
So, what do you do?
I buy companies.

463
00:31:55,356 --> 00:31:57,608
What kind of companies?

464
00:31:57,692 --> 00:32:02,447
Well, I buy companies that are
in financial difficulty.

465
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,949
If they have problems,
you must get a bargain.

466
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:07,618
Well, the company
I'm buying this week

467
00:32:07,702 --> 00:32:10,621
I'm getting for the bargain
price of about one billion.

468
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:15,501
A billion dollars?
Yes.

469
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:18,212
Wow. You must be
really smart, huh?

470
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:22,800
I only got through
eleventh grade.

471
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:26,763
How far did you go
in school?

472
00:32:26,888 --> 00:32:28,389
I went all the way.

473
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:35,229
Your folks must be
really proud, huh?

474
00:32:42,904 --> 00:32:44,655
So, you don't actually have

475
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:46,616
a billion dollars, huh?

476
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:50,286
No, I get some of it
from banks, investors.

477
00:32:50,411 --> 00:32:52,455
It's not an easy thing to do.

478
00:32:52,997 --> 00:32:56,084
You don't make anything and
you don't build anything?

479
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:59,879
What do you do with the companies?
I sell them.

480
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:02,131
Here, let me do that.
You sell them?

481
00:33:02,215 --> 00:33:05,134
Well, I don't sell
the whole company.

482
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:07,261
I break it up into pieces
and sell that.

483
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:11,099
If it's worth more than the whole.
So, it's like, um...

484
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:14,143
stealing cars and selling them
for the parts?

485
00:33:15,478 --> 00:33:18,064
Yeah, sort of. But legal.
Mm-hm.

486
00:33:18,773 --> 00:33:20,358
There. Now it's perfect.

487
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:24,278
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Where'd you learn to do that?

488
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:27,865
Well, I screwed
the debate team in high school.

489
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,327
I had a grandpa.
He was nice to me.

490
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:33,454
He liked ties on Sundays.

491
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:36,457
Mind if I take a swim
in your tub before I go?

492
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:39,293
Not at all. Just stay
in the shallow end.

493
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:46,134
<i>Hello?</i>
It's Phil. I wanted to let you know

495
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:51,639

00:33:51,722 --> 00:33:55,309
Oh, yes. A very intense

497

00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:08,633
More than life itself.
Don't you knock?

520
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:12,428
Vivian, I have a business
proposition for you.

521
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,389
What do you want?
I'm gonna be in town until Sunday.

522
00:35:15,473 --> 00:35:17,517
I'd like you
to spend the week with me.

523
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:22,146
Really?
Yes.

524
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,607
Yes, I'd like to hire you
as an employee.

525
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,985
Would you consider
spending the week with me?

526
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,989
I will pay you to be
at my beck and call.

527
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,619
I'd love to be your
"beck and call" girl, but...

528
00:35:36,744 --> 00:35:38,704
...you're a rich,
good-looking guy.

529
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:41,791
You could get
a million girls free.

530
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:43,501
I want a professional.

531
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:46,420
I don't need any
romantic hassles this week.

532
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:51,425
If you're talking 24 hours
a day, it's gonna cost you.

533
00:35:51,509 --> 00:35:54,303
Ohh. Yes, of course.

534
00:35:54,428 --> 00:35:57,056
All right. Here we go.

535
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:59,308
Give me a ballpark figure.
How much?

536
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:02,770
Six full nights.
Days too.

537
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:05,856
Four thousand.

538
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,526
Six nights at 300 is 1800.

539
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:09,944
You want days too.

540
00:36:10,027 --> 00:36:12,113
Two thousand.
Three thousand.

541
00:36:12,196 --> 00:36:15,157
Done.
Holy shit!

542
00:36:19,453 --> 00:36:21,414
Vivian.

543
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:23,874
Vivian, is that a yes?

544
00:36:26,502 --> 00:36:28,588
Yes.

545
00:36:29,297 --> 00:36:30,923
Yes!

546
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:34,051
I'll be gone most of the day.
I want you to buy some clothes.

547
00:36:34,135 --> 00:36:36,095
You should get
traveller's checks.

548
00:36:36,178 --> 00:36:38,848
We may be going out.
You'll need something to wear.

549
00:36:38,973 --> 00:36:42,101
Like what?
Nothing too flashy.

550
00:36:42,226 --> 00:36:45,271
Not too sexy. Conservative.
You understand?

551
00:36:45,354 --> 00:36:48,357
Boring.
Elegant.

552
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:51,277
Any questions?
Can I call you Eddie?

553
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,987
Not if you
expect me to answer.

554
00:36:53,112 --> 00:36:55,323
I would've stayed
for two thousand.

555
00:36:57,116 --> 00:36:59,952
I would've paid four.
I'll see you tonight.

556
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:01,996
Baby, I'm gonna
treat you so nice,

557
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,290
you're never gonna
want to let me go.

558
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:08,544
Three thousand for six days.

559
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:10,671
And, Vivian, I will let you go.

560
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,178
But I'm here now.

561
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:31,984
Three thousand dollars!

562
00:37:37,114 --> 00:37:39,075
Ooh.

563
00:37:44,372 --> 00:37:47,833
Hello.
I called and called. Where were you?

564
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,835
Ma?
<i>It's Viv.</i>

565
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:52,588
Oh, hi. I had to party.
Where are you?

566
00:37:52,713 --> 00:37:54,340
Oh, man,
are you ready for this?

567
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:56,384
The guy? The Lotus?

568
00:37:56,509 --> 00:37:59,845
I am in his hotel room
in Beverly Hills, the penthouse.

569
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:02,264
His bathroom is bigger
than the Blue Banana.

570
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,516
Do I have to hear this?

571
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:06,310
He wants me to stay
the whole week.

572
00:38:06,394 --> 00:38:09,230
You know what he's gonna
give me? You'll never guess.

573
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:12,650
<i>Three thousand dollars.</i>
Bullshit!

574
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:15,236
I swear to God,
and extra money to buy clothes.

575
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:18,739
Oh, man, I am bummed!
I gave that guy to you!

576
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:21,492
Three thousand. Really?
Is he twisted?

577
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:23,244
No.
<i>Ugly?</i>

578
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,496
He's good-looking.
<i>What's wrong?</i>

579
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,540
Nothing.
Did he give you the money?

580
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:30,042
<i>At the end of the week.</i>
That's what's wrong.

581
00:38:30,126 --> 00:38:33,838
Well, he gave me 300
for last night, and, Kit,

582
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:36,549
I'm gonna leave some
at the front desk for you.

583
00:38:36,632 --> 00:38:39,885
<i>I'm at the Regent Beverly
Wilshire. Write it down.</i>

584
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:43,013
<i>Are you writing it down?
You'll forget it. Write it down.</i>

585
00:38:43,097 --> 00:38:47,017
"Reg. Bev. Wil."

586
00:38:47,101 --> 00:38:50,771
One more thing. Where do I go
for the clothes? Good stuff, on him.

587
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,523
In Beverly Hills?
<i>Yeah.</i>

588
00:38:52,606 --> 00:38:55,151
Rodeo Drive, baby.

589
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:01,782
Hi.
Yes, ma'am. May I help you?

590
00:39:01,866 --> 00:39:05,077
I'm leavin' this here for Kit De Luca.
She's gonna pick it up.

591
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:07,705
Don't open that.
No, ma'am.

592
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:19,383

No, sir.

608
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:37,711
Are you looking for
something particular?

609
00:40:37,837 --> 00:40:39,505
No... Well, yeah.

610
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:41,882
Uh, something conservative.

611
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:44,051
Yes.

612
00:40:47,054 --> 00:40:49,139
You got nice stuff.
Thank you.

613
00:40:49,223 --> 00:40:52,560
How much is this?
I don't think this would fit you.

614
00:40:53,352 --> 00:40:56,772
Well. I didn't ask if it would fit.
I asked how much it was.

615
00:40:56,897 --> 00:40:58,816
How much is this, Marie?

616
00:40:58,899 --> 00:41:01,151
It's very expensive.

617
00:41:01,235 --> 00:41:03,070
It's very expensive.

618
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:05,489
Look, I got money
to spend in here.

619
00:41:05,573 --> 00:41:07,825
I don't think we have
anything for you.

620
00:41:07,908 --> 00:41:10,411
You're obviously
in the wrong place.

621
00:41:10,536 --> 00:41:12,788
Please leave.

622
00:41:41,108 --> 00:41:44,111
Tiffany's taking
the corner space.

623
00:41:44,194 --> 00:41:46,530
We're very excited about
the whole thing.

624
00:41:46,614 --> 00:41:49,074
Do you realise Via Rodeo
is the first new street

625
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,243
in Beverly Hills in 75 years?

626
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:55,873
Excuse me. May I help you?
I'm going to my room.

627
00:41:55,956 --> 00:41:59,209
Do you have a key?
I forgot that cardboard thing.

628
00:41:59,293 --> 00:42:02,379
I'm on the top floor.
You're a guest here?

629
00:42:02,463 --> 00:42:04,965
I'm with a friend.
Who would that be?

630
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:07,885
Edward.
Edward?

631
00:42:07,968 --> 00:42:10,137
Edward... uh...

632
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,559
He knows me.
Dennis.

633
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:18,228
Dennis, did you just
come off the night shift?

634
00:42:18,312 --> 00:42:21,690
Yes, sir.
Do you know this young lady?

635
00:42:21,815 --> 00:42:23,901
She's with Mr Lewis.
Mr Lewis?

636
00:42:23,984 --> 00:42:26,570
That's it. Edward Lewis.
Thanks, Dennis.

637
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:29,782
Evidently she joined him last night.
Thank you.

638
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:33,869
Oh, God, what now?
What? What?

639
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:36,789
What is with everybody?
Come with me and have a chat.

640
00:42:36,872 --> 00:42:38,874
I'm coming.
Thank you, Dennis.

641
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:42,086
What is your name, miss?
What do you want it to be?

642
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:45,381
Don't play with me, young lady.
Vivian.

643
00:42:45,464 --> 00:42:47,633
Thank you. Vivian.

644
00:42:47,716 --> 00:42:49,885
Well, Miss Vivian,

645
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,721
things that go on
in other hotels

646
00:42:52,805 --> 00:42:55,224
don't happen at
the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

647
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:58,060
Mr Lewis, however,
is a very special customer,

648
00:42:58,185 --> 00:43:01,355
and we like to think of our
special customers as friends.

649
00:43:01,438 --> 00:43:03,899
As a customer,
we would expect Mr Lewis

650
00:43:03,983 --> 00:43:06,151
to sign in
any additional guests,

651
00:43:06,235 --> 00:43:08,612
but as a friend,
we're willing to overlook it.

652
00:43:08,696 --> 00:43:11,699
Now, I'm assuming
that you're a...

653
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:14,576
...relative?

654
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,371
Yes.
I thought so.

655
00:43:17,496 --> 00:43:20,040
Then you must be his...

656
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:24,336
Niece?
Of course.

657
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,422
Naturally,
when Mr Lewis leaves,

658
00:43:26,547 --> 00:43:28,674
I won't see you
in this hotel again.

659
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:32,803
I assume you have
no other uncles here?

660
00:43:33,971 --> 00:43:36,140
Then we understand each other.

661
00:43:36,223 --> 00:43:38,892
I encourage you
to dress more appropriately.

662
00:43:38,976 --> 00:43:41,854
That will be all.
That's what I was trying to do.

663
00:43:41,937 --> 00:43:44,440
I tried to go get a dress
on Rodeo Drive today,

664
00:43:44,565 --> 00:43:46,358
and the women wouldn't help me.

665
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:48,986
I have all this money,
and no dress.

666
00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:50,946
Not that I expect your help,

667
00:43:51,071 --> 00:43:53,157
I have to buy a dress
for dinner tonight.

668
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,909
And nobody will help me.

669
00:44:08,255 --> 00:44:10,340
Oh, man, if you are calling
the cops...

670
00:44:10,424 --> 00:44:13,719
Yeah, call the cops. Great.
Tell them I said hi.

671
00:44:13,802 --> 00:44:15,179
Women's clothing.

672
00:44:16,472 --> 00:44:18,599
Bridget, please.

673
00:44:27,566 --> 00:44:29,902
Bridget, hello.
This is Barnard Thompson

674
00:44:29,985 --> 00:44:31,862
here at the Regent Beverly Wil...

675
00:44:33,363 --> 00:44:37,618
Thank you. Yes, but I'd like you
to do a favour for me, please.

676
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:40,454
I'm sending someone over.
Her name is Vivian.

677
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:42,664
She's a special guest.

678
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:46,418
She's the niece
of a very special guest.

679
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:49,713
This is the jewel
in Morse's crown.

680
00:44:49,797 --> 00:44:53,467
Prime industrial property
straddling Long Beach and Los Angeles.

681
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:55,385
Possibilities are endless.

682
00:44:55,469 --> 00:44:57,387
Most of the yard
we'll just level.

683
00:44:58,055 --> 00:45:01,850
I just got the information.
Edward, we just got the Morse update.

684
00:45:01,975 --> 00:45:04,144
Don, can you hold
the projection, please?

685
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:07,898
Yeah? What?
Speak.

686
00:45:07,981 --> 00:45:11,777
Old man Morse just got the inside track
on a $350 million contract

687
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,238
to build destroyers
for the navy.

688
00:45:14,321 --> 00:45:17,157
Navy contract.
I can't believe this.

689
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:19,827
I thought you said
they had nothing in the hopper.

690
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,746
I thought they didn't.
That could cost a lot more.

691
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,749
Stocks could go through the roof.
No shit, Sherlock.

692
00:45:25,874 --> 00:45:28,585
Maybe we're lucky to get
this information now, sir.

693
00:45:28,669 --> 00:45:31,171
We can still walk away.
Walk away?

694
00:45:31,255 --> 00:45:34,675
We got a thousand man-hours on this.
Nobody's walking away.

695
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,469
I think he's right.
I don't want to hear it!

696
00:45:37,553 --> 00:45:40,264
Gentlemen, relax. Relax.

697
00:45:40,347 --> 00:45:43,392
Who do we know on the Senate
Appropriations Committee?

698
00:45:43,517 --> 00:45:46,353
Senator Adams.
Senator Adams. Find out where he is.

699
00:45:46,436 --> 00:45:49,356
The navy's not going to spend
$350 million on anything

700
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,608
without going
to Appropriations first.

701
00:45:51,692 --> 00:45:54,027
I don't understand
what's going on.

702
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:56,655
That's why I hired you,
to do my worrying for me.

703
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,658
I'll be in your office.
Bob, send over the geologicals.

704
00:45:59,741 --> 00:46:01,118
No problem.
Thank you.

705
00:46:01,201 --> 00:46:04,371
Listen, everything all set
for the meeting tonight?

706
00:46:04,496 --> 00:46:08,041
Mm-hm.
Who is this girl you're going with?

707
00:46:09,209 --> 00:46:10,836
Nobody you know.

708
00:46:10,919 --> 00:46:13,130
Edward Lewis Enterprises.

709
00:46:13,213 --> 00:46:15,716
Phil Stuckey.
Yes, I have him right here.

710
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:18,802
Don't worry, Mrs Ramey.
I'll call you when it comes in.

711
00:46:18,886 --> 00:46:21,346
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

712
00:46:26,768 --> 00:46:29,688
Hello. You must be Vivian.
My name's Bridget.

713
00:46:29,771 --> 00:46:32,524
Yeah, hi. Barney said
you'd be nice to me.

714
00:46:32,649 --> 00:46:34,526
He's very sweet.

715
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:36,820
What are your plans
while you're in town?

716
00:46:36,904 --> 00:46:39,406
I'm gonna have dinner.
Don't sit there, dear.

717
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:41,742
You're gonna go out? Dinner?
Mm-hmm.

718
00:46:41,825 --> 00:46:44,953
You'll need a cocktail dress, then.
Come with me.

719
00:46:45,037 --> 00:46:48,081
I'm sure we'll find something
that your uncle would love.

720
00:46:48,165 --> 00:46:50,292
You're a size six, right?
Yeah.

721
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:53,003
How'd you know that?
That's my job.

722
00:46:53,086 --> 00:46:56,590
Bridge, he's not really my uncle.
They never are, dear.

723
00:47:01,428 --> 00:47:03,889
Barney. Sorry, mister.

724
00:47:03,972 --> 00:47:06,850
I got a dress.
I'd rather hoped you'd be wearing it.

725
00:47:06,934 --> 00:47:09,561
I didn't want to mess it up.
I got shoes. Wanna see?

726
00:47:09,645 --> 00:47:12,231
No, I'm sure they're
quite lovely. Thank you.

727
00:47:12,314 --> 00:47:14,775
I didn't mean to interrupt,
Bridget was great,

728
00:47:14,858 --> 00:47:17,694
and I wanted to say thanks.
You're cool.

729
00:47:17,778 --> 00:47:19,488
You're welcome, Miss Vivian.

730
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,373
Hello.
Never, ever pick up the phone.

731
00:47:29,456 --> 00:47:32,459
Why are you calling me?
<i>Did you buy clothes today?</i>

732
00:47:32,584 --> 00:47:35,254
I got a dress, a cocktail one.
<i>That's good.</i>

733
00:47:35,379 --> 00:47:37,965
I'll be in the hotel lobby
7:45 sharp.

734
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:41,510
<i>You're not coming to the door?</i>
This isn't a date. It's business.

735
00:47:41,635 --> 00:47:43,637
Where are you taking me?

736
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,806
To a restaurant
called the Voltaire.

737
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:48,267
<i>Very elegant.</i>
All right.

738
00:47:48,392 --> 00:47:51,395
I'll meet you in the lobby
'cause you're paying me to.

739
00:47:51,478 --> 00:47:53,814
Well, thank you very much.

740
00:47:56,149 --> 00:47:58,944
Get her back for me, please.

741
00:47:59,027 --> 00:48:00,737
Mr Stuckey wanted to see you.

742
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:04,783
Yes, tell him I'm in the middle
of an important phone call.

743
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,327
Hello.

744
00:48:07,411 --> 00:48:11,039
I told you not to pick up the phone.
Then stop calling me.

745
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:15,669
Sick.

746
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:19,506
Barney.

747
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:22,801
It didn't fit.
Oh, no, no, no.

748
00:48:22,884 --> 00:48:24,803
I've got a little problem.

749
00:48:24,886 --> 00:48:27,681
Right, Miss Vivian, one more time.
Dinner napkin.

750
00:48:27,806 --> 00:48:31,018
Dinner napkin,
laid gently in the lap.

751
00:48:31,143 --> 00:48:33,729
Good. Elbows off the table.

752
00:48:33,854 --> 00:48:35,939
Don't slouch.

753
00:48:36,023 --> 00:48:37,941
Shrimp fork.

754
00:48:38,066 --> 00:48:39,192
Salad fork.

755
00:48:39,318 --> 00:48:41,194
Dinner fork.

756
00:48:41,278 --> 00:48:42,863
I have the salad fork.

757
00:48:42,946 --> 00:48:45,782
The rest of the silverware
is a little confusing.

758
00:48:45,866 --> 00:48:48,327
If you get nervous,
just count the tines.

759
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:50,495
Four tines, dinner fork.

760
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:54,708
And sometimes there are three tines.
The salad fork.

761
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:55,876
And sometimes...

762
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:10,390
Pardon me, Mr Lewis.

763
00:49:10,474 --> 00:49:12,809
I'm Mr Thompson,
the manager of the hotel.

764
00:49:12,893 --> 00:49:14,227
I want to make one call.

765
00:49:14,353 --> 00:49:16,063
I have a message for you.

766
00:49:16,146 --> 00:49:19,316
From who?
From your niece, sir.

767
00:49:19,399 --> 00:49:20,484
My what?

768
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:23,070
The lady who's staying
with you in your room.

769
00:49:23,153 --> 00:49:24,905
Oh.

770
00:49:26,948 --> 00:49:29,743
We both know she's not my niece.
Of course.

771
00:49:29,868 --> 00:49:32,496
The reason I know that
is that I am an only child.

772
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:34,706
Yes, sir.

773
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,709
What's the message?
She's waiting in the lounge.

774
00:49:39,002 --> 00:49:42,464
Intriguing young lady,
Miss Vivian.

775
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:45,008
Intriguing.
Have a good evening, sir.

776
00:49:46,385 --> 00:49:48,762
Thank you, Mr...
Thompson. I'm the...

777
00:49:48,845 --> 00:49:51,765
...manager of the hotel, sir.

778
00:50:28,343 --> 00:50:30,137
You're late.

779
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,888
You're stunning.

780
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:33,974
You're forgiven.

781
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:38,186
Shall we go to dinner?

782
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:53,493
This way.
Your party's waiting.

783
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:55,036
Stop fidgeting.

784
00:50:58,123 --> 00:51:02,002
Mr Morse.
Yes, Mr Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.

785
00:51:02,085 --> 00:51:06,506
This fireball
is my grandson, David.

786
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,759
I don't know about fireball,
but grandson's true enough.

787
00:51:09,843 --> 00:51:12,554
I'm pleased to meet you both.
This is Vivian Ward.

788
00:51:13,221 --> 00:51:16,141
I'm glad to meet you.
Mr Morse. David.

789
00:51:16,224 --> 00:51:17,642
Please sit.

790
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,525
Excuse me.

791
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,112
Where are you going?

792
00:51:29,196 --> 00:51:30,947
I'm going to the ladies' room.

793
00:51:32,532 --> 00:51:35,285
Upstairs, to the right.
OK.

794
00:51:35,368 --> 00:51:36,870
Excuse me.

795
00:51:36,995 --> 00:51:39,039
Shall I order for you?
Yeah.

796
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,126
Please do so.
Thank you.

797
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:45,128
I'll do that.

798
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:56,848
My grandfather believes men who
create a company control its destiny.

799
00:51:56,932 --> 00:51:58,558
Where's the salad?

800
00:51:59,726 --> 00:52:02,312
The salad comes
at the end of the meal.

801
00:52:02,437 --> 00:52:04,064
But that's the fork I know.

802
00:52:06,566 --> 00:52:08,527
Let me
put it another way.

803
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:12,072
Between your public statements
and the rumours flying around,

804
00:52:12,197 --> 00:52:14,908
it's hard to figure out
what your intentions are.

805
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:18,828
I've never been able
to figure which goes with what.

806
00:52:35,178 --> 00:52:37,931
At one time we built
ships the size of cities.

807
00:52:38,056 --> 00:52:40,308
Men like my grandfather
made this country.

808
00:52:40,433 --> 00:52:42,727
Who ordered this?
The gentleman did.

809
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:45,230
Bon appetit.
These are <i>escargot</i>.

810
00:52:45,313 --> 00:52:48,692
It's French for snails.
It's a delicacy. Try it.

811
00:52:49,693 --> 00:52:52,571
David.
If you were to get control,

812
00:52:52,654 --> 00:52:54,864
and I don't think you will,
but if you did,

813
00:52:54,948 --> 00:52:57,784
what do you plan
to do with the company?

814
00:52:57,867 --> 00:52:59,869
Break it up
and sell off the pieces.

815
00:52:59,953 --> 00:53:02,872
I'm sure you'll understand
I'm not thrilled at the idea

816
00:53:02,956 --> 00:53:06,918
of your turning 40 years
of my work into your garage sale.

817
00:53:07,002 --> 00:53:09,045
At the price I'm paying
for this stock,

818
00:53:09,129 --> 00:53:12,632
you are going to be a very rich man.
I'm rich enough.

819
00:53:12,716 --> 00:53:15,302
I just want to have
my shipyard.

820
00:53:18,888 --> 00:53:20,682
Slippery little suckers.

821
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:24,519
It happens all the time.

822
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,065
I met your father.
What's his name?

823
00:53:30,817 --> 00:53:32,944
Carter.
Yeah, Carter.

824
00:53:33,028 --> 00:53:34,237
Carter Lewis.

825
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:37,365
He's not quite the bastard
everybody says he is.

826
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:40,785
No, I have the franchise on that.
Does that make him proud?

827
00:53:41,036 --> 00:53:43,038
I doubt it.

828
00:53:43,163 --> 00:53:45,665
It doesn't really matter now.
He passed away.

829
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:48,335
I hadn't heard. I'm sorry.

830
00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:50,295
I'm sorry too.

831
00:53:50,378 --> 00:53:52,881
Mr Morse, you asked
for this meeting.

832
00:53:53,006 --> 00:53:56,760
What can I do for you?
Leave my company alone.

833
00:53:56,843 --> 00:53:59,262
I can't do that.
I own ten million shares.

834
00:53:59,346 --> 00:54:02,140
I'll buy your stock back.
You don't have money.

835
00:54:02,223 --> 00:54:04,851
We're getting a contract
to build destroyers.

836
00:54:04,934 --> 00:54:08,438
There will be no contract.
It is now buried in Appropriations,

837
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:12,025
and it will remain there.
How did you pull that? Do you got...

838
00:54:12,108 --> 00:54:14,444
You got dirty politicians
in your pockets?

839
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,363
Easy.
Calm down, David.

840
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:20,700
Mr Lewis plays hardball.
Yes, I do.

841
00:54:20,784 --> 00:54:23,244
I've heard enough.
Vivian, it was a pleasure.

842
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:26,790
I'm sorry.
I've got to get some air.

843
00:54:26,873 --> 00:54:30,210
Mr Lewis.
I'd better join my grandson.

844
00:54:30,335 --> 00:54:33,922
You two enjoy your dinner.
I'm sure it will be delicious.

845
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:35,215
Good luck, miss.

846
00:54:36,049 --> 00:54:40,095
Watch out, Lewis.
I'm gonna tear you apart.

847
00:54:41,054 --> 00:54:43,348
I look forward to it, sir.

848
00:54:53,316 --> 00:54:55,610
Edward.

849
00:54:57,153 --> 00:54:59,364
You said you never
come out here.

850
00:55:00,532 --> 00:55:03,493
Well, I'm only halfway out.

851
00:55:03,576 --> 00:55:07,330
You didn't say much in the car
on the way home.

852
00:55:07,414 --> 00:55:09,416
You thinking about dinner?

853
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:11,000
I was a maniac.

854
00:55:11,084 --> 00:55:14,462
I mean, the business was good,
I think.

855
00:55:14,587 --> 00:55:17,924
He's in trouble.
You want his company.

856
00:55:18,007 --> 00:55:20,385
He doesn't want to let it go.

857
00:55:20,468 --> 00:55:22,262
Thanks for the recap.

858
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:26,349
Problem is,
I think you like Mr Morse.

859
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:29,686
I would like for you to get down.
You're making me nervous.

860
00:55:29,769 --> 00:55:31,479
It's making you nervous?

861
00:55:31,604 --> 00:55:35,191
What if I just lean back like this?
Would you rescue me if I fell?

862
00:55:35,275 --> 00:55:37,277
Vivian, I'm serious.
I'm not looking.

863
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,779
It's really high.
Look, no hands. No hands.

864
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:43,158
OK. All right, I'm sorry.

865
00:55:43,658 --> 00:55:45,660
The truth is,

866
00:55:45,744 --> 00:55:49,122
it really is totally irrelevant
whether I like this man or not.

867
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,584
I will not let myself become
emotionally involved in business.

868
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:57,172
I know.
Kit's always saying to me,

869
00:55:57,255 --> 00:55:59,591
"Don't get emotional
when you turn tricks."

870
00:55:59,674 --> 00:56:02,427
That's why no kissing.
It's too personal.

871
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:05,472
Like what you're saying.
Stay numb, don't get involved.

872
00:56:05,597 --> 00:56:08,808
When I'm with a guy,
I'm like a robot. I just do it.

873
00:56:14,481 --> 00:56:17,192
I mean... except with you.

874
00:56:17,317 --> 00:56:18,818
Of course, not with me.

875
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:25,074
You and I are such
similar creatures, Vivian.

876
00:56:25,158 --> 00:56:27,494
We both screw people for money.

877
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:35,668
I'm sorry to hear
about your dad.

878
00:56:36,836 --> 00:56:39,380
When did he die?
Last month.

879
00:56:41,549 --> 00:56:43,176
Do you miss him?

880
00:56:45,345 --> 00:56:49,182
I hadn't spoken to him
in 14 and a half years.

881
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:53,353
I wasn't there when he died.

882
00:56:53,436 --> 00:56:55,939
Do you want to talk about this?
No.

883
00:56:56,022 --> 00:56:57,941
Well, I'll tell you what.

884
00:56:58,066 --> 00:57:00,610
"Cause I got an idea.

885
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:02,946
Let's watch old movies all night.

886
00:57:03,029 --> 00:57:05,949
We'll just veg out
in front of the TV.

887
00:57:06,032 --> 00:57:08,201
"Veg out"?
Yeah.

888
00:57:08,326 --> 00:57:10,912
Be still like vegetables.
Lay like broccoli.

889
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,708
I'll tell you what.
I'll be back.

890
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:18,419
We'll do broccoli tomorrow.

891
00:57:19,879 --> 00:57:22,882
Where are you going?
Downstairs for awhile.

892
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:28,054
<i>Did you say marriage license?</i>

893
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:30,765
<i>Don't change the subject.
Just give me the stamp.</i>

894
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:34,310
<i>Oh, I love you, Adam,
Alex, Peter, Brian,</i>

895
00:57:34,394 --> 00:57:35,728
<i>whatever your name is.</i>

896
00:57:35,812 --> 00:57:38,565
<i>Oh, I love you.</i>

897
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:53,955
Hi. I'm in the penthouse.
The guy that was here...

898
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,166
<i>Mr Lewis? Have you
seen him down there anywhere?</i>

899
00:58:37,582 --> 00:58:39,250
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

900
00:58:40,293 --> 00:58:42,629
I didn't know you played.

901
00:58:42,712 --> 00:58:44,422
I only play for strangers.

902
00:58:45,465 --> 00:58:48,259
I was getting lonely upstairs,
all by myself.

903
00:58:53,514 --> 00:58:55,642
Gentlemen?

904
00:58:55,725 --> 00:58:57,602
Would you mind
leaving us, please?

905
00:59:00,563 --> 00:59:02,482
Thank you.

906
00:59:04,734 --> 00:59:07,570
People always do
what you tell them to do?

907
00:59:38,726 --> 00:59:41,062
I guess so.

908
01:00:39,912 --> 01:00:41,748
Wake up.
Time to shop.

909
01:00:45,001 --> 01:00:48,588
If you have any trouble using this card,
have them call the hotel.

910
01:00:48,671 --> 01:00:51,549
All right?

911
01:00:51,632 --> 01:00:55,428
More shopping?
Mm-hm.

912
01:00:55,553 --> 01:00:59,599
I'm surprised you didn't buy
more than one dress yesterday.

913
01:00:59,724 --> 01:01:01,934
It wasn't as much fun
as I thought it'd be.

914
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:05,396
Why not?
They were mean to me.

915
01:01:06,272 --> 01:01:08,858
Mean to you?

916
01:01:10,943 --> 01:01:12,779
People are looking at me.

917
01:01:12,945 --> 01:01:15,573
They're not looking at you.
They're looking at me.

918
01:01:15,656 --> 01:01:18,076
Stores are not nice to people.
I don't like it.

919
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:21,454
Stores are never nice to people.
They're nice to credit cards.

920
01:01:22,914 --> 01:01:25,541
OK. Stop fidgeting.

921
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:27,168
Get rid of your gum.

922
01:01:29,629 --> 01:01:31,672
I don't believe you did that.

923
01:01:34,008 --> 01:01:37,512
I am Mr Hollister, the manager.
May I help you?

924
01:01:37,595 --> 01:01:39,597
Edward Lewis.
Yes, sir.

925
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,351
You see this young lady over there?
Yes.

926
01:01:43,434 --> 01:01:46,354
Do you have anything in this shop
as beautiful as she is?

927
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:48,106
Oh, yes.

928
01:01:48,189 --> 01:01:49,649
Oh, no.
No, no.

929
01:01:49,732 --> 01:01:52,485
I'm saying we have many things
as beautiful as she...

930
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:54,654
...would want them.
That's the point.

931
01:01:54,737 --> 01:01:56,906
I think we can all
agree with that.

932
01:01:56,989 --> 01:01:58,908
You know what we're
gonna need here?

933
01:01:58,991 --> 01:02:02,411
We're gonna need more people helping us.
I'll tell you why.

934
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:06,040
We are going to be spending
an obscene amount of money in here.

935
01:02:06,124 --> 01:02:08,668
We're gonna need a lot
more help sucking up to us,

936
01:02:08,751 --> 01:02:10,586
'cause that's what
we really like.

937
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:14,382
Sir, if I may say so, you're in
the right store, and the right city.

938
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:16,175
Anything you see here we can do.

939
01:02:16,259 --> 01:02:17,802
Get ready to have fun.
OK.

940
01:02:17,885 --> 01:02:20,721
Mary Pat, Mary Kate,
Mary Francis, let's see it.

941
01:02:20,805 --> 01:02:22,765
This is absolutely divine.

942
01:02:22,849 --> 01:02:24,600
Excuse me, sir.

943
01:02:24,684 --> 01:02:28,187
Exactly how obscene an amount
of money were you talking about?

944
01:02:28,271 --> 01:02:30,773
Profane, or really offensive?

945
01:02:30,857 --> 01:02:33,526
Really offensive.
I like him so much.

946
01:02:50,501 --> 01:02:52,628
Mr Lewis, sir.
How's it going so far?

947
01:02:52,712 --> 01:02:56,507
Pretty well, I think.
I think we need some major sucking up.

948
01:02:57,258 --> 01:02:59,302
Very well, sir.

949
01:02:59,385 --> 01:03:01,304
You're handsome
and powerful.

950
01:03:01,387 --> 01:03:03,890
I could see you were
someone to reckon with...

951
01:03:03,973 --> 01:03:05,641
Hollister?
Yes, sir?

952
01:03:05,725 --> 01:03:07,852
Not me. Her.

953
01:03:07,935 --> 01:03:10,897
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry.

954
01:03:11,063 --> 01:03:12,356
How are we doing, ladies?

955
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,568
Edward, where are you?
The word's all over the street.

956
01:03:15,693 --> 01:03:18,571
<i>Morse is gonna raise your offer.</i>
He's countering?

957
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:20,740
God, he is a tough old bird.

958
01:03:20,865 --> 01:03:23,534
<i>Contracts are stalled.
Where's he getting money?</i>

959
01:03:23,618 --> 01:03:25,953
I think he's throwing in
with the employees.

960
01:03:26,037 --> 01:03:28,372
He needs someone
to underwrite the paper.

961
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:30,166
<i>Find out.
I'll be in in an hour.</i>

962
01:03:30,249 --> 01:03:32,501
OK. You got it.
You're on your own.

963
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:35,171
I have to go back to work.
You look great.

964
01:03:35,254 --> 01:03:38,341
She has my card.
And we'll help her use it, sir.

965
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:45,014

Mr Lewis.
Gentlemen.

996
01:05:25,323 --> 01:05:27,116
Let's finish this afternoon.

997
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:29,035
Jake, set something up
with Blair.

998
01:05:29,118 --> 01:05:31,704
2:00, 2:30 would be good.

999
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:33,581
You were right about Morse.

1000
01:05:33,664 --> 01:05:35,791
He mortgaged everything he owns

1001
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:38,044
to secure a loan
from the bank.

1002
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:41,088
And not just any bank.
Plymouth Trust.

1003
01:05:41,213 --> 01:05:43,716
Mm.
So, it goes without saying,

1004
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:46,135
your business means
more to them than Morse.

1005
01:05:46,218 --> 01:05:48,596
All you gotta do
is call the bank.

1006
01:05:52,475 --> 01:05:54,018
Yeah.

1007
01:05:58,272 --> 01:06:00,149
Edward, excuse me
for saying this,

1008
01:06:00,232 --> 01:06:02,360
but what is wrong
with you this week?

1009
01:06:02,443 --> 01:06:05,863
Are you giving Morse
a chance to get away?

1010
01:06:05,946 --> 01:06:09,158
You know what I used to love
when I was a kid, Phil?

1011
01:06:11,285 --> 01:06:13,621
What?

1012
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:15,247
Blocks.

1013
01:06:17,124 --> 01:06:19,543
Building blocks.
Erector sets.

1014
01:06:19,627 --> 01:06:22,505
So, I liked Monopoly.
Boardwalk, Park Place...

1015
01:06:22,588 --> 01:06:25,674
What's the point?
We don't build anything.

1016
01:06:25,758 --> 01:06:27,676
We don't make anything.

1017
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,554
We make money, Edward.

1018
01:06:30,638 --> 01:06:33,766
We worked for a year on this.
It's what you said you wanted.

1019
01:06:33,849 --> 01:06:35,101
I'm handing it to you.

1020
01:06:36,268 --> 01:06:38,604
Morse's jugular is exposed.

1021
01:06:38,771 --> 01:06:41,982
It's time for the kill.
Let's finish this.

1022
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:44,735
Call the bank.

1023
01:07:05,423 --> 01:07:07,633
How was your day, dear?

1024
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:13,139
Nice tie.

1025
01:07:13,222 --> 01:07:15,349
I got it for you.

1026
01:07:17,476 --> 01:07:19,979
Well, my mother
was a music teacher...

1027
01:07:20,104 --> 01:07:22,356
...and married my father,

1028
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,109
whose family was
extremely wealthy.

1029
01:07:25,192 --> 01:07:28,154
Then he divorced my mother
to be with another woman.

1030
01:07:29,238 --> 01:07:31,198
And he took his money with him.

1031
01:07:32,825 --> 01:07:35,119
And then she died.

1032
01:07:35,202 --> 01:07:37,329
I was very angry with him.

1033
01:07:37,413 --> 01:07:40,249
It cost me $10,000 in therapy
to say that sentence:

1034
01:07:40,332 --> 01:07:42,001
"I was very angry with him."

1035
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:44,795
I do it well, don't I?
I'll say it again. I was angry.

1036
01:07:44,879 --> 01:07:48,174
Hello, my name is Mr Lewis.
I am very angry with my father.

1037
01:07:48,257 --> 01:07:50,843
I would've been angry
at the $10,000.

1038
01:07:52,678 --> 01:07:55,764
My father was president

1039
01:07:55,848 --> 01:07:59,643
of the third company
I ever took over.

1040
01:07:59,727 --> 01:08:03,689
I bought it. I sold it off,
piece by piece.

1041
01:08:03,772 --> 01:08:05,900
What did the shrink say?

1042
01:08:05,983 --> 01:08:07,735
Said I was cured.

1043
01:08:07,818 --> 01:08:10,988
Well, so you got even.
That must've made you happy.

1044
01:08:16,785 --> 01:08:20,831
Did I mention my leg
is 44 inches from hip to toe?

1045
01:08:20,915 --> 01:08:23,209
So basically,
we're talking about

1046
01:08:23,292 --> 01:08:26,795
88 inches of therapy

1047
01:08:26,879 --> 01:08:29,715
wrapped around you
for the bargain price...

1048
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:32,676
...of $3,000.
$3,000.

1049
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,762
Yeah.

1050
01:08:37,598 --> 01:08:40,184
<i>Garbers passes to Keenan.</i>

1051
01:08:40,267 --> 01:08:41,560
<i>This is Phil Fricker</i>

1052
01:08:41,644 --> 01:08:43,896
<i>giving you play-by-play
of this event.</i>

1053
01:08:44,021 --> 01:08:47,733
Watch where you walk, if you step
in something, we're not going back.

1054
01:08:47,816 --> 01:08:50,694
And not near the tree.
I don't like the ants. Hello.

1055
01:08:50,778 --> 01:08:53,322
Have you seen Edward anywhere?

1056
01:08:53,405 --> 01:08:55,824
What if someone recognises me?
Not likely.

1057
01:08:55,908 --> 01:08:58,744
They don't spend time
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1058
01:08:58,827 --> 01:09:00,746
Come on.
Let go. Let go.

1059
01:09:00,829 --> 01:09:04,041
All right. You look great.
You look like a lady.

1060
01:09:04,124 --> 01:09:05,918
We're gonna have
a wonderful time.

1061
01:09:07,753 --> 01:09:11,257
OK, don't fidget.
And smile.

1062
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:14,260
<i>...coming around the side.</i>

1063
01:09:14,343 --> 01:09:15,886
<i>Penalty on that play.</i>

1064
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:19,348
This is Gwen and Gretchen,
the infamous Olsen sisters,

1065
01:09:19,431 --> 01:09:21,767
who have made marrying well
an art form.

1066
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:23,769
Edward.
Wait just a sec.

1067
01:09:23,894 --> 01:09:26,939
So, you're the flavour
of the month.

1068
01:09:27,022 --> 01:09:29,275
Uh, she's just being testy.

1069
01:09:29,358 --> 01:09:31,569
Edward's our most
eligible bachelor.

1070
01:09:31,652 --> 01:09:34,405
Everybody is trying to land him.
I'm not trying to.

1071
01:09:34,488 --> 01:09:36,615
I'm just using him for sex.

1072
01:09:41,287 --> 01:09:43,789
Well done.
Well done!

1073
01:09:43,872 --> 01:09:45,207
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

1074
01:09:47,126 --> 01:09:49,628
Tell me again
why we're here.

1075
01:09:49,712 --> 01:09:51,797
Business.
Business mingling?

1076
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,633
Yeah.

1077
01:09:54,717 --> 01:09:58,804
<i>That's the chukker, ladies and
gentlemen. Falcons 7, Gems 4.</i>

1078
01:09:58,929 --> 01:10:01,098
Excuse me. Edward! Edward.

1079
01:10:01,181 --> 01:10:03,726
Over here.
Phil.

1080
01:10:03,809 --> 01:10:07,062
Good to see you.
I want you to meet a friend, Vivian.

1081
01:10:07,146 --> 01:10:09,690
Hi. Philip Stuckey.
This is my wife, Elizabeth.

1082
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:12,776
It's always a pleasure
meeting one of Edward's girls.

1083
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:15,279
Oh, my God.
It's Tate Whitley Wallington.

1084
01:10:15,362 --> 01:10:19,783
Tate. It's me, Elizabeth,
from Work Out World.

1085
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:22,077
She's a bit
of an aerobics queen.

1086
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:23,912
Feel the burn.

1087
01:10:23,996 --> 01:10:27,207
Let me get you a drink.
Vivian, why don't you start with that?

1088
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:29,752
I'll be right back.
Senator Adams is here.

1089
01:10:29,835 --> 01:10:31,754
Mm-hm. I asked him.

1090
01:10:31,837 --> 01:10:34,840
That is why I have pledged
my eternal love to you.

1091
01:10:36,717 --> 01:10:39,011
Real genuine guy.
Who is he?

1092
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,222
He's my lawyer.
He's all right.

1093
01:10:42,348 --> 01:10:44,433
You could freeze ice
on his wife's ass.

1094
01:10:44,516 --> 01:10:46,310
We'll try that later.

1095
01:10:46,393 --> 01:10:49,813
Are these people your friends?
I spend time with them, yeah.

1096
01:10:49,897 --> 01:10:51,774
Well, no wonder.

1097
01:10:51,857 --> 01:10:53,567
No wonder what?

1098
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:56,904
No wonder why you
came looking for me.

1099
01:10:57,029 --> 01:11:00,157
I need help from you ladies
and gentlemen in the audience.

1100
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:03,202
<i>We need help replacing
some divots here on the grass.</i>

1101
01:11:03,369 --> 01:11:05,037
<i>So, come on out now.</i>

1102
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,872
<i>Come on, come on, folks.</i>

1103
01:11:06,955 --> 01:11:09,416
<i>You heard her.
The stomping of the divots.</i>

1104
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,127
<i>This is
a time-honoured tradition.</i>

1105
01:11:12,211 --> 01:11:14,630
<i>As old as the game
of polo itself.</i>

1106
01:11:14,713 --> 01:11:17,132
<i>Kings and queens
used to do this.</i>

1107
01:11:19,385 --> 01:11:21,053
She's sweet, Edward.

1108
01:11:21,136 --> 01:11:23,430
Wherever did you find her?

1109
01:11:28,519 --> 01:11:30,646
<i>Only one word of advice.</i>

1110
01:11:30,729 --> 01:11:33,774
<i>Avoid the steaming divot.</i>

1111
01:11:40,072 --> 01:11:42,574
It's all part of
the game of polo.

1112
01:11:42,658 --> 01:11:45,202
Your shoes are polished
by a member of the club.

1113
01:11:45,285 --> 01:11:48,038
I've got something that'll buff that.
Thank you.

1114
01:11:49,456 --> 01:11:52,876
Vivian. Hi, David Morse.
Excuse me.

1115
01:11:54,253 --> 01:11:55,796
David.
How are you?

1116
01:11:55,879 --> 01:11:57,673
I'm OK.
I thought that was you.

1117
01:11:57,756 --> 01:11:59,800
I like this hat.
It's new.

1118
01:11:59,925 --> 01:12:02,428
Come meet my horse, Vivian.

1119
01:12:02,511 --> 01:12:04,680
Edward's waiting for me.
I don't want...

1120
01:12:04,763 --> 01:12:07,141
He's right here.
OK, just for a second.

1121
01:12:07,224 --> 01:12:09,768
I didn't know
you were playing today.

1122
01:12:09,852 --> 01:12:13,188
I was asking for directions.
There she was.

1123
01:12:13,272 --> 01:12:15,524
So, you just ran into her?
That's great.

1124
01:12:15,607 --> 01:12:18,110
So, what does she do?
Does she work?

1125
01:12:20,404 --> 01:12:23,407
She's in sales.
That's terrific. That's good.

1126
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:25,909
What does she sell?

1127
01:12:26,994 --> 01:12:28,579
Why do you want to know?

1128
01:12:30,164 --> 01:12:33,834
Just hear me out on this, OK?
I've known you a long time.

1129
01:12:33,959 --> 01:12:38,046
I see some differences in you
this week, like the tie...

1130
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,549
I'm wondering if this girl
is the difference.

1131
01:12:40,632 --> 01:12:43,218
Especially when I see her
talking to David Morse.

1132
01:12:47,931 --> 01:12:50,184
I introduced them
the other night.

1133
01:12:50,267 --> 01:12:52,060
So now they're best friends?

1134
01:12:52,144 --> 01:12:55,397
This girl appears from nowhere.
Now she's talking to this guy.

1135
01:12:55,481 --> 01:12:58,150
That's a little convenient,
don't you think?

1136
01:12:58,233 --> 01:13:00,819
How do you know she hasn't
attached herself to you

1137
01:13:00,903 --> 01:13:02,988
and is bringing
information to Morse?

1138
01:13:03,071 --> 01:13:05,866
This happens. Industrial espionage.
Phil, Phil.

1139
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:09,036
Listen to me.
She's not a spy.

1140
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,663
She is a hooker.

1141
01:13:11,747 --> 01:13:14,082
She is a hooker.

1142
01:13:15,751 --> 01:13:18,337
I picked her up
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1143
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:19,838
In your car.

1144
01:13:25,928 --> 01:13:27,513
Yes.

1145
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,892
You're the only millionaire
I've heard of

1146
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:34,269
who's looking
for a bargain streetwalker.

1147
01:13:34,353 --> 01:13:37,940
Edward.
I'm sorry I told you.

1148
01:13:38,023 --> 01:13:41,819
Senator. Senator Adams,
I'm pleased you could make it.

1149
01:13:41,902 --> 01:13:44,363
I hope the information
I gave you was helpful.

1150
01:13:44,446 --> 01:13:46,365
Absolutely.

1151
01:13:46,448 --> 01:13:48,992
No change?
No, it's still bogged down.

1152
01:13:52,162 --> 01:13:55,874
Having a nice time, Vivian?
Yeah, I'm having a great time.

1153
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:58,710
Must be quite a change
from Hollywood Boulevard.

1154
01:14:00,462 --> 01:14:02,047
What?

1155
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:04,132
Edward told me.

1156
01:14:04,216 --> 01:14:06,969
Don't worry. Your secret
is safe with me.

1157
01:14:08,136 --> 01:14:10,681
Listen, maybe...

1158
01:14:10,764 --> 01:14:14,560
...you and I could get together
sometime after Edward leaves.

1159
01:14:16,103 --> 01:14:17,604
Yeah, sure.

1160
01:14:17,688 --> 01:14:19,356
Why not?

1161
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:21,900
We'll just have to do that, hmm?

1162
01:14:22,067 --> 01:14:23,694
Philip.

1163
01:14:27,072 --> 01:14:30,492
<i>I'd like to mention
a couple of our silver sponsors,</i>

1164
01:14:30,576 --> 01:14:33,328
<i>Jacobs Distributors,
Norell Saddlery,</i>

1165
01:14:33,412 --> 01:14:36,582
<i>and we'd like to give a big thanks
to our platinum sponsor,</i>

1166
01:14:36,665 --> 01:14:39,543
<i>Edward Lewis Enterprises.</i>

1167
01:14:41,128 --> 01:14:43,839
<i>The ball is in
for chukker number four.</i>

1168
01:14:48,093 --> 01:14:49,928
Ai ..

1169
01:14:52,306 --> 01:14:54,892
You all right?
I'm fine.

1170
01:14:54,975 --> 01:14:56,685
Fine? That's good.

1171
01:14:56,768 --> 01:14:59,313
Seven "fines" since
we left the match.

1172
01:14:59,396 --> 01:15:01,231
Could I have
another word, please?

1173
01:15:01,315 --> 01:15:03,442
Asshole. There's a word.

1174
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:06,612
I think I liked "fine" better.

1175
01:15:06,695 --> 01:15:08,572
Just tell me one thing.

1176
01:15:08,655 --> 01:15:10,949
Why'd you make me
get all dressed up?

1177
01:15:11,033 --> 01:15:13,452
For one thing,
the clothing was appropriate.

1178
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:17,456
No. What I mean is, if you were gonna
tell everybody I'm a hooker,

1179
01:15:17,539 --> 01:15:20,250
why didn't you let me wear my clothes?
I did not...

1180
01:15:20,334 --> 01:15:23,420
In my own clothes, when someone
like Stuckey comes up to me,

1181
01:15:23,503 --> 01:15:26,006
I can handle it,
I'm prepared.

1182
01:15:26,089 --> 01:15:29,009
I'm very sorry. I'm not happy
with Stuckey at all

1183
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:31,011
for saying that or doing that.

1184
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:33,805
But he is my attorney.
I've known him for ten years.

1185
01:15:33,889 --> 01:15:37,142
He thought you were an industrial spy.
The guy's paranoid.

1186
01:15:37,225 --> 01:15:38,977
Are you my pimp now?

1187
01:15:39,061 --> 01:15:42,356
You think you can pass me around
your friends? I'm not some toy.

1188
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:44,483
You're not my toy.
I know you're not...

1189
01:15:44,566 --> 01:15:47,778
Vivian! Vivian, I'm speaking
to you. Come back here.

1190
01:15:47,861 --> 01:15:50,656
I hate to point out the obvious,
but you are a hooker.

1191
01:15:50,739 --> 01:15:53,367
You are my employee.
You don't own me. I decide.

1192
01:15:53,492 --> 01:15:56,244
I say who, I say when,
I say who!

1193
01:15:56,328 --> 01:15:58,914
I refuse to spend the next days
fighting with you.

1194
01:15:58,997 --> 01:16:00,332
I said I was sorry.

1195
01:16:00,415 --> 01:16:02,209
That's the end of it.

1196
01:16:03,418 --> 01:16:05,128
I'm sorry I ever met you.

1197
01:16:06,755 --> 01:16:08,715
I'm sorry
I got into your stupid car.

1198
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:11,927
As if you had so many more
appealing options.

1199
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:18,350
I've never had anyone make me
feel as cheap as you did today.

1200
01:16:18,433 --> 01:16:21,478
Somehow I find that
very hard to believe.

1201
01:16:29,611 --> 01:16:31,238
Where are you going?

1202
01:16:31,321 --> 01:16:33,573
I want my money.
I want to get out of here.

1203
01:17:21,246 --> 01:17:22,748
Come on.

1204
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:36,303
I'm sorry.

1205
01:17:38,263 --> 01:17:42,392
I wasn't prepared to answer
questions about us.

1206
01:17:44,394 --> 01:17:47,189
That was stupid and cruel.

1207
01:17:48,273 --> 01:17:49,858
I didn't mean it.

1208
01:17:50,942 --> 01:17:53,153
I don't want you to go.

1209
01:17:53,278 --> 01:17:55,238
Will you stay the week?

1210
01:17:55,655 --> 01:17:57,199
Why?

1211
01:17:59,326 --> 01:18:01,620
I saw you talking
to David Morse.

1212
01:18:02,621 --> 01:18:04,206
I didn't like it.

1213
01:18:04,289 --> 01:18:06,750
We were just talking.

1214
01:18:10,128 --> 01:18:12,255
I didn't like it.

1215
01:18:15,092 --> 01:18:16,468
Down?

1216
01:18:29,564 --> 01:18:31,358
You hurt me.

1217
01:18:32,984 --> 01:18:34,653
Yes.

1218
01:18:35,987 --> 01:18:38,448
Don't do it again.

1219
01:19:00,345 --> 01:19:04,266
The first guy I ever loved
was a total nothing.

1220
01:19:04,349 --> 01:19:06,393
The second was worse.

1221
01:19:06,518 --> 01:19:08,562
My mom called me
a "bum magnet.”

1222
01:19:08,645 --> 01:19:10,438
If there was a bum
within 50 miles,

1223
01:19:10,522 --> 01:19:12,983
I was completely attracted to him.

1224
01:19:13,066 --> 01:19:16,653
That's how I ended up here.
I followed bum number three.

1225
01:19:16,736 --> 01:19:18,697
Mm.

1226
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:21,491
So, here I was.
No money, no friends.

1227
01:19:21,575 --> 01:19:23,326
No bum.

1228
01:19:26,454 --> 01:19:30,250
And you chose this
as your profession?

1229
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:32,752
I worked at a couple
of fast food places.

1230
01:19:33,378 --> 01:19:36,256
Parked cars at wrestling.

1231
01:19:36,339 --> 01:19:40,051
I couldn't make the rent.
I was too ashamed to go home.

1232
01:19:40,552 --> 01:19:42,721
That's when I met Kit.

1233
01:19:42,804 --> 01:19:46,600
She was a hooker
and made it sound so great.

1234
01:19:46,683 --> 01:19:48,768
So one day I did it.

1235
01:19:50,395 --> 01:19:52,689
And I cried
the whole time.

1236
01:19:55,275 --> 01:19:57,194
But then I got
some regulars, and...

1237
01:19:57,277 --> 01:19:59,571
You know, it's not like
anybody plans this.

1238
01:19:59,654 --> 01:20:02,741
It's not... your childhood dream.

1239
01:20:05,911 --> 01:20:08,330
You could be so much more.

1240
01:20:11,416 --> 01:20:14,544
People put you down enough,
you start to believe it.

1241
01:20:17,255 --> 01:20:20,634
I think you are very bright.

1242
01:20:20,759 --> 01:20:24,012
A very special woman.

1243
01:20:24,095 --> 01:20:28,099
The bad stuff is easier to believe.

1244
01:20:28,183 --> 01:20:30,810
You ever notice that?

1245
01:20:39,778 --> 01:20:42,948
I don't want to talk to him.
I'll call him Monday.

1246
01:20:43,031 --> 01:20:44,950
Did he sign this?
He had to leave.

1247
01:20:45,033 --> 01:20:47,410
You can't disappear now.
We're in too deep.

1248
01:20:47,494 --> 01:20:50,830
Don't panic. Morse isn't
going anywhere. I'll be back.

1249
01:20:50,914 --> 01:20:53,291
Did you send the tickets to the hotel?
Yes.

1250
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:55,377
Where are you going?
I have a date.

1251
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,295
With the hooker?

1252
01:21:01,258 --> 01:21:02,968
Be careful, Philip.

1253
01:21:24,406 --> 01:21:26,449
Do I look OK?
Mm.

1254
01:21:26,533 --> 01:21:29,619
"Mm"?
Something's missing.

1255
01:21:29,703 --> 01:21:33,123
Well, nothin' else is gonna fit
into this dress, I'll tell you.

1256
01:21:33,206 --> 01:21:35,417
Maybe something
in this box.

1257
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:38,461
I don't want you to get
too excited. It's only on loan.

1258
01:21:47,846 --> 01:21:50,348
They let you borrow this
from the jewellery store?

1259
01:21:50,432 --> 01:21:53,393
I'm a very good customer.

1260
01:21:53,518 --> 01:21:55,729
To buy this,
how much would it cost?

1261
01:21:55,854 --> 01:21:57,397
A quarter of a million.

1262
01:21:58,732 --> 01:22:00,734
A quarter of a million dollars?

1263
01:22:06,531 --> 01:22:08,450
So where are we going?

1264
01:22:08,533 --> 01:22:10,618
It's a surprise.

1265
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:15,248
If I forget
to tell you later,

1266
01:22:15,373 --> 01:22:18,209
I had a really good time tonight.

1267
01:22:18,293 --> 01:22:19,711
Thank you.

1268
01:22:39,397 --> 01:22:41,941
When you're not fidgeting,
you look beautiful.

1269
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:44,194
And very tall.

1270
01:22:44,277 --> 01:22:47,530

I've never been on a plane.

1278
01:23:10,929 --> 01:23:12,931
How'd you get to LA?
Bus.

<i>We should be there
in about 50 minutes.</i>

1286
01:23:45,797 --> 01:23:49,008
We're late.
No, it's all right.

1287
01:23:49,134 --> 01:23:51,719
Opening night never starts on time.
OK.

1288
01:23:53,304 --> 01:23:55,390
Program, sir.
Thank you.

1289
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:06,985
Right this way,
Mr Lewis.

1290
01:24:11,281 --> 01:24:13,908
Doris. Nice to see you.
How are you, Edward?

1291
01:24:13,992 --> 01:24:15,535
Sir.
Evening, Edward.

1292
01:24:15,618 --> 01:24:17,912
Congratulations.
Come here and look.

1293
01:24:17,996 --> 01:24:20,165
It's all right.
I've already seen it.

1294
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:23,585
If you're afraid,
why do you sit up here?

1295
01:24:23,668 --> 01:24:25,545
Because they're the best.

1296
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:28,298
Is there anything else, sir?
No, thank you.

1297
01:24:28,381 --> 01:24:30,675
The glasses are there.
Enjoy the opera.

1298
01:24:32,218 --> 01:24:35,388
So, you said this is in Italian.
Mm-hm.

1299
01:24:35,513 --> 01:24:38,516
How am I gonna know what they're saying?
These are broken.

1300
01:24:38,641 --> 01:24:41,060
Mine are broken.
That's OK. It's all right.

1301
01:24:43,646 --> 01:24:45,940
Oh.
You'll know. You'll understand.

1302
01:24:46,024 --> 01:24:47,525
The music's very powerful.

1303
01:24:50,361 --> 01:24:52,197
There's a band.

1304
01:24:55,033 --> 01:24:56,659
People's reaction to opera

1305
01:24:56,743 --> 01:24:58,953
the first time they see it
is dramatic.

1306
01:24:59,037 --> 01:25:01,498
They either love it
or they hate it.

1307
01:25:01,581 --> 01:25:05,126
If they love it, they will
always love it. If they don't...

1308
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:07,504
...they may learn
to appreciate it,

1309
01:25:07,587 --> 01:25:11,591
but it will never become
part of their soul.

1310
01:25:11,674 --> 01:25:14,010
Mm.

1311
01:26:55,695 --> 01:26:58,364
Bravo! Bravo!

1312
01:27:07,248 --> 01:27:09,500
Did you enjoy the opera, dear?

1313
01:27:09,584 --> 01:27:12,170
Oh, it was so good
I almost peed my pants.

1314
01:27:12,503 --> 01:27:13,588
What?

1315
01:27:14,922 --> 01:27:18,468
She said she liked it better
than <i>Pirates of Penzance.</i>

1316
01:27:18,551 --> 01:27:20,053
Oh.

1317
01:27:28,353 --> 01:27:30,188
I moved the queen.

1318
01:27:30,271 --> 01:27:32,607
You can't move the queen.

1319
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:34,776
Do you really
want to do that?

1320
01:27:36,778 --> 01:27:39,614
Why don't we finish this tomorrow?
I have to work.

1321
01:27:41,574 --> 01:27:44,535
Why don't you not go to work tomorrow?
Take the day off?

1322
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:47,789
Me not work?

1323
01:27:47,872 --> 01:27:49,540
Yeah.

1324
01:27:52,168 --> 01:27:54,462
I do own the company.

1325
01:28:05,932 --> 01:28:09,644
Here are the storage reports you wanted.
And Mr Lewis called.

1326
01:28:09,727 --> 01:28:11,062
What'd he say?

1327
01:28:11,187 --> 01:28:14,023
He said he's taking the day off.

1328
01:28:14,107 --> 01:28:16,567
He's taking the day off?
That's what he said.

1329
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:21,531
I'm starving.

1330
01:28:21,656 --> 01:28:24,158
There's a Snap Dog vendor.
Do you have any money?

1331
01:28:24,242 --> 01:28:26,577
I have money.
I don't know what a Snap Dog is.

1332
01:28:26,703 --> 01:28:28,538
I'm gonna...
You'll buy a Snap Dog.

1333
01:28:28,621 --> 01:28:30,998
We'll cop a squat
under a tree somewhere.

1334
01:28:31,082 --> 01:28:32,959
Cop a what?
Cop a squat.

1335
01:28:33,084 --> 01:28:35,586
Al right,
read the first two pages.

1336
01:28:35,712 --> 01:28:37,588
OK.

1337
01:28:43,136 --> 01:28:44,929
I was talking to someone.

1338
01:29:24,385 --> 01:29:26,304
He sleeps.

1339
01:31:56,579 --> 01:31:58,915
I love you.

1340
01:32:10,176 --> 01:32:12,845
What are you thinking about,
sitting by yourself?

1341
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:15,932
The fact that this will be
our last night together.

1342
01:32:16,015 --> 01:32:18,476
Then you'll finally
be rid of me.

1343
01:32:18,559 --> 01:32:21,854
Well, you've been
pretty tough to take.

1344
01:32:21,938 --> 01:32:24,941
My business is almost over,
so I'm going back to New York.

1345
01:32:29,654 --> 01:32:31,822
I'd really like
to see you again.

1346
01:32:32,490 --> 01:32:34,241
You would?
Yes.

1347
01:32:34,325 --> 01:32:37,495
Yes, I would. I've arranged
for you to have an apartment,

1348
01:32:37,578 --> 01:32:40,539
have a car,
have a wide variety of stores

1349
01:32:40,665 --> 01:32:43,501
that'll suck up to you
anytime you want to go shopping.

1350
01:32:43,584 --> 01:32:45,920
Everything's done.

1351
01:32:46,003 --> 01:32:47,838
What else?

1352
01:32:47,964 --> 01:32:51,008
You gonna leave some money
by the bed when you pass through?

1353
01:32:52,593 --> 01:32:54,387
It really wouldn't be like that.

1354
01:32:54,887 --> 01:32:56,931
How would it be?

1355
01:32:57,014 --> 01:32:59,350
For one thing,
it'd get you off the streets.

1356
01:33:00,101 --> 01:33:02,186
That's just geography.

1357
01:33:12,863 --> 01:33:15,408
Vivian, what is it you want?

1358
01:33:17,785 --> 01:33:21,914
What do you see happening between us?
I don't know.

1359
01:33:26,544 --> 01:33:29,296
When I was a little girl,

1360
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:31,966
my mama used to lock me
in the attic when I was bad,

1361
01:33:32,049 --> 01:33:33,843
which was pretty often.

1362
01:33:34,885 --> 01:33:37,054
And I would...

1363
01:33:37,179 --> 01:33:39,056
I would pretend
I was a princess,

1364
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:41,892
trapped in a tower
by a wicked queen.

1365
01:33:42,977 --> 01:33:46,480
And then, suddenly, this knight

1366
01:33:46,605 --> 01:33:49,233
on a white horse,
with these colours flying,

1367
01:33:49,358 --> 01:33:52,278
would come charging up
and draw his sword,

1368
01:33:52,361 --> 01:33:54,530
and I would wave.

1369
01:33:54,613 --> 01:33:57,241
And he would climb up the tower

1370
01:33:57,324 --> 01:33:59,076
and rescue me.

1371
01:34:02,371 --> 01:34:04,582
But never, in all the time...

1372
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:08,002
...that I had this dream

1373
01:34:08,085 --> 01:34:09,545
did the knight say to me,

1374
01:34:09,628 --> 01:34:12,339
"Come on, baby. I'll put you up
in a great condo."

1375
01:34:21,849 --> 01:34:23,559
Yes.
<i>I had to call.</i>

1376
01:34:23,642 --> 01:34:26,062
I just got off the phone
with Morse. Get this.

1377
01:34:26,145 --> 01:34:28,022
<i>He wants to meet
with you. Today.</i>

1378
01:34:28,147 --> 01:34:29,565
Why?
<i>He wouldn't say.</i>

1379
01:34:29,648 --> 01:34:31,734
Edward, his nuts
are on the block.

1380
01:34:31,817 --> 01:34:33,235
We got him.

1381
01:34:33,319 --> 01:34:35,196
<i>He's really caving in.</i>

1382
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:38,032
<i>I want him to commit his stocks
to us this afternoon.</i>

1383
01:34:38,115 --> 01:34:41,202
It's no good. If he's really caving in,
I don't want to wait.

1384
01:34:41,285 --> 01:34:43,996
Have Morse meet me downtown
this morning. Goodbye.

1385
01:34:52,129 --> 01:34:54,799
I have to go now.

1386
01:34:54,882 --> 01:34:56,801
I want you to understand.

1387
01:34:59,053 --> 01:35:00,930
I heard everything you said.

1388
01:35:02,348 --> 01:35:05,392
This is all
I'm capable of right now.

1389
01:35:05,476 --> 01:35:08,020
It's a very big step for me.

1390
01:35:09,313 --> 01:35:10,898
I know.

1391
01:35:10,981 --> 01:35:13,776
It's a really good offer
for a girl like me.

1392
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:18,656
I've never treated you
like a prostitute.

1393
01:35:24,995 --> 01:35:26,956
You just did.

1394
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:31,961
Barnard Thompson, Miss Vivian.

1395
01:35:32,044 --> 01:35:33,879
Could you come to
the front desk?

1396
01:35:33,963 --> 01:35:36,423
Someone here
wants to speak to you.

1397
01:35:36,549 --> 01:35:38,884
Her name is Miss De Luca.
Let me talk to her.

1398
01:35:39,009 --> 01:35:40,845
Let me just talk to her.

1399
01:35:42,555 --> 01:35:44,723
Yo, Viv, babe,
would you come down here?

1400
01:35:44,807 --> 01:35:47,101
The sphincter police
won't let me through.

1401
01:35:47,184 --> 01:35:50,437
OK. She's on her way.
Fine.

1402
01:35:50,521 --> 01:35:51,856
Mr Thompson.
Yes?

1403
01:35:51,939 --> 01:35:54,733
The window washer
is refusing to come down.

1404
01:35:54,859 --> 01:35:57,778
It's a Saturday.
Wait here, please. Watch her.

1405
01:35:57,862 --> 01:35:59,405
Yes, sir.

1406
01:36:10,958 --> 01:36:15,004
Fifty bucks, grandpa.
For 75, the wife can watch.

1407
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:21,844
I've been calling you.

1408
01:36:21,927 --> 01:36:24,096
Yeah, they told me
at the Banana.

1409
01:36:24,221 --> 01:36:27,474
You were supposed to come Tuesday.
I was hiding from Carlos.

1410
01:36:27,558 --> 01:36:30,102
If you picked up the money,
you wouldn't have to.

1411
01:36:30,186 --> 01:36:32,605
I was busy. I had a life.
Nino got beat up.

1412
01:36:32,688 --> 01:36:35,983
I had to visit him in the hospital.
Rachel got arrested.

1413
01:36:36,066 --> 01:36:38,736
Anyway, I got the money.
Thank you for saving my ass.

1414
01:36:38,861 --> 01:36:42,031
Now Carlos can get off it.
He was talking about you last night.

1415
01:36:42,114 --> 01:36:44,783
He would bust something
if he saw you in this outfit.

1416
01:36:44,867 --> 01:36:47,870
I was afraid to hug you.
I might wrinkle you.

1417
01:36:49,246 --> 01:36:52,416
You look really good.
No, something with shade.

1418
01:36:53,918 --> 01:36:56,337
You clean up real nice.

1419
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:59,882
Sure don't fit in on the boulevard,
not that you ever did.

1420
01:36:59,965 --> 01:37:01,342
Well, thanks.

1421
01:37:01,425 --> 01:37:03,469
It's easy to clean up
when you got money.

1422
01:37:03,552 --> 01:37:04,762
Yeah.

1423
01:37:06,555 --> 01:37:10,059
So, when does he leave?
Tomorrow.

1424
01:37:11,393 --> 01:37:13,812
You get to keep the clothes?
Yeah.

1425
01:37:14,939 --> 01:37:17,316
Edward asked me
if I wanted to see him again.

1426
01:37:19,276 --> 01:37:21,153
But I think, definitely no.

1427
01:37:21,278 --> 01:37:23,739
I mean, it's just
another week, right?

1428
01:37:23,822 --> 01:37:25,574
Definitely no?

1429
01:37:25,699 --> 01:37:27,117
Yeah.

1430
01:37:28,035 --> 01:37:29,411
Oh, no.

1431
01:37:29,495 --> 01:37:31,038
What?

1432
01:37:31,121 --> 01:37:34,041
I know this weepy look on your face.
Oh, no, don't.

1433
01:37:34,124 --> 01:37:37,127
You fell in love with him.
No. Kit, please stop it.

1434
01:37:37,211 --> 01:37:40,547
You've fallen in love with him?
Did you kiss him? On the mouth?

1435
01:37:40,631 --> 01:37:43,425
Uh, yeah, I did.
You kissed him on the mouth?

1436
01:37:43,509 --> 01:37:45,886
It was nice.
You fall in love and kiss him?

1437
01:37:46,011 --> 01:37:48,389
Did I not teach you?
I'm not stupid.

1438
01:37:48,514 --> 01:37:51,600
I'm... I'm not in love with him.

1439
01:37:51,725 --> 01:37:54,311
I just... I like him.

1440
01:37:55,145 --> 01:37:57,773
You like him?
Yeah.

1441
01:37:57,856 --> 01:37:59,650
You definitely like him?

1442
01:38:01,151 --> 01:38:03,696
Well, he's not a bum.
He's a rich, classy guy.

1443
01:38:03,821 --> 01:38:05,656
Who's gonna break
my heart, right?

1444
01:38:05,739 --> 01:38:07,866
Ohh, no. Come on.
You don't know that.

1445
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:11,370
Hey, he asked you, right?
Maybe you guys could like...

1446
01:38:11,453 --> 01:38:14,748
...you know, get a house
and buy some diamonds and a horse.

1447
01:38:14,832 --> 01:38:17,835
I don't know.
Anyway, it could work. It happens.

1448
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:21,714
When does it happen, Kit?

1449
01:38:21,839 --> 01:38:23,841
When? Who does it
really work out for?

1450
01:38:23,966 --> 01:38:26,176
Did it work out
for Skinny Marie or Rachel?

1451
01:38:26,302 --> 01:38:28,721
Those were very specific cases
of crackheads.

1452
01:38:28,846 --> 01:38:30,889
I just want to know
who it works out for.

1453
01:38:30,973 --> 01:38:32,891
Give me one example
of someone we know

1454
01:38:33,017 --> 01:38:35,311
that it happened for.
Name someone?

1455
01:38:35,394 --> 01:38:37,813
Like, give you a name?
Yeah, I'd like a name.

1456
01:38:37,896 --> 01:38:40,441
God, the pressure of a name.

1457
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:46,530
Cinda-fuckin'-rella.

1458
01:38:51,744 --> 01:38:54,538
Mr Morse, you said you wished
to speak to Mr Lewis.

1459
01:38:54,663 --> 01:38:56,957
Mr Lewis is now listening.

1460
01:38:57,041 --> 01:39:00,669
I've reconsidered my position

1461
01:39:00,753 --> 01:39:02,254
on your acquisition offer.

1462
01:39:02,379 --> 01:39:04,381
On one condition:

1463
01:39:04,506 --> 01:39:07,092
I'm not so concerned
about me, but...

1464
01:39:07,217 --> 01:39:09,511
...the people who work for me.

1465
01:39:09,595 --> 01:39:11,597
No problem.
They'll be taken care of.

1466
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,891
Now, if we could
address ourselves

1467
01:39:13,974 --> 01:39:16,769
to the contracts in front of you...
Excuse me, Phil.

1468
01:39:19,229 --> 01:39:22,107
Gentlemen, I'd like to speak
to Mr Morse alone.

1469
01:39:23,067 --> 01:39:25,069
Thank you.

1470
01:39:27,029 --> 01:39:29,490
You heard the man.
Please wait outside.

1471
01:39:31,450 --> 01:39:32,618
You too, Phil.

1472
01:39:35,204 --> 01:39:36,830
What do you mean?

1473
01:39:36,914 --> 01:39:39,416
I mean, I would like to speak
to Mr Morse alone.

1474
01:39:41,377 --> 01:39:44,963
Why does he get to stay?
Please.

1475
01:39:45,047 --> 01:39:46,924
Please.

1476
01:39:49,259 --> 01:39:51,512
I'll be right outside.

1477
01:39:51,595 --> 01:39:52,930
Good.

1478
01:40:09,446 --> 01:40:11,615
Is that better?
It's all right.

1479
01:40:11,698 --> 01:40:15,494
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Black.

1480
01:40:17,413 --> 01:40:20,874
Mr Morse,

1481
01:40:20,958 --> 01:40:23,627
my interests in your company
have changed.

1482
01:40:25,337 --> 01:40:28,382
What is it you're after now,
Mr Lewis?

1483
01:40:28,465 --> 01:40:32,553
Well, I no longer wish to buy
your company and take it apart.

1484
01:40:32,636 --> 01:40:34,596
I don't want
anyone else to either.

1485
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:37,808
And it is still
extremely vulnerable.

1486
01:40:38,892 --> 01:40:41,437
So I find myself

1487
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:44,481
in unfamiliar territory.

1488
01:40:44,565 --> 01:40:46,275
I want to help you.

1489
01:40:47,568 --> 01:40:49,153
Why?

1490
01:40:57,578 --> 01:41:00,497
Mr Morse, I think we can
do something very special

1491
01:41:00,581 --> 01:41:02,583
with your company.

1492
01:41:02,666 --> 01:41:04,334
What about our navy contracts?

1493
01:41:05,419 --> 01:41:07,254
Eh, they weren't dead.

1494
01:41:07,337 --> 01:41:09,423
Just delayed.
I bluffed a little bit.

1495
01:41:09,506 --> 01:41:12,718
You're very good at it.
Thank you very much. It's my job.

1496
01:41:15,179 --> 01:41:17,764
I think we can leave the details
up to the others.

1497
01:41:17,848 --> 01:41:21,685
I find this hard to say without
sounding condescending, but...

1498
01:41:21,768 --> 01:41:24,438
...I'm proud of you.

1499
01:41:27,566 --> 01:41:28,734
Thank you.

1500
01:41:30,944 --> 01:41:33,322
I think we can let in
the other suits now.

1501
01:41:36,617 --> 01:41:38,368
Let's continue the meeting.

1502
01:41:39,786 --> 01:41:41,997
Come in, gentlemen.
Sit down.

1503
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:44,458
Please, what was this all about?

1504
01:41:45,667 --> 01:41:48,378
It's all yours, Phil.
Finish it up.

1505
01:41:51,256 --> 01:41:53,634
Hold it.
These aren't signed.

1506
01:41:53,717 --> 01:41:57,554
These aren't signed. Can someone
tell me what the fuck is going on?

1507
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:01,141
Mr Lewis and I are
going to build ships together.

1508
01:42:01,225 --> 01:42:02,935
Great big ships.

1509
01:42:06,230 --> 01:42:09,358
I think I'm going to go for a walk.
Just stay here awhile.

1510
01:42:09,441 --> 01:42:11,610
Yes, sir, Mr Lewis.

1511
01:42:33,423 --> 01:42:36,218
Well, well.
Hello again.

1512
01:42:36,301 --> 01:42:38,262
I'm looking for Edward.

1513
01:42:38,345 --> 01:42:41,098
Edward's not here.
I thought he was with you.

1514
01:42:41,181 --> 01:42:42,766
No.

1515
01:42:42,891 --> 01:42:46,019
Edward is definitely
not "with me."

1516
01:42:47,896 --> 01:42:51,692
No. If Edward were with me...

1517
01:42:51,775 --> 01:42:53,777
When, actually...

1518
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:56,697
When Edward was with me,

1519
01:42:56,780 --> 01:43:00,742
he didn't blow off
billion-dollar deals.

1520
01:43:00,826 --> 01:43:04,955
I think that Edward's with you,
that's what I think.

1521
01:43:05,038 --> 01:43:07,332
Mind if I have a drink?
No.

1522
01:43:08,292 --> 01:43:10,043
No, thank you.

1523
01:43:11,461 --> 01:43:12,796
Well.

1524
01:43:12,921 --> 01:43:14,548
I'll just wait.

1525
01:43:14,631 --> 01:43:18,802
Uh, Edward will be back soon.
Any minute, he'll be home.

1526
01:43:21,346 --> 01:43:23,557
You know...

1527
01:43:24,433 --> 01:43:26,727
...this is not home.

1528
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:29,646
This is a hotel room.

1529
01:43:29,730 --> 01:43:32,524
And, uh, you are not...

1530
01:43:32,649 --> 01:43:36,069
...the little woman.

1531
01:43:36,194 --> 01:43:38,030
You're a hooker.

1532
01:43:39,156 --> 01:43:42,159
Maybe you're a very good hooker.

1533
01:43:42,284 --> 01:43:46,079
Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care
about losing millions of dollars.

1534
01:43:46,163 --> 01:43:49,333
Because I have to be very honest
with you right now, Vivian.

1535
01:43:49,416 --> 01:43:51,668
Right now, I really do care.
I really do.

1536
01:43:51,752 --> 01:43:55,672
And right now,
I am really pissed, you know?

1537
01:43:55,797 --> 01:43:58,425
Right now I am just
freaking out.

1538
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:02,596
So maybe if I screw you...

1539
01:44:02,679 --> 01:44:05,307
...and take you to the opera,
I can be a happy guy.

1540
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:06,892
Hey! Get off me!

1541
01:44:07,517 --> 01:44:10,395
Goddamn it! Ow!

1542
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:12,564
Ow!
Come on! Come on!

1543
01:44:12,689 --> 01:44:14,691
I'm gonna...
Get off me! Get off!

1544
01:44:14,775 --> 01:44:17,319
Is this 20 bucks? 30 bucks?
Get off me!

1545
01:44:17,402 --> 01:44:20,530
You a fifty-dollar whore?
What are you doing? Get off!

1546
01:44:21,531 --> 01:44:24,409
You want to hurt me?
You already did.

1547
01:44:25,369 --> 01:44:27,037
Get out of here!

1548
01:44:28,955 --> 01:44:31,416
She's a whore. She's a goddamn...
Shut up!

1549
01:44:33,877 --> 01:44:36,713
Oh, damn!
Shit. Goddamn it.

1550
01:44:38,548 --> 01:44:40,717
I think you broke my nose.
Get out.

1551
01:44:40,801 --> 01:44:44,137
What is wrong with you? Come on!
I've been there ten years!

1552
01:44:44,221 --> 01:44:46,306
I devoted my whole life to you!

1553
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:49,017
That's bullshit.
This is such bullshit.

1554
01:44:49,101 --> 01:44:51,395
It's the kill you love, not me.

1555
01:44:51,478 --> 01:44:54,856
I made you a very rich man
doing exactly what you loved.

1556
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:57,150
Now, get out of here!

1557
01:44:58,318 --> 01:45:00,404
Get out!

1558
01:45:09,663 --> 01:45:11,915
Why do guys
know how to hit a woman

1559
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:13,834
right across the cheek, wham,

1560
01:45:13,959 --> 01:45:16,503
and it feels like your eye
is going to explode?

1561
01:45:16,586 --> 01:45:20,173
What do they do? Do they pull you aside
in high school and show you how?

1562
01:45:20,257 --> 01:45:22,426
Is that... Ow!

1563
01:45:22,509 --> 01:45:24,344
Hey.

1564
01:45:25,971 --> 01:45:27,889
Not all guys hit.

1565
01:45:31,435 --> 01:45:33,937
I heard about what you did
with Morse.

1566
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:37,482
It was a business decision.

1567
01:45:37,607 --> 01:45:40,193
It was good.

1568
01:45:40,277 --> 01:45:41,778
It felt good.

1569
01:45:45,407 --> 01:45:48,243
I think this is OK.

1570
01:45:48,326 --> 01:45:50,412
I gotta get going.

1571
01:45:50,495 --> 01:45:53,290
Yes, I noticed you'd packed.

1572
01:45:53,373 --> 01:45:55,292
Why are you leaving now?

1573
01:45:57,627 --> 01:46:00,172
Edward, there'll always
be some guy,

1574
01:46:00,297 --> 01:46:03,800
even some friend of yours,
thinking he can treat me like Stuckey,

1575
01:46:03,884 --> 01:46:06,219
thinking that it's allowed.

1576
01:46:06,303 --> 01:46:08,263
What are you gonna do?

1577
01:46:08,346 --> 01:46:10,766
You gonna beat up everybody?

1578
01:46:11,516 --> 01:46:13,852
That's not why you're leaving.

1579
01:46:15,437 --> 01:46:19,316
Look, you made me
a really nice offer.

1580
01:46:19,441 --> 01:46:22,444
And a few months ago,
no problem.

1581
01:46:22,527 --> 01:46:24,321
But now everything
is different.

1582
01:46:24,446 --> 01:46:28,450
You changed that,
and you can't change it back.

1583
01:46:29,284 --> 01:46:31,161
I want more.

1584
01:46:32,829 --> 01:46:35,248
I know about wanting more.

1585
01:46:35,373 --> 01:46:37,667
I invented the concept.

1586
01:46:39,503 --> 01:46:41,963
The question is, how much more?

1587
01:46:43,298 --> 01:46:45,467
I want the fairy tale.

1588
01:46:47,344 --> 01:46:50,430
Impossible relationships.

1589
01:46:52,599 --> 01:46:56,645
My special gift
is impossible relationships.

1590
01:47:08,949 --> 01:47:10,826
Thank you.

1591
01:47:10,909 --> 01:47:13,119
You're welcome.

1592
01:47:14,704 --> 01:47:17,082
If you ever need anything...

1593
01:47:17,165 --> 01:47:20,168
...dental floss, whatever,
you give me a call.

1594
01:47:24,297 --> 01:47:26,466
I had a good time.

1595
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:28,343
Me too.

1596
01:47:38,937 --> 01:47:40,897
You want me
to get you a bellboy?

1597
01:47:40,981 --> 01:47:42,649
No, I got it.

1598
01:47:42,732 --> 01:47:44,317
I'll carry this.

1599
01:47:44,401 --> 01:47:45,819
Thanks.

1600
01:47:53,034 --> 01:47:54,369
Stay.

1601
01:47:54,452 --> 01:47:56,746
Stay the night with me.

1602
01:47:56,830 --> 01:47:59,916
Not because I'm paying you,
but because you want to.

1603
01:48:05,005 --> 01:48:06,798
I can't.

1604
01:48:14,014 --> 01:48:15,557
Goodbye.

1605
01:48:22,731 --> 01:48:25,817
I think you have
a lot of special gifts.

1606
01:48:39,664 --> 01:48:42,125
I didn't do it, sir.
No, I didn't say that.

1607
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:44,419
Call maintenance.
Have them deal with it.

1608
01:48:44,502 --> 01:48:46,296
Delegate authority.
Yes, sir.

1609
01:48:46,379 --> 01:48:48,131
Hi, Barney.

1610
01:48:49,132 --> 01:48:50,634
Miss Vivian.

1611
01:48:51,927 --> 01:48:53,386
Thank you.

1612
01:48:53,470 --> 01:48:55,472
I wanted to say goodbye.

1613
01:48:55,555 --> 01:48:58,433
Then you're not accompanying
Mr Lewis to New York?

1614
01:48:58,516 --> 01:49:01,978
Come on, Barney. You and me
live in the real world.

1615
01:49:02,062 --> 01:49:03,480
Most of the time.

1616
01:49:04,814 --> 01:49:07,901
Have you arranged transportation?
I'm gonna call a cab.

1617
01:49:07,984 --> 01:49:11,196
Allow me. Darryl.
Yes, sir.

1618
01:49:11,279 --> 01:49:14,282
Please take Miss Vivian
anywhere she wishes to go.

1619
01:49:14,366 --> 01:49:15,867
Yes, sir.

1620
01:49:22,832 --> 01:49:24,584
It's been a pleasure
knowing you.

1621
01:49:24,668 --> 01:49:27,420
Come and visit us
again sometime.

1622
01:49:29,005 --> 01:49:30,715
Stay cool.

1623
01:49:43,603 --> 01:49:46,439

Is that everything, sir?

1643
01:51:02,849 --> 01:51:05,477
Yes, everything.
I'll meet you downstairs.

1644
01:51:05,602 --> 01:51:08,229
Thank you.

1645
01:51:09,606 --> 01:51:12,400
We look so dopey.

1646
01:51:14,277 --> 01:51:16,780
San Francisco's not that great,
you know.

1647
01:51:16,905 --> 01:51:18,865
It's a bad climate.

1648
01:51:18,948 --> 01:51:20,867
It's foggy.
It's unpredictable.

1649
01:51:20,950 --> 01:51:23,161
I'll wear a sweater.

1650
01:51:23,244 --> 01:51:25,288
What are you
gonna do there?

1651
01:51:25,371 --> 01:51:27,707
Get a job.
Finish high school.

1652
01:51:27,791 --> 01:51:31,377
I got things I can do. I used to make
pretty good grades in high school.

1653
01:51:31,461 --> 01:51:33,505
I can see that about you.
I can see that.

1654
01:51:38,635 --> 01:51:40,887
Sure you won't
come with me?

1655
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:43,848
And leave all this?
Not in a million.

1656
01:51:45,433 --> 01:51:47,519
Come here.

1657
01:51:51,773 --> 01:51:54,442
Whoa. Whoa.
What is this?

1658
01:51:56,236 --> 01:51:59,280
It's part of the
Edward Lewis Scholarship Fund.

1659
01:51:59,364 --> 01:52:02,158
We think you got a lot
of potential, Kit De Luca.

1660
01:52:02,283 --> 01:52:03,993
You do?

1661
01:52:05,328 --> 01:52:06,913
You think I got potential?

1662
01:52:06,996 --> 01:52:08,623
Oh, yeah.

1663
01:52:08,957 --> 01:52:11,167
Don't let anybody
tell you different, OK?

1664
01:52:11,835 --> 01:52:13,253
OK.

1665
01:52:14,504 --> 01:52:15,755
Take care of you.

1666
01:52:16,172 --> 01:52:18,424
No, I can't. I can't.
It's your favourite.

1667
01:52:20,385 --> 01:52:22,178
What time's your bus?

1668
01:52:23,054 --> 01:52:24,681
An hour.

1669
01:52:25,390 --> 01:52:28,560
Yeah, well, I gotta split,
"cause goodbyes make me crazy.

1670
01:52:28,685 --> 01:52:31,396
Take care of you.
Whoa.

1671
01:52:36,818 --> 01:52:37,861
Mr Lewis.

1672
01:52:38,361 --> 01:52:40,655
You don't have any messages
for me, do you?

1673
01:52:41,281 --> 01:52:43,199
No, I'm afraid not, sir.

1674
01:52:45,743 --> 01:52:47,829
I'll need a car to the airport.

1675
01:52:47,912 --> 01:52:50,456
Darryl will take you
wherever you need to go.

1676
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:52,709
The limousine out front.
Yes, sir.

1677
01:52:52,792 --> 01:52:54,294
Thank you, Darryl.

1678
01:52:57,338 --> 01:53:01,134
One last thing. If you could return this
to Fred's for me, please?

1679
01:53:01,217 --> 01:53:04,387
Yes, of course.
May I, sir?

1680
01:53:05,471 --> 01:53:07,015
Of course. Please.

1681
01:53:14,063 --> 01:53:17,317
It must be difficult to let go
of something so beautiful.

1682
01:53:20,570 --> 01:53:24,073
You know, Darryl also drove
Miss Vivian home yesterday.

1683
01:53:28,703 --> 01:53:29,996
I'll take care of it.

1684
01:53:31,414 --> 01:53:33,583
Thank you, Mr Thompson.

1685
01:53:45,386 --> 01:53:48,264
Your plane
is leaving as scheduled, sir.

1686
01:53:48,389 --> 01:53:50,767
You should be back
in New York on time.

1687
01:54:01,861 --> 01:54:04,614
I'm gonna have to charge you
more rent than Vivian.

1688
01:54:04,739 --> 01:54:06,950
I got this beauty course
I'm looking into,

1689
01:54:07,075 --> 01:54:08,743
and I'm not gonna
be there much.

1690
01:54:08,826 --> 01:54:11,287
You know, you just can't
turn tricks forever.

1691
01:54:11,412 --> 01:54:13,665
You gotta have a goal.
Do you have a goal?

1692
01:54:13,790 --> 01:54:16,334
I always wanted
to be in Ice Capades.

1693
01:54:16,417 --> 01:54:18,044
Help you, love?

1694
01:54:18,127 --> 01:54:20,046
Here you go.
Thank you very much.

1695
01:54:20,129 --> 01:54:23,299
You got a lot of stuff?
Carlos burned most of my stuff

1696
01:54:23,424 --> 01:54:25,468
when I said
I was moving out.

1697
01:54:52,996 --> 01:54:54,289
Vivian!

1698
01:54:54,372 --> 01:54:56,541
Vivian!

1699
01:55:01,004 --> 01:55:04,340
Princess Vivian!
Come down!

1700
01:55:09,178 --> 01:55:11,764
It had to be the top floor, right?
It's the best.

1701
01:55:11,848 --> 01:55:14,642
All right. I'm coming up.

1702
01:55:49,177 --> 01:55:51,220
So, what happened after

1703
01:55:51,346 --> 01:55:54,307
he climbed up the tower
and rescued her?

1704
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:57,060
She rescues him right back.

1705
01:56:07,570 --> 01:56:09,405
Welcome to Hollywood.

1706
01:56:09,489 --> 01:56:11,032
What's your dream?

1707
01:56:11,115 --> 01:56:12,825
Everybody comes here.

1708
01:56:12,909 --> 01:56:15,828
This is Hollywood,
the land of dreams.

1709
01:56:15,912 --> 01:56:18,748
Some dreams come true,
some don't.

1710
01:56:18,831 --> 01:56:21,918
But keep on dreamin'.
This is Hollywood.

1711
01:56:22,001 --> 01:56:25,505
<i>Always time to dream,
so keep on dreamin'.</i>
