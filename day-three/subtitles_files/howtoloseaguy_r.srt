Well, I've been working on something
that's, kind of, different.

170
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,725
-It's... It's a political piece and it's...
-No.

171
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,644
Andie, you work
at <i>Composure</i> magazine.

172
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,522
We are fashion, trends, diets,
cosmetic surgeries,

173
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,192
salacious gossip, that's <i>Composure.</i>

174
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,861
-Okay, but...
-Look, Andie. Okay.

175
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,738
The column is new for you.

176
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,448
When you turn it into a must-read,

177
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,825
then you can write about
whatever you want.

178
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:20,370
Until then, you can write about
whatever I want.

179
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:22,414
-Understood?
-Yeah.

180
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,542
Michelle, what have you got?

181
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,255
I'm sorry, Lana.
I wasn't feeling very well.

182
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,676
-She got dumped.
-Oh, no, Michelle!

183
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,179
What a hellish ordeal for you.

184
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,973
But I must say,
you are looking fabulous.

185
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,684
Are we loving the way she looks, all?

186
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,062
-We love the way she looks.
-Oh, you're so right. She looks great.

187
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:49,983
-I haven't eaten since the split.
-Good for you! Write about it.

188
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,402
I can't use my personal life for a story.

189
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,571
I understand completely.

190
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,950
Who will use Michelle's personal life
for a story?

191
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,743
-Oh, I will!
-LANA: Go.

192
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,663
No, no, no! Lana, with all due respect,

193
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:06,834
Lori has no business mucking around
in my personal life, and I can't let her.

194
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,169
-I'II do it.
-What?

195
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,964
I'II sort of do it. It's...

196
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,882
You will be my inspiration.

197
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,677
-For?
-Look at Michelle.

198
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,722
-She is a great girl, right?
-LANA: Yes.

199
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,641
An amazing woman.

200
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,979
But she has a problem
hanging on to relationships,

201
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,273
and doesn't really know
what's she doing wrong,

202
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,941
which is like a lot of our readers.

203
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,109
Uh-huh.

204
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:37,573
So I was thinking that I could start
by dating a guy

205
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:38,949
and then drive him away,

206
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:43,662
but only using the classic mistakes
most women, like Michelle,

207
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,081
make all the time.

208
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,127
I'll keep a diary of it

209
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:55,966
and it will be sort of
a dating how-to in reverse.

210
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,012
-What not to do.
-Yeah.

211
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,682
<i>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.</i>

212
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,351
Yes. Go.

213
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,230
-Bart, what's new in the shoe...
-Wait, wait, Lana. I'm sorry.

214
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:11,481
Why 10 days?

215
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:14,651
Five days is too short,
and we go to press in 11. Yes?

216
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,238
BART: Okay, what we found out
is men are attracted to purple shoes.

217
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:21,450
-(MOUTHING) Thank you.
-BART: Now, I love them myself...

218
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,244
LANA: Maybe toss in something spiritual
as well.

219
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:27,122
Who's that chic Buddhist
Richard Gere cavorts with?

220
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,333
-The Dalai Lama?
-He's fabulous.

221
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,336
-Here's my 10:00. Welcome.
-Hi.

222
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:36,298
Ladies, Judy Spears and Judy Green
from Warren Advertising.

223
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,509
We're going to cook up
some fabulous tie-ins for the fall.

224
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:43,805
Jeannie Ashcroft, fashion and trends.
Michelle Rubin, fitness and health.

225
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,140
Excuse me. Hi.

226
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,392
And Andie Anderson,
our resident how-to girl.

227
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,604
Oh, I've seen your column, Andie.
What are you working on now?

228
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,149
<i>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.</i>

229
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,151
She's actually going to
start dating a guy

230
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,695
and then drive him away
in a week-and-a-half.

231
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,947
(BOTH LAUGH)

232
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,782
Sounds needlessly vicious.

233
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,617
It's going to be fabulous.

234
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,286
Now, all she has to do is run along
and find the lucky guy.

235
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,788
-Go, go, go.
-Nice to meet you.

236
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,790
Ladies, come.

237
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,376
Find the guy. Find the guy.

238
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,796
You are never going to pull this off.

239
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,967
Watch me. Tonight, I'II hook a guy.
Tomorrow, pull the switch.

240
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,176
Before the 10 days are up,

241
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,178
I'm gonna have this guy
running for his life.

242
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,515
You're not gonna burn his apartment
down or bite him or anything, are you?

243
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,517
No, I'm gonna limit myself

244
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,269
to doing everything girls do wrong
in relationships.

245
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,522
Basically,
everything we know guys hate.

246
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,149
I'll be clingy, needy.

247
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,776
-Be touchy-feely.
-ANDIE: Yeah.

248
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,361
Ooh! Call him in the middle of the night

249
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,405
and tell him everything
you had to eat that day.

250
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,407
What's wrong with that?

251
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,617
I'm kidding.

252
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,788
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

253
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,880
Hello, Ben.

254
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:02,175
-What are you doing here?
-Phil, I'm here for the meeting. Ladies.

255
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,178
-But, you weren't invited.
-Yeah, but I should have been.

256
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,431
I mean, it was my tip that DeLauer
was shopping for a new firm.

257
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:10,600
Yes, it was, but I have to think
in terms of who's best suited

258
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:11,893
within the company team.

259
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:14,646
Yes, sir, and that's me.
I wanna handle this pitch.

260
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,816
Ben, you sell Joe Blow
better than anyone else in my shop,

261
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:21,987
but these girls sell luxury
better than anyone else in the business.

262
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:25,115
We have to put our best foot forward
on this pitch.

263
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,826
-DeLauer would be our biggest account.
-Yes, sir, they would.

264
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:31,371
Annual advertising billings
of 50 to 60 million dollars,

265
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:34,249
and I am the man that's gonna
bring this home for you, Phil.

266
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,710
-MICHELLE: Why this place?
-Because it's perfect.

267
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,086
-Hi, Ingrid.
-Hi.

268
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:43,341
Mullen's is the après-work watering hole
for the upwardly mobile.

269
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,470
Now, to date, the diamond industry
has always targeted men,

270
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:50,182
sending the message that the woman
needs the man to buy her the rock.

271
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,517
All right, they say,
"A diamond is forever."

272
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,187
We say, "A diamond is for everyone."

273
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,563
-I like that.
-Yes.

274
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,816
We don't. "A diamond is for everyone"

275
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,944
sends the message
that diamonds are everywhere,

276
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,864
which means they're not rare,
and if they're not rare,

277
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,616
they lose their status.

278
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,494
Status is the reason to buy them
in the first place,

279
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,163
which Benjamin would know
if he understood women,

280
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,498
which you don't.

281
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,249
(ALL LAUGH)

282
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,920
You can't feel bad about that, Ben.
No man does.

283
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,838
-BARTENDER: Here you go.
-Thank you.

284
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,006
Oh!

285
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,257
Sorry.

286
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,595
-Here. Here.
-Thanks.

287
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,889
(HUMMING)

288
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,558
Hey, don't pressure her. She's perusing.

289
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,185
Yes, exactly.

290
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:41,358
Selling a diamond to a woman
is like making her fall in love.

291
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:46,905
She has to feel giddy, desirous,
adventurous and desperate.

292
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,157
Take a look around this room, Phillip.

293
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,910
Most of the women in this bar
are looking for just that.

294
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,496
Exactly. The skills required
to market diamonds

295
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,374
are the same as those needed
to make a woman fall in love, yes.

296
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,086
I'm not talking about lust.
A woman in lust wants chocolate.

297
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,047
A woman in love wants diamonds.

298
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,717
Yeah, I'm not talking
about lust either, ladies.

299
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:12,472
I'm talking about deep, meaningful,
head-over-heels, his-and-her towels,

300
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:16,351
let's grow old together L-O-V-E.

301
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,437
Look, I love women.

302
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:24,401
I do. Whether they're 4 or 40
or my 88-year-old grandmother,

303
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,278
I respect women, all right?

304
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,531
And I also listen to women.

305
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:34,661
And that's why I can sell myself
to any woman, anywhere, anytime.

306
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:39,416
Make a woman fall in love
with diamonds, Benjamin, or with you?

307
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,668
Either one.

308
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:45,130
-That's cocky, Ben.
-No, not cocky. Confident.

309
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,340
(CHUCKLES)

310
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,135
-I'd like to see you prove that.
-You would?

311
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,556
The agency is co-hosting a party
for the DeLauers at the Astor Museum.

312
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,391
The party's a week from Sunday.

313
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,561
Do you think you can make a woman
fall in love with you by then?

314
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,273
-Ten days.
-Any woman, anywhere, anytime.

315
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:07,027
Any single, available,
straight woman, yes.

316
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,198
Yes. I'm not trying to trick you, Ben.
In fact,

317
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:15,076
we'll choose a woman right here,
right now, in this bar,

318
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,661
and then you decide.

319
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,124
-So who's the lucky girl?
-Okay.

320
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,292
(CHUCKLES)

321
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,002
Let's see here.

322
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,755
There's that blonde babe
in the leopard print.

323
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,382
-She looks like fun.
-Be nice, ladies.

324
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:34,304
Or, wow, Miss <i>Babylon 5.</i>
Now she's on the prowl.

325
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,514
No.

326
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,099
Her.

327
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,310
-Her who?
-Her in the gray dress.

328
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,812
Blonde hair, pretty smile.

329
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,648
(LAUGHING)

330
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,235
Her?

331
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,534
-Done.
-What?

332
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,705
-Done.
-Done.

333
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,876
See the guy next to the horrible guy
in the green shirt

334

Listen to me. If you're gonna

something hyper-masculine, okay?

Something like Spike or Butch

866

but not Princess Sophia.

he freaked out.

1344

No. You did that behind my back.
She did it behind my back.

-I just wanted to say hi.
-Andie, you wanna talk to my mother?

You wanna talk to my mother?
Talk to my mother.

Hell, we can go to Staten Island,
spend the weekend with them, Andie.

1349

That's my dad
when he was an ensign in the Navy.

1357

you sprayed on my pillow?

-Oh, yeah.
-Well, that smell is gone now.
