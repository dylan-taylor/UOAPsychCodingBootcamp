SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 5TH

13
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,419
A primary school boy was on holiday
down in Izu with his family.

14
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:42,619
He wanted to go out and play,

15
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:46,379
but there was a TV show
he didn't want to miss.

16
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:49,259
So he recorded it on the VCR
in their room.

17
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:51,619
But the channels down there
are different from Tokyo's.

18
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:55,699
No station there uses that channel,
so it should've been blank.

19
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:59,620
But when he played it back at home,
there was a woman on the screen.

20
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,779
"You will die in one week," she said.

21
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,779
The kid stopped the tape,
and then the phone rang.

22
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,660
"You saw it."

23
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,539
And a week later, the kid died.

24
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,460
What's wrong, Tomoko?

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,940
- Who told you that?
- Everybody's talking about it.

26
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,660
- Did Yoko?
- No, not her.

27
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,061
What is it?

28
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:47,221
I saw a weird video the other day.

29
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,861
- Where?
- With Yoko and the rest.

30
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:56,461
Did all of you really go
and spend the night somewhere?

31
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:57,901
Nothing happened!

32
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:08,462
But that night...

33
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:14,182
...Iwata found this weird video,
and we all watched it.

34
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:19,542
How was it "weird"?

35
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:26,542
It's hard to say.

36
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:29,582
Just after it ended,
someone phoned us.

37
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:32,862
It was some kind of prank call.

38
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,142
How awful.

39
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:48,343
Everyone else had heard that story.

40
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:53,263
Today it'll be one week.

41
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:03,863
Come on!

42
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:07,343
You're just trying to scare me.

43
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,343
I had you going!

44
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,824
- I don't believe you!
- You're so easy to fool.

45
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:20,383
But did you really
spend the night there?

46
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:25,744
- So what happened?
- I'm not telling!

47
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:28,104
- Confess!
- It's a secret.

48
00:04:57,745 --> 00:04:59,225
Is it true?

49
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:11,265
Masami!

50
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:19,345
Masami!

51
00:05:34,346 --> 00:05:35,826
Hello?

52
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,667
She's right here.

53
00:05:44,746 --> 00:05:46,146
Hello?

54
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,507
Oh, Mum!

55
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:57,346
A friend came over.

56
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,666
Got it. Yeah, yeah.

57
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:09,547
Extra innings in baseball.
They'll be late.

58
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,827
Don't scare me like that.

59
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:20,427
Look who's talking.
I'm going to tell everyone tomorrow.

60
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:25,388
I'm going to the toilet.
Don't go upstairs without me.

61
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:26,788
Sure.

62
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,110
There's this "video curse"
everyone's talking about.

63
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,310
Yes.

64
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,150
Have you heard
what kind of video it is?

65
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,470
Yes.

66
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,950
- Don't look at the camera.
- Sorry.

67
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,310
Once more.

68
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,871
Have you heard
what kind of video it is?

69
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,871
I heard that suddenly
there's this scary woman

70
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:04,271
who says,
"You will die in one week."

71
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:06,790
They say if you watch late night TV,
she appears.

72
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,631
And then the phone rings.

73
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:13,511
Late night TV? What channel?

74
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:17,591
I heard it was on a local channel
down in Izu.

75
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:18,151
In Izu?

76
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:23,632
And is there really someone
who died a week later?

77
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,352
It's no one that we know.

78
00:08:31,152 --> 00:08:32,431
What is it?

79
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:35,432
A high school student I know told me,

80
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:39,792
a girl who'd seen it
died on a date with her boyfriend.

81
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:42,112
An accident?

82
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:44,512
They were found dead
in a parked car.

83
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:46,832
He'd seen the video, too.

84
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:50,312
It was in the newspaper
two or three days ago.

85
00:08:51,512 --> 00:08:53,272
Do you know what school?

86
00:08:53,393 --> 00:08:58,193
No. My friend heard it
from a friend of hers.

87
00:09:01,912 --> 00:09:04,792
- Ms Asakawa. Here you go.
- Thanks.

88
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:10,633
About ten years ago,

89
00:09:10,753 --> 00:09:14,353
a pop idol killed herself,
and people saw her ghost on TV.

90
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:17,193
Yeah, but everyone you ask
about this one

91
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:19,192
talks about the Izu Peninsula.

92
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:21,513
Well, maybe that's where
this one started.

93
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:24,313
Where's the woman from?

94
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:26,073
Further west, in Gifu.

95
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:29,793
That was after a big
traffic accident down there.

96
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,473
A big accident?

97
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:35,754
These stories get started
when people die horrible deaths.

98
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:38,594
- So what happened in Izu?
- I don't know.

99
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:40,593
Anyway, I'm off. Goodnight.

100
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,194
Goodnight.

101
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:05,714
YOUNG COUPLE
FOUND DEAD IN CAR

102
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:11,474
A 19-YEAR-OLD TOKYO BOY AND
A 17-YEAR-OLD YOKOHAMA GIRL

103
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:14,395
FOUND DEAD IN CAR
ON MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 6TH

104
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:24,715
Take care of it, will you?

105
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:29,155
Weren't you leaving early today?

106
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:31,195
Okazaki, will you do something for me?

107
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:33,755
Can you find this high school for me?

108
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,035
- Sure.
- Call me when you find it.

109
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:04,596
Yoichi!

110
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:09,437
You're changed already!

111
00:11:09,557 --> 00:11:11,556
I put your clothes out, too.

112
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,716
We need to hurry.

113
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:21,157
- Did Grandpa call?
- No.

114
00:11:24,757 --> 00:11:27,197
Why did Tomo-Chan die?

115
00:11:29,477 --> 00:11:32,517
Some strange disease, I guess.

116
00:11:33,477 --> 00:11:35,477
Zip me up.

117
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:42,957
Do kids die, too?

118
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:47,077
Sometimes they get sick.

119
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:53,518
But don't talk about that
at Aunt Yoshiki's. It's too hard for her.

120
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:58,438
Tomoko often played with you,
didn't she?

121
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,678
FUNERAL ATTENDEES -
THIS WAY

122
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,399
Dad...

123
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:27,679
- How's Big Sister?
- She's lying down. Best leave her alone.

124
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,359
I'll go and help.

125
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:35,759
Yoichi, you come and sit here.

126
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,200
Reiko-Chan.

127
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,160
Does anyone know why Tomoko died?

128
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,000
- No, not me.
- But the police did an autopsy!

129
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,080
But there was no evidence of a crime.

130
00:13:17,641 --> 00:13:19,360
People don't just die like that.

131
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:23,241
And it's a closed coffin.
Isn't that strange?

132
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:27,603
Yoichi?

133
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:31,883
You shouldn't just come in here.

134
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:41,603
Go downstairs.

135
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:51,084
Go on.

136
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:56,323
- Hello?
- It's Okazaki.

137
00:14:57,683 --> 00:14:59,804
I found the name of the high school.

138
00:15:01,604 --> 00:15:04,563
Seikei Academy in Yokohama.

139
00:15:06,444 --> 00:15:07,804
Thank you.

140
00:15:16,844 --> 00:15:19,924
IN LOVING MEMORY
SEIKEI ACADEMY

141
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:33,965
Excuse me.

142
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:38,605
Was the girl who died in the car
a friend of yours, too?

143
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:45,845
If there's anything you know...

144
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:49,485
They all died the same day.

145
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:53,285
Yoko and Tomoko.
And Iwata, too, on his motorbike.

146
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:55,246
They all saw the video.

147
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:57,085
What video?

148
00:15:57,205 --> 00:16:00,925
Yoko told us they'd all seen
this weird video.

149
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:03,886
When it was over,
they received a phone call.

150
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:07,886
Tomoko saw it, too? Where?

151
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:11,605
They all went and stayed over
somewhere.

152
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:15,686
The girl who was with Tomoko
when she died...

153
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:18,726
She went crazy and she's in the hospital.

154
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:22,046
She won't go anywhere
where there's a TV.

155
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:31,646
The girl was named Yoko Tsuji, 17,
in her third year at Seikei Academy.

156
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:35,766
The boy was Tadahiko Nomi, 19,
doing a college prep year.

157
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:39,367
The car doors were locked.

158
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,847
I've never seen a corpse
that looked like that.

159
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:07,287
Cause of death?

160
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:11,007
Unknown.
Their hearts simply stopped.

161
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:15,008
- Drugs?
- Nothing came up in the autopsy.

162
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,808
They'd just started snogging,
then they just died.

163
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:29,408
It doesn't make sense.

164
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,689
Yo-Chan was at the funeral.

165
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:10,809
He used to go upstairs
and play in her room.

166
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,250
Yes, he did.

167
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:15,052
THE PHOTO SHOP

168
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:27,692
I found Tomoko dead here.

169
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:32,852
Tomoko!

170
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:11,933
IZU PACIFIC LAND

171
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,253
Izu...

172
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:39,654
I might be late tonight.

173
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:42,374
Put your supper
in the microwave. Got it?

174
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:45,774
- Mum?
- Yeah?

175
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:48,814
Tomoko saw the cursed video.

176
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:53,975
Why did you say that?

177
00:20:54,694 --> 00:20:57,455
Don't say anything about that
at school, do you hear?

178
00:20:57,535 --> 00:20:58,934
I won't.

179
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:00,695
I'm off.

180
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:21,376
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 13TH

181
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,936
IZU PARKWAY

182
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:36,056
This is crazy!

183
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:46,736
IZU PACIFIC LAND

184
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,741
"My dad's fat. My mum's fat.
So I'm fat, too."

185
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:48,501
You're here alone?

186
00:24:48,582 --> 00:24:51,381
Yeah, I'm doing a bit of work.
Erm...

187
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:58,542
These four people stayed here
on August 29th.

188
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:02,022
Did you notice anything unusual?

189
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:06,183
Just a minute, OK?
August 29th...

190
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:31,023
That tape...

191
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:33,223
That one.

192
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:35,903
What tape is it?

193
00:25:35,983 --> 00:25:37,383
This one?

194
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:41,503
Someone must've left it.

195
00:26:44,226 --> 00:26:47,386
ERUPTION

196
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:05,026
SADA

197
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,828
One week...

198
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:02,030
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14TH

199
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:52,431
So Yoichi's in school?

200
00:29:54,271 --> 00:29:55,711
Year 1.

201
00:29:58,952 --> 00:30:00,872
So how are you, Ryuji?

202
00:30:01,911 --> 00:30:03,592
Same as always.

203
00:30:04,231 --> 00:30:05,792
What are you doing?

204
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,351
Teaching at a university.

205
00:30:14,352 --> 00:30:16,992
So you said there was a phone call?

206
00:30:17,112 --> 00:30:18,752
Yeah.

207
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:21,552
So this phone will ring after I see it?

208
00:30:21,632 --> 00:30:24,192
Four people died, all on the same day!

209
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:26,673
So go to a shrine and get an exorcism!

210
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:31,952
Take my picture.

211
00:30:39,313 --> 00:30:40,992
Face this way.

212
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:45,273
Hurry up and take it!

213
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:03,475
It's over.

214
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:22,516
No phone call.

215
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:27,356
Copy this for me.
I'll take a good look at it.

216
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:30,876
It's not certain death yet.

217
00:32:30,996 --> 00:32:33,397
It's a video. Someone must've made it.

218
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:38,357
I'll check who stayed there.
Also for pirate broadcasts.

219
00:32:42,437 --> 00:32:46,917
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15TH

220
00:33:04,437 --> 00:33:05,957
From the Izu bureau.

221
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:07,517
Thanks.

222
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:09,878
Why do you want
that list of customers?

223
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:13,637
Sorry, but I just need to check
something by myself.

224
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:06,199
Was it you?

225
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,399
Did you do this?

226
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,120
- Sorry I'm late.
- What's wrong?

227
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,401
Nothing.

228
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:04,881
How did it go?

229
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:07,521
No one I phoned
had taken a tape to the cabin.

230
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:11,321
And they all sounded normal,
not like they'd make a tape like this.

231
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:13,241
Pirate stations?

232
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,281
There's no record of an illegal broadcast
anywhere in Izu.

233
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:19,602
Here's the copy.

234
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:33,602
Asakawa...

235
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:47,323
Have you ever seen this woman?

236
00:35:54,843 --> 00:35:56,243
No.

237
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:18,204
This shot is weird.

238
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:31,403
From that angle, the cameraman
should appear in the mirror.

239
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,364
What do you mean?

240
00:36:36,204 --> 00:36:40,444
Well, you could fix it
with special effects, but...

241
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:47,965
"Eruption..."

242
00:36:49,284 --> 00:36:50,884
Which eruption?

243
00:36:56,725 --> 00:36:59,284
You can't read it on a regular home TV.

244
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,604
Come in.

245
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:19,366
This is Takano. A student of mine.

246
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:22,565
This is Asakawa, my ex-wife.

247
00:37:23,645 --> 00:37:25,526
How do you do? I'm Takano.

248
00:37:26,325 --> 00:37:27,765
I'm Asakawa.

249
00:37:31,765 --> 00:37:34,205
Sir, the publisher wants your essay.

250
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,646
Why did they tell you that?

251
00:37:36,726 --> 00:37:38,725
They couldn't get hold of you, sir.

252
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:41,566
Ask them to extend the deadline a week.

253
00:37:41,646 --> 00:37:44,526
Me? Ask them yourself, sir!

254
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:46,086
OK, OK...

255
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:43,968
It's no good.

256
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:54,288
"Sada."

257
00:38:58,208 --> 00:38:59,968
Is Yoichi all right alone?

258
00:39:01,168 --> 00:39:02,808
He's used to it.

259
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:08,848
Whoever did this
left a sign subconsciously.

260
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:11,409
He wants to be stopped.

261
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:24,329
Wait.

262
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,811
"Frolic in brine, goblins be thine."

263
00:40:36,891 --> 00:40:39,172
Sounds like some sort of saying.

264
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:44,331
- What does it mean?
- I'll check tomorrow.

265
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:02,692
...who says,
"You will die in one week'. '

266
00:41:02,812 --> 00:41:06,613
They say if you watch late night TV,
she appears.

267
00:41:06,692 --> 00:41:08,172
And then the phone rings.

268
00:41:08,253 --> 00:41:12,893
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 16TH

269
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,053
I heard it was on a local channel
down in Izu.

270
00:41:19,532 --> 00:41:20,813
Hello?

271
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:23,853
I found it.
As I thought, it is a saying.

272
00:41:23,932 --> 00:41:27,093
It's something
about "brine" and "goblins".

273
00:41:28,293 --> 00:41:30,213
A saying from where?

274
00:41:30,293 --> 00:41:33,173
Oshima Island.
There's a volcano, Mt Mihara, there.

275
00:41:58,694 --> 00:42:00,374
Hello, Yoichi?

276
00:42:01,294 --> 00:42:03,054
I'll be late tonight.

277
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:06,694
You're OK alone?

278
00:42:07,614 --> 00:42:09,094
I'm sorry.

279
00:42:25,815 --> 00:42:28,415
MOUNT MIHARA ERUPTS

280
00:42:36,135 --> 00:42:39,616
Here. But it's a long time ago.

281
00:42:44,735 --> 00:42:47,296
DID LOCAL WOMAN
PREDICT ERUPTION?

282
00:42:58,056 --> 00:43:01,256
- What is it?
- Do you have an Oshima Bureau?

283
00:43:01,336 --> 00:43:03,176
I think so. A correspondent.

284
00:43:03,256 --> 00:43:05,376
Get me the number. Tonight.

285
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:10,616
- What for?
- You only have four days left.

286
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:14,776
I'll handle it with your correspondent.

287
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,136
You stay with Yoichi.

288
00:43:41,977 --> 00:43:43,137
Grandpa!

289
00:43:43,217 --> 00:43:45,737
Well, hello.

290
00:43:45,817 --> 00:43:47,097
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 17TH

291
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:49,538
- He wants to go fishing with you.
- Is that so?

292
00:43:49,657 --> 00:43:53,817
- Come on, let's go!
- Let's go out fishing!

293
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:00,177
Grandpa! You've got one!

294
00:44:00,258 --> 00:44:03,417
Aww, he got away!

295
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:05,458
You're not very good at this!

296
00:44:07,498 --> 00:44:10,098
OK, let's try it again.

297
00:44:10,218 --> 00:44:12,538
Let's fish over here this time.

298
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:13,898
All right.

299
00:44:21,418 --> 00:44:23,458
You're home.

300
00:44:42,899 --> 00:44:44,139
Hello?

301
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:47,739
Your man in Oshima says

302
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:52,699
that our woman is probably
the one who predicted the eruption.

303
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,299
Her name was Shizuko Yamamura.

304
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,379
She threw herself
into the volcano 40 years ago.

305
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:05,740
- What do we do now?
- Go down there, I guess.

306
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:08,220
I'll go tomorrow.

307
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,420
Oshima? But I only have
three days left!

308
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,820
I know. And I have four.

309
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,020
I'll call you again.

310
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,981
Is something wrong?

311
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:40,461
No, just some work.

312
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:07,261
Auntie.

313
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:16,342
Yoichi?

314
00:46:58,223 --> 00:47:01,063
Yoichi! Did you bring that here?

315
00:47:01,783 --> 00:47:04,263
You did, didn't you? Why?

316
00:47:04,383 --> 00:47:05,863
Tomo-Chan...

317
00:47:08,903 --> 00:47:12,064
Tomo-Chan told me to.

318
00:47:31,984 --> 00:47:33,544
I was careless.

319
00:47:34,704 --> 00:47:37,384
I sensed something at your place.

320
00:47:38,464 --> 00:47:40,065
I thought it was the video.

321
00:47:40,745 --> 00:47:42,705
It was Tomo-Chan.

322
00:47:42,785 --> 00:47:44,824
She's not Tomoko anymore.

323
00:47:45,985 --> 00:47:48,305
Yoichi can see her, too, then.

324
00:47:59,465 --> 00:48:01,385
It's all my fault, isn't it?

325
00:48:03,025 --> 00:48:07,666
It should've ended
with Tomoko and the others.

326
00:48:09,146 --> 00:48:10,546
I wonder.

327
00:48:12,545 --> 00:48:14,906
Who did the story start with?

328
00:48:15,785 --> 00:48:18,026
Stories like that don't start with anyone.

329
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:21,506
People feel anxious,
and rumours start flying.

330
00:48:22,386 --> 00:48:23,546
Anxious?

331
00:48:23,626 --> 00:48:28,186
Or people start them,
hoping things will turn out like this.

332
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:53,626
Mr Hayatsu?

333
00:48:53,707 --> 00:48:56,827
Hello. Sorry you've had to come
all the way out here.

334
00:48:56,947 --> 00:48:58,307
This way.

335
00:48:59,587 --> 00:49:03,707
SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 18TH

336
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:13,587
The Yamamura family used to run
big fishing crews here.

337
00:49:13,987 --> 00:49:16,228
They're all but out of the business now.

338
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:20,428
Shizuko's cousin is still alive.

339
00:49:20,547 --> 00:49:22,587
His son and daughter-in-law run an inn.

340
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,988
I've booked you in there for the night.

341
00:49:39,348 --> 00:49:42,149
Why did Shizuko Yamamura
commit suicide?

342
00:49:42,228 --> 00:49:43,908
They say she went crazy.

343
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:47,148
The newspapers had written
some things about her.

344
00:49:54,548 --> 00:49:58,108
She was famous all over the island
after she predicted the eruption.

345
00:49:58,189 --> 00:50:00,989
It'd always been said
that she had strange powers.

346
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:03,269
She was what they call a seer.

347
00:50:03,989 --> 00:50:05,949
After that, a professor showed up.

348
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,629
You've heard of him, Heihachiro Ikuma.

349
00:50:10,629 --> 00:50:12,109
Wasn't he fired?

350
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:17,589
He brought Shizuko to Tokyo
and did experiments on her.

351
00:50:17,709 --> 00:50:20,150
He was trying to prove
the existence of ESP.

352
00:50:21,429 --> 00:50:25,269
The papers built him up,
then tore him down.

353
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:30,069
The media haven't changed much
in 40 years.

354
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,430
I remember hearing something about it.

355
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:38,550
But... didn't someone die
during one of the experiments?

356
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:45,990
Dr Ikuma disappeared
after his university fired him.

357
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:49,110
I doubt he's still alive.

358
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,231
Even if we found him, then what?

359
00:50:53,471 --> 00:50:55,231
They say Shizuko had a daughter.

360
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:12,991
Anyone in?

361
00:51:16,711 --> 00:51:18,871
- Hello.
- Welcome.

362
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,071
Right, I'll leave you to it.

363
00:51:23,991 --> 00:51:25,591
This way, please.

364
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:30,791
Will it be one room?

365
00:51:31,911 --> 00:51:33,512
Separate rooms.

366
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:39,991
This way.

367
00:51:44,032 --> 00:51:45,112
But...

368
00:52:02,593 --> 00:52:03,872
Please...

369
00:52:06,113 --> 00:52:07,873
Wait, please!

370
00:52:07,953 --> 00:52:10,313
Please tell me about Shizuko!

371
00:52:10,432 --> 00:52:14,233
- I have nothing to say.
- What about her daughter?

372
00:52:19,313 --> 00:52:21,233
There was no daughter.

373
00:52:51,354 --> 00:52:52,714
Not hungry?

374
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:56,234
No...

375
00:52:59,394 --> 00:53:03,234
When I die, be with me...

376
00:53:04,754 --> 00:53:06,635
Cut it out.

377
00:53:06,715 --> 00:53:07,914
Please!

378
00:53:09,075 --> 00:53:12,714
And then, if you learn anything,
use it to save Yoichi!

379
00:53:12,834 --> 00:53:14,275
Stop it, I said!

380
00:53:16,355 --> 00:53:18,595
The girl with Tomoko lost her mind.

381
00:53:19,515 --> 00:53:21,755
Who knows what'll happen to me?

382
00:53:21,835 --> 00:53:23,915
You'll be fine!

383
00:53:27,636 --> 00:53:29,556
Because I'm not "normal".

384
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:35,595
Maybe all three of us should just die!

385
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:39,875
Good idea. We shouldn't have
had a kid in the first place.

386
00:53:39,995 --> 00:53:41,316
Stop it!

387
00:53:48,396 --> 00:53:50,316
There are still two days left.

388
00:53:51,956 --> 00:53:54,876
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

389
00:53:57,676 --> 00:54:01,077
You were asking before about Shizuko...

390
00:54:04,917 --> 00:54:06,476
This is all that's left.

391
00:54:11,956 --> 00:54:13,517
Is this Dr Ikuma?

392
00:54:13,637 --> 00:54:17,317
Yes. It was before I came here.

393
00:54:18,197 --> 00:54:20,237
- Anyway...
- Thank you.

394
00:54:26,197 --> 00:54:30,077
Frolic in brine

395
00:54:31,197 --> 00:54:35,197
Goblins be thine

396
00:54:44,877 --> 00:54:49,318
SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 19TH

397
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:11,638
You'd best head home early.
There's a storm on its way tonight.

398
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:16,519
What was Shizuko like?

399
00:55:18,478 --> 00:55:20,199
She was a strange one.

400
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:24,159
She'd sit out here the whole day long.

401
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,879
Day in, day out,
just staring at the sea.

402
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,519
The fishermen all hated her.

403
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,399
For us, the sea is unlucky.

404
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:44,119
Every year, it swallows some of us.

405
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,479
And she'd just stare out at it...

406
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,840
"Frolic in brine, goblins be thine."

407
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,000
If you play in the sea,
the goblins will come for you.

408
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,280
Shizuko could read minds.

409
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,960
She would know things about people
that they didn't want known.

410
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,040
That could be painful.

411
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,160
Go home!

412
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,601
I have some similar abilities myself.

413
00:56:17,921 --> 00:56:20,841
You're the one who told people
about Shizuko, aren't you?

414
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,481
- It was you who called Dr Ikuma.
- I did what?

415
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,201
You thought you could
make money off Shizuko.

416
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,201
You took money
from the newspapers, too.

417
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:34,001
Shut up!

418
00:56:37,081 --> 00:56:39,801
Tell me about her daughter!
What happened to her?

419
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:42,681
- I don't know!
- She should've been with Shizuko!

420
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:48,321
You were there...

421
00:56:52,161 --> 00:56:55,122
...when Shizuko gave her demonstration.

422
00:57:28,843 --> 00:57:30,402
Correct.

423
00:57:36,883 --> 00:57:38,043
Correct.

424
00:57:39,803 --> 00:57:41,323
Correct.

425
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,443
Correct.

426
00:57:45,683 --> 00:57:46,883
Correct.

427
00:57:49,004 --> 00:57:50,843
This is a fraud!

428
00:57:50,963 --> 00:57:55,683
It's nothing but a vulgar magic show!
You don't fool me!

429
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:58,604
Dr Ikuma's deceiving you!

430
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:01,364
He's making a fool of you!

431
00:58:04,804 --> 00:58:06,124
Show us the...

432
00:58:13,725 --> 00:58:15,324
What's wrong?

433
00:58:18,684 --> 00:58:20,084
He's dead.

434
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:23,285
She's a monster!

435
00:58:29,004 --> 00:58:31,085
Sadako! You did that?

436
00:58:32,244 --> 00:58:33,484
Sadako?

437
00:58:34,925 --> 00:58:37,285
SADA

438
00:58:38,284 --> 00:58:40,085
Sadako killed him?

439
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:43,445
She could simply will someone to die?

440
00:58:43,525 --> 00:58:46,645
She was a monster.

441
00:58:49,246 --> 00:58:50,365
Sadako!

442
00:59:05,165 --> 00:59:06,446
Hey!

443
00:59:34,207 --> 00:59:39,887
Yes. When Shizuko killed herself,
Dr Ikuma took Sadako away with him.

444
00:59:40,006 --> 00:59:43,207
But no one knows where they went.

445
00:59:43,286 --> 00:59:45,607
Anyway, you have to find them.

446
00:59:46,407 --> 00:59:50,127
Dr Ikuma may be dead,
but Sadako would be in her 40s.

447
00:59:50,207 --> 00:59:52,207
I'll explain later. Hurry!

448
00:59:56,568 --> 00:59:58,488
I doubt Sadako is alive, either.

449
01:00:00,487 --> 01:00:04,167
She killed a man
just by willing him dead.

450
01:00:05,927 --> 01:00:08,648
That's power of a different order
from her mother.

451
01:00:10,727 --> 01:00:12,528
So that video...

452
01:00:14,168 --> 01:00:15,888
It's not of this world.

453
01:00:19,488 --> 01:00:22,528
It's Sadako's rage.

454
01:00:26,609 --> 01:00:28,728
She's put a curse on us.

455
01:00:37,648 --> 01:00:41,448
It's no good, the typhoon's too close.
All the ferries have been cancelled.

456
01:00:41,529 --> 01:00:43,529
Try a fishing boat. We'll pay.

457
01:00:43,648 --> 01:00:45,089
A fishing boat?

458
01:00:45,968 --> 01:00:49,249
The typhoon might change course.
Your best bet is to wait.

459
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:51,009
Then I'll find one!

460
01:00:51,769 --> 01:00:53,289
Mr Takayama!

461
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,370
- Hello?
- Ms Asakawa?

462
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:22,690
I'm sorry, but there's no trace
of either of them.

463
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:25,731
Hello?

464
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,290
Thank you.

465
01:01:37,771 --> 01:01:39,050
Yoichi!

466
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:57,571
Izu...

467
01:02:07,652 --> 01:02:09,091
Ryuji!

468
01:02:17,092 --> 01:02:18,372
Ryuji...

469
01:02:20,012 --> 01:02:22,292
The phone didn't ring at my house.

470
01:02:22,412 --> 01:02:25,012
The only place it rang
was at that cabin!

471
01:02:25,732 --> 01:02:27,172
So the doctor must've...

472
01:02:28,132 --> 01:02:29,812
But we're stuck here.

473
01:02:29,892 --> 01:02:33,572
You can't take a boat out
on a night like this!

474
01:02:38,092 --> 01:02:40,012
I'll take you.

475
01:02:50,092 --> 01:02:52,692
Sadako's calling you, isn't she?

476
01:02:54,133 --> 01:02:59,173
Maybe she wants me to drown.

477
01:03:10,293 --> 01:03:11,613
Take us.

478
01:03:28,814 --> 01:03:30,174
Strange, isn't it?

479
01:03:31,094 --> 01:03:33,094
I'm not afraid at all.

480
01:03:37,255 --> 01:03:41,694
Sadako probably died there,
before that cabin was built.

481
01:03:42,855 --> 01:03:45,974
Was Sadako Dr Ikuma's daughter?

482
01:03:47,294 --> 01:03:49,455
He was married with kids.

483
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:51,735
His relationship with Shizuko
caused a scandal.

484
01:03:51,855 --> 01:03:53,854
That all contributed to him being fired.

485
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,375
We have to find Sadako's body.

486
01:03:59,295 --> 01:04:02,535
Will that lift the curse?
Will that save Yoichi?

487
01:04:03,655 --> 01:04:05,575
It's all we can do.

488
01:04:10,455 --> 01:04:12,295
Just one day left.

489
01:04:38,336 --> 01:04:40,936
I guess Sadako doesn't hate you.

490
01:04:46,097 --> 01:04:48,937
Shizuko used to talk to the sea.

491
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:53,416
She'd just sit there and mumble to it.

492
01:04:55,537 --> 01:04:58,497
Once, I listened to her secretly.

493
01:05:01,457 --> 01:05:04,377
But it wasn't human language.

494
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:17,817
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 20TH

495
01:05:26,057 --> 01:05:27,257
Hello?

496
01:05:27,338 --> 01:05:28,897
Yoichi?

497
01:05:30,297 --> 01:05:32,818
I'll check back tomorrow.

498
01:05:32,897 --> 01:05:36,658
I'm bored here.
I want to get back to school!

499
01:05:38,497 --> 01:05:41,818
Don't say that,
you'll hurt Grandpa's feelings.

500
01:05:41,898 --> 01:05:44,659
Grandpa's laughing.
Want to talk to him?

501
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:52,739
I'm sorry.

502
01:05:54,698 --> 01:05:56,378
I'll hurry home.

503
01:05:58,978 --> 01:06:00,578
What's wrong?

504
01:06:02,938 --> 01:06:06,139
Mummy has something she needs to do.

505
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:11,659
Say hello to Grandpa for me,
won't you?

506
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:32,539
What time did you watch the video?

507
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:36,500
Seven or eight minutes past seven.

508
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,859
If the story's true, that's your deadline.

509
01:07:17,581 --> 01:07:19,181
Here it is.

510
01:08:35,944 --> 01:08:37,783
A well? I knew it.

511
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,104
A well?

512
01:09:24,865 --> 01:09:26,345
Her father?

513
01:09:29,745 --> 01:09:33,665
Dr Ikuma put this lid on.
Sadako's under here.

514
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:20,947
I'll go down.

515
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:02,628
Sadako was still alive!

516
01:11:03,908 --> 01:11:05,908
She tried to climb out.

517
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:30,469
Lower the buckets!

518
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:52,549
Take it up!

519
01:12:22,391 --> 01:12:23,591
Take it up!

520
01:12:45,711 --> 01:12:47,072
Take it up!

521
01:13:26,872 --> 01:13:28,512
It's six o'clock!

522
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:32,393
I know! Hurry and take it up!

523
01:13:55,713 --> 01:13:56,994
Take it up!

524
01:14:00,593 --> 01:14:01,954
Asakawa?

525
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:31,275
Damn it! Are you trying to kill me?

526
01:14:32,955 --> 01:14:34,155
Hey!

527
01:14:45,075 --> 01:14:46,355
Asakawa?

528
01:15:00,035 --> 01:15:01,316
Trade places.

529
01:15:02,635 --> 01:15:04,716
You can't lift anymore.

530
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:07,716
No!

531
01:15:09,195 --> 01:15:11,596
Then who's going to pull the buckets up?

532
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:14,236
Is this really going to do any good?

533
01:15:15,996 --> 01:15:17,756
And what about Yoichi?

534
01:15:18,596 --> 01:15:20,476
She'll go for him, too!

535
01:15:39,957 --> 01:15:41,797
Don't look down!

536
01:16:02,918 --> 01:16:04,877
Where are you?

537
01:16:04,997 --> 01:16:06,277
Come out!

538
01:16:36,118 --> 01:16:39,519
Please! Where are you?

539
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,120
It's you.

540
01:18:03,401 --> 01:18:05,721
Hey, Asakawa!

541
01:18:05,841 --> 01:18:08,641
It's past seven! It's 7:10!

542
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:11,481
We're saved!

543
01:18:30,002 --> 01:18:32,562
Why did the doctor kill Sadako?

544
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:36,002
His own daughter?

545
01:18:37,082 --> 01:18:39,683
Maybe she wasn't his daughter.

546
01:18:41,122 --> 01:18:42,283
Huh?

547
01:18:43,442 --> 01:18:48,043
Maybe her father... wasn't human.

548
01:18:55,082 --> 01:18:56,842
The marks are gone.

549
01:18:58,723 --> 01:19:00,163
It's over.

550
01:19:02,203 --> 01:19:04,123
I'll take you home.

551
01:19:52,844 --> 01:19:55,085
Get some rest.

552
01:19:55,164 --> 01:19:57,245
I've got a deadline to meet.

553
01:20:01,605 --> 01:20:02,885
Thank you.

554
01:21:03,527 --> 01:21:05,127
Idiot!

555
01:21:35,208 --> 01:21:39,568
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21ST

556
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:41,050
Why?

557
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:55,250
That's it... Asakawa!

558
01:24:35,294 --> 01:24:37,093
Are you a resident?

559
01:24:37,214 --> 01:24:38,813
I'm Ryuji Takayama's wife.

560
01:24:38,933 --> 01:24:41,734
The body's already been removed,
ma'am.

561
01:24:50,654 --> 01:24:51,933
What happened?

562
01:24:53,894 --> 01:24:56,974
When I got here,
he was lying on the floor.

563
01:24:57,054 --> 01:25:00,454
Did he say anything to you?
About a video?

564
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:06,454
His face...

565
01:25:19,935 --> 01:25:21,935
Why Ryuji?

566
01:25:23,174 --> 01:25:24,815
Will Yoichi die, too?

567
01:25:25,615 --> 01:25:27,735
Didn't we lift the curse?

568
01:25:28,775 --> 01:25:30,935
Why was I the only one saved?

569
01:26:28,377 --> 01:26:31,377
Sadako's curse was only lifted from me.

570
01:26:32,417 --> 01:26:34,697
Why not you, Ryuji?

571
01:26:36,897 --> 01:26:39,217
What did I do that you didn't?

572
01:26:41,017 --> 01:26:43,658
What did I do that you didn't?

573
01:27:00,218 --> 01:27:01,498
Ryuji?

574
01:27:21,219 --> 01:27:26,259
Something I did that you didn't
to lift the curse...

575
01:27:34,978 --> 01:27:36,579
I copied it!

576
01:27:37,379 --> 01:27:39,139
I showed it to you.

577
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:01,420
Dad? Yeah, I'm on my way.

578
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:04,500
I need a favour.

579
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,380
It's for Yoichi.

580
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:14,700
They say there's one way
you can see it and not die.

581
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:18,220
You have to copy it and show it
to someone else within one week.

582
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:23,060
- And what happens to them?
- They have to do the same thing.

583
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:26,740
- So it never ends?
- That's right. It goes on and on.

584
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:30,861
But if you don't want to die...
you'll do it, won't you?

585
01:28:43,421 --> 01:28:50,181
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22ND
