1
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:59,625
FOUR DAUGHTERS

2
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,334
In this film,

3
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:19,418
I will try to tell
the story of Olfa's daughters.

4
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:23,875
Olfa has four daughters.

5
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:30,583
The two youngest, Eya and Tayssir,
still live with her.

6
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:44,709
The two eldest,

7
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,542
Rahma and Ghofrane,

8
00:01:51,418 --> 00:01:52,875
were devoured by the wolf.

9
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:09,583
Where is Olfa?

10
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,251
Is she here?

11
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:12,834
She's on her way.

12
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,625
I'm so stressed!

13
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,418
It's like I'm shooting my first film.
I can't explain it.

14
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:31,500
Is she stressed
about meeting me too?

15
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:33,418
Did she say anything to you?

16
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:38,667
She wants to see the actors
who will play her two eldest girls.

17
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:41,625
More than me?

18
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:44,500
That's weird.

19
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,376
Very well.

20
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,418
So I'm worrying more than her.

21
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:02,750
As I understand it,

22
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:06,418
I am like the character of Rose,
in Titanic.

23
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,459
She tells her story,

24
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,376
and then actors interpret this story.

25
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:14,583
So I am Rose!

26
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:16,834
But in Four Daughters.

27
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:21,376
That's not exactly what will happen.

28
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,459
You, Eya and Tayssir
will act in the film.

29
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,834
But there will also be an actor,

30
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:30,500
who will play your character
when the scenes are too upsetting.

31
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,709
You will have to feel
everything that I felt,

32
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:02,251
that I went through
with my two eldest girls.

33
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:06,500
The suffering that I endured.
The pain of separation.

34
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:12,376
The anguish of waking up
with the memory of their disappearance.

35
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,750
And that could drive you crazy.

36
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:21,583
You know, as actors,
we learn how to keep a certain distance.

37
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:27,042
Becoming totally involved in a story,

38
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:30,209
immersing yourself
in an unknown reality,

39
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:35,542
can be very unsettling.

40
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,750
And it's true that it can hurt you,

41
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:40,084
so I have learned to protect myself.

42
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:42,167
And what if you can't?

43
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:45,750
If you can't get the character
out of your head?

44
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,126
If they unnerve you,
because they seem too real?

45
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:52,167
Kaouther isn't going
to invent anything in this story,

46
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,084
it is all true.

47
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,750
And that could disturb you.

48
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:57,418
Yes, I have to protect myself.

49
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,459
Eya and Tayssir,

50
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:04,376
you will also play yourselves.

51
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,042
I will introduce you

52
00:05:08,084 --> 00:05:11,292
to the two actors
who will play your older sisters,

53
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:12,625
Rahma and Ghofrane.

54
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,750
-Hello.
-Hello.

55
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:00,334
Hello.

56
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,334
I recognize Ghofrane.

57
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:11,334
She is Ghofrane.
And that's Rahma.

58
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,625
Is that right?

59
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,334
How did you guess?

60
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,500
Ghofrane... I will tell you.

61
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:21,500
Ghofrane has curly hair,
and she is slim too.

62
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:24,251
And also,
she exudes femininity, like you.

63
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:27,459
And you look like Rahma.
And me.

64
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:35,667
For me, as their mother,

65
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,459
nobody can replace Rahma and Ghofrane.

66
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,209
-You think we're going to replace them?
-Never!

67
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:44,750
-She looks like Ghofrane.
-She does. There's something.

68
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,625
She has the same smile.

69
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:50,251
The resemblance is striking
on that last photo of her.

70
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,667
I imagine that Kaouther had this photo.

71
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:54,792
She chose you well.

72
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,376
Above all,
it's a question of character.

73
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,418
Very feminine.

74
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:04,042
Ghofrane is calmer, right?

75
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:05,376
Rahma is sitting by me.

76
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:08,292
Ghofrane takes me in her arms,
Rahma doesn't.

77
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:11,334
Ghofrane sits next to me,
Rahma doesn't!

78
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:13,625
Come and sit next to your mother!

79
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:15,126
[speaking Arabic]

80
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,583
Gosh!

81
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:37,251
That is what will be painful
about this film.

82
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,750
We are going to relive it all.

83
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:45,418
It's going to reopen the wounds.

84
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:00,209
It's not...

85
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:03,542
I have never cried
over their disappearance.

86
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,542
I didn't even say
their names anymore.

87
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:12,251
I wasn't able to.

88
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:14,959
Just saying "Rahma" and "Ghofrane",

89
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:18,583
it reminds me of tragedy,
misery, extreme pain.

90
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,542
-All good?
-Hello.

91
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:28,209
Kaouther told me
that Olfa found it hard

92
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,292
to see "her daughters".

93
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:34,126
She broke down.
She couldn't even speak.

94
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:34,750
Hm.

95
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:38,042
So, I am going to take her place.

96
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:40,084
Here, yes.

97
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:42,459
-I am "Mom".
-Nice to meet you.

98
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:47,084
Who shall we start with?
Rahma or Ghofrane?

99
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,709
-This?
-No.

100
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:56,292
-That's Rahma. How old was she there?
-Fifteen.

101
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,000
Open it more.

102
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:01,126
That's fine. It's fastened.

103
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,126
-Help each other.
-A second.

104
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,209
-Did you often help your sisters?
-I used to wear one as well.

105
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:08,667
-You wore the hijab?
-Yes.

106
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:10,625
From what age did you wear it?

107
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,418
When I was eight or nine, maybe.

108
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,709
Oh.

109
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,334
For Ghofrane,
it really is a great job.

110
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,167
And Rahma, it's a fail?

111
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:27,917
With you, it's your personality.

112
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,459
It's your character that is similar.

113
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,084
You really remind me of them.

114
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:42,209
They tried on the hijab,
they liked it and they kept it.

115
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,709
[mumbling in Arabic]

116
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,334
Like I told you,

117
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:08,000
my mother was a single mother,

118
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,126
who was raising several daughters.

119
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,042
We were easy prey.

120
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:15,292
In a world without mercy.

121
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:19,209
My mother only had daughters.
Our father left us.

122
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:23,583
Often, men tried
to enter our home by force.

123
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,042
They tried to break down the door!

124
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,583
I was the only one
who was able to defend us.

125
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,292
"I was the only one
who was able to defend us."

126
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:36,334
"I was the only one
who was able to defend us."

127
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,084
I was young at the time.

128
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:41,418
I was just 13 or 14 years old.

129
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,583
But I was brave.

130
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:49,000
I was convinced that we had
to stand up for ourselves, you know?

131
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:50,167
"You know?"

132
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,209
"But I was brave.

133
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,459
I was convinced
that we had to stand up for ourselves."

134
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:58,500
I started to do weight training.

135
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:04,126
I did weight training,
I cut my hair like a boy,

136
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,209
I dressed like a guy...

137
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:11,126
I became a man,
to protect my mother.

138
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:16,334
I hit anyone who attacked us.
All of them.

139
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,459
I gave them all a beating!

140
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,459
"I hit anyone who attacked us.

141
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:23,959
I gave them all a beating!"

142
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:29,042
[layered speaking in Arabic]

143
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
[inaudible Arabic]

144
00:11:44,376 --> 00:11:46,542
I behaved like a guy.

145
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,251
I had turned into a guy.

146
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:53,084
Then a man came into my life,
and he broke me.

147
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,000
On my wedding night...

148
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:07,000
You know this kind of people.
You know what they expect.

149
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,209
Gently, Abderahmane,
I'm not going to take off.

150
00:12:26,251 --> 00:12:29,209
Go gently, please.

151
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll show you gently!

152
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,542
No, I didn't beg him.

153
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,167
I was firm, I gave him orders.

154
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,959
Now I remember, my sister came in.

155
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:41,209
May she be cursed!

156
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:43,500
She told him:
"Don't bother with the bed,

157
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:47,917
throw her on the floor
and block her in the corner."

158
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:51,500
And after that, she left the room.

159
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:54,084
Show me,
as if you were your sister.

160
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:55,042
Okay.

161
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:57,334
How's it going, Abderahmane?
Are you done?

162
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,959
This bitch,
she won't give herself to me.

163
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:04,042
What's the matter with you, Olfa?
What is your problem?

164
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:05,209
Go on, give yourself.

165
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,126
Or confess, if you have a problem.

166
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:09,251
People are waiting.

167
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:10,583
You want to cause a scene?

168
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,959
-Your sister really said that?
-Yes.

169
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:17,418
-And after?
-He pushed me onto the bed.

170
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:20,959
Action!

171
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,126
Get off me!

172
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:24,167
Shut your mouth!

173
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,500
-Stop that.
-Shut it.

174
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:29,917
I swear
that you're not going to touch me.

175
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,209
Get off me!

176
00:13:32,251 --> 00:13:34,875
He burped!

177
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:38,418
And the people who are waiting outside?
You want to bring shame on us?

178
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,084
You hear how he burps?

179
00:13:41,126 --> 00:13:44,292
So what?
It's not like you don't know him.

180
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:46,042
Don't be a pain. Hurry up!

181
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,334
He hasn't even looked at me.

182
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:50,459
You, listen to me.
My sister is a tough nut to crack.

183
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,000
See that corner?

184
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:54,209
Block her in there and do your business.

185
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,583
You have no shame.

186
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,418
People are waiting, hurry up.

187
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,500
-There'll be no scenes tonight.
-Get out.

188
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,500
-Are you not a virgin?
-I am!

189
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,000
-If you aren't, say so.
-I am, don't worry.

190
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:08,875
You're not here to have a good time.

191
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,500
Bravo!

192
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,542
Go on, leave us.

193
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,459
And you,
show her that you're a man.

194
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,209
All right, get out of here.

195
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,292
-And you, get up.
-I'm getting up.

196
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:19,792
-Get in the corner.
-Okay, I'm going.

197
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm going to the corner.

198
00:14:22,084 --> 00:14:25,625
If you want to do it in the corner,
we'll go there.

199
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,376
Go on, in the corner.

200
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,959
Get your hands off!

201
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,542
-You coward!
-Dirty whore!

202
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,376
-Dirty little...
-I'm going to show you!

203
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:36,542
You want to be a man?

204
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,167
-I'll teach you!
-Get off me, you bitch!

205
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:41,167
I'll teach you what being a man is!

206
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:46,126
There, are you happy?

207
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,292
Here it is!

208
00:14:52,126 --> 00:14:53,834
Go on, wipe yourself off!

209
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,000
You can come in.

210
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,084
I did this.

211
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:58,126
Look.

212
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,084
And she took out the sheet.

213
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,834
-A sheet stained with his blood?
-Yes, it was his blood.

214
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:14,084
Outside they began the party,
the ululations, the rifle shots...

215
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,209
They were rejoicing,
when he hadn't actually touched me.

216
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,042
After we wed,

217
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:30,542
my co-workers
would talk about their husbands.

218
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:34,126
They would talk about
what they got up to together.

219
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,209
I had nothing to tell
I was a little jealous.

220
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,875
We should concentrate for instance…

221
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:53,209
When we watched a movie
with romantic scenes,

222
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,042
I would say to him:
"Look, that's sweet."

223
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:59,875
And he would insult the actress.

224
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,084
She's a slut, that actress.

225
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:06,000
Hend Sabri, a slut?

226
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,583
-A total slut.
-Oh really?

227
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:10,500
I love you so much,
I want to bite you.

228
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:12,959
I would like to be a slut too.

229
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,042
Okay.

230
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,000
Go ahead.

231
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:17,334
I can't, by myself.

232
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:21,084
We have to do it together.

233
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,959
Did she say anything to you?

234
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:28,459
Sorry.

235
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:29,917
[muttering in Arabic]

236
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:35,500
It makes sense!

237
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,459
-Being slutty on my own?
-I know...

238
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,459
It's always the same.
It's never the men who are insulted.

239
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,292
Fix your moustache.

240
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:49,167
You, when you act out
this kind of sequence,

241
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:50,459
no one insults you.

242
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,126
Me, of course, I am a slut.

243
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:54,251
It's true!

244
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:56,959
In life like in the movies.

245
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,084
Exactly.

246
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:00,792
-Damn it!
-OK.

247
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,959
What do you think?

248
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:09,418
Sometimes, I told him:

249
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,459
"I'm going to teach you something.
Say: I love you."

250
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,167
Tell me: "I love you."

251
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'd like to hear you say it.
It's a beautiful word.

252
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:22,500
Making love, it's also about foreplay.

253
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,209
Things to do and say.

254
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,376
Come on!

255
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,542
But it went over his head. In the end,
I banned him from coming near me.

256
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,959
You just slept together once a year,
to have a child?

257
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,292
Yes, pretty much.

258
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:37,917
I was living a hard time.

259
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:42,500
Let me tell you
when we slept together.

260
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:46,042
When I didn't have any money at all.

261
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:51,875
If I saw that he had some money,
that he'd worked a bit,

262
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:55,418
then I would yield to him.

263
00:17:56,126 --> 00:18:00,167
I said to myself
that I had really earned that money.

264
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:06,042
That was maybe the only reason
that we slept together.

265
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,042
Ghofrane!

266
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,750
Mom, Dad's here.

267
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,376
Go back to sleep. Don't move.

268
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:51,292
Shh.

269
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:54,917
Ghofrane.

270
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:58,334
Ghofrane?

271
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:00,917
Are you asleep, Ghofrane?

272
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,583
You ignore me, like your mother?

273
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,084
Are you sleeping alone?

274
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:11,334
She hasn't let anyone in?

275
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,542
Stop, Dad. Are you not ashamed?

276
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,917
How did he pronounce it?

277
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,251
His accent?

278
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:20,459
He said to her:
"Your mother sleeps all dolled up..."

279
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,459
-"Sleeps" in which accent?
-"Sleeps".

280
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,917
-Shall I show him, Tayssir?
-Yes, go on.

281
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:26,792
He would say to her:

282
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,792
"You explain to me then,

283
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:33,500
this woman, asleep like that,
half naked,

284
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:37,084
with her whole body offered up,
who is that for?

285
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:40,583
It's not for me, in any case."

286
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,459
A father, for me,

287
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,042
is the man who...

288
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:49,542
who contributes to our birth,
through sexual intercourse.

289
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:52,334
Great, thanks very much.

290
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:56,625
He would have done better
finding something else to do,

291
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,583
instead of conceiving me.

292
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,625
He would insult Mom,
he would wake us up.

293
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,500
He would wake up Ghofrane to hit her.

294
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:08,500
-Why her especially?
-Because she was the eldest.

295
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:09,834
She protected us.

296
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,667
And also, she was very close to Mom.

297
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:15,500
-It was to hurt me?
-Exactly.

298
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:17,500
"Oh, that shitty night..."

299
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:18,834
That rotten night.

300
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,834
Mom was saying bad words.

301
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,625
Oh no, enough!
I've had enough of your swearing!

302
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,542
I'm an actor.
I can inspire the same feelings,

303
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,583
without swearing.

304
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,583
-No.
-What do you mean, no?

305
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,709
In Tunisia,
when we argue we cuss.

306
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:37,959
Especially at home.
This language is in our blood.

307
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,459
I'm talking to you about the film.

308
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,542
But it has to be realistic.

309
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:46,667
As a viewer, I would find it strange
that we tell the whole story

310
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:48,583
without a single swear word.

311
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:52,792
The only words that he said
and which left a mark on my childhood,

312
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,583
are cusses.

313
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:58,667
"You're all like your mother."
"A bunch of... I don't know what."

314
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:02,418
"If I catch you..."
"You will turn out bad."

315
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,709
That's what their father said to them.

316
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,625
You understand?
And I would say to them:

317
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:13,959
"You hear what your father is saying?

318
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:18,959
For him, there is no doubt
that you will end up as whores.

319
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:20,709
Don't let him be right!

320
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:24,376
Tell him that you are Olfa's daughters.

321
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,418
And that Olfa's daughters
are worthy of greatness."

322
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:31,959
-[muttered Arabic]
-Very well.

323
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:37,376
Look at this.

324
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,667
There it is!

325
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,583
The photo is really misleading.

326
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,583
-Ah, so you agree!
-Look at this wound.

327
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,583
-Yes, it lends to confusion.
-Thanks for confirming.

328
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:50,917
Magnificent!

329
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,418
Here's the butt crack.

330
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:56,583
I had gotten surgery on my leg.

331
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,750
I took a photo thinking I was using
an x-ray application.

332
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,667
I was young.
It was nothing more than a photo.

333
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,292
Later on,
my mother found it on the cell phone,

334
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:11,251
and she thought
that it was something else.

335
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:13,418
-She saw a butt crack!
-Exactly.

336
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:15,542
She asked who had taken the photo.

337
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,792
Rahma and Ghofrane said
that it was me and Eya

338
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:21,625
who were playing with the phone.

339
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,875
I said that I hadn't taken any photo.

340
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:31,750
But Eya, she doesn't know
how to stand up for herself,

341
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:33,917
so she always stays silent.

342
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:36,292
Everyone thought that it was her.

343
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,376
All my girls, except Eya,
could speak up for themselves.

344
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,917
They accused her,
and she didn't deny it.

345
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:44,500
I remember it as if it were yesterday.

346
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:48,542
I gave her two dinars,
I packed her a bag

347
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,709
and I put her outside in the rain.

348
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:54,251
-How old were you?
-I was young. Eight.

349
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:56,418
That is exactly how it happened.

350
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,834
I was crying:
"Mom, I swear, it wasn't me!"

351
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:02,500
She grabbed me by my sweater,
she pushed me,

352
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:06,209
and then she threw a red bag at me.

353
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:09,750
She flung it in my direction
and it hit me right in the head.

354
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:12,750
And then she threw
the two dinars at me.

355
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:15,667
I was begging her:
"I swear to you, it wasn't me."

356
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,500
You just had to say:

357
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:20,667
"It's nothing, Mom, it's just a leg."

358
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:24,459
-I'd forgotten.
-And when she showed you the photo?

359
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,418
When I saw the photo
I really thought it was "that" too.

360
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,667
-Had you forgotten as well?
-She hadn't.

361
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,376
No, I remembered.

362
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:39,418
But I was scared that she would hit me
for having taken a photo of a leg.

363
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,875
Even telling the truth scared me.

364
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:45,792
I will have to be the one
to act out this scene.

365
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:49,792
-I will hit both of them.
-Especially me.

366
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:54,792
And as an actor, my work lies
in understanding your motivation.

367
00:23:54,875 --> 00:24:00,542
To really understand
what made you snap.

368
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:04,834
For you, everything that relates

369
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:08,376
to the female body
is shameful and obscene.

370
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:12,834
We have to hide our bodies
and cover them up.

371
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:17,667
In my eyes,
my daughters had ventured

372
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,583
into dangerous territory.

373
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,834
What territory do you mean?
It's their body!

374
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:23,834
Let me finish.

375
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:28,418
For me, this photo,
it rang the alarm bells.

376
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:32,292
Their minds had become impure.

377
00:24:32,376 --> 00:24:35,834
Today, it's just a photo.
Tomorrow they will be stripping,

378
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:38,459
and then it will be sexual intercourse.

379
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:41,292
We were 8 years old
and you thought that.

380
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:43,251
Yes, that's what I was afraid of.

381
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:45,167
-And they were 8 years old?
-Yes.

382
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:48,542
When she accused us,
I was eight and she was six.

383
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:51,209
She was afraid that we would have sex.

384
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,709
"Intercourse!"
Honestly, the idea of it.

385
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:58,459
I asked myself these questions
for all four of my girls.

386
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:01,709
You are obsessed by sin

387
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:05,709
and God gave you four daughters,
to you, so full of fear!

388
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,334
Can you imagine the hell?

389
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:12,459
It's a tragedy. I hate girls.
I didn't want to have any daughters.

390
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:17,292
What I understand, is that for you,
their bodies are dangerous.

391
00:25:17,334 --> 00:25:19,418
There's no doubt about it.

392
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:22,292
The body, it's really
where the line is drawn.

393
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:25,167
It is the private property
of one single person.

394
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:26,418
-The husband.
-Yes.

395
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:29,583
But why do you think
that their bodies

396
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:33,709
are the property of a guy
that they haven't even met yet?

397
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:37,167
Even my husband
doesn't have the right to own my body.

398
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:40,418
Where does this attitude
of yours come from?

399
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,875
-Talking about your body like that...
-My body belongs to me alone.

400
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:48,334
Oh!

401
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:52,500
The warm up.
They're going to play soccer.

402
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,834
They are mutants!

403
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:06,459
-Come on, do the same.
-There's no way!

404
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:15,875
God deliver us!

405
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:25,209
Great!

406
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:47,126
-We were concentrating.
-And enjoying it.

407
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:49,750
Now, we're going to have a good laugh.

408
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:54,084
We let everything out,
so we can better concentrate afterwards.

409
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:56,292
[speaking Arabic]

410
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,459
Fine.

411
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:30,292
-What would you like to eat?
-Some nice spicy chicken.

412
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,376
Some nice spicy chicken?

413
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:35,418
-I will see to that. And you?
-Cannelloni.

414
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:38,251
-Cannelloni? That's so nice!

415
00:27:38,376 --> 00:27:40,292
-And you?
-Anything.

416
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:43,459
Come on, Ghofrane, play the game!

417
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,167
Mamma mia, it's so good!

418
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:53,292
Can you smell how spicy it is?

419
00:27:57,834 --> 00:28:03,750
They played this game
when we had nothing to eat.

420
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:06,167
Ghofrane was the most difficult.

421
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,084
She didn't say yes to anything,

422
00:28:08,126 --> 00:28:09,542
she didn't like anything.

423
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:12,792
Rahma, she loved everything.
A real peasant!

424
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:17,209
She did this role play
with empty dishes,

425
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:20,209
or with leftovers
that they didn't want.

426
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:22,750
They dreamed of tasty meals.

427
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:26,667
It kept them entertained
and they forgot.

428
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,126
I joined in with them.
We had a lot of fun.

429
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:34,334
It wasn't only
what they've just been playing.

430
00:28:34,418 --> 00:28:38,209
Actually, it was more spontaneous,
it ended in a good laugh.

431
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:40,583
We danced, we sang.

432
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:44,418
It's among our happiest memories.

433
00:28:45,084 --> 00:28:49,667
Girls, do you have
the same memories of that?

434
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:53,376
At that time, just playing this game

435
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:56,625
allowed us to feel like

436
00:28:56,667 --> 00:29:00,042
we had access to the things

437
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:02,334
that we were deprived of.

438
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:07,542
All these things
that we only saw on TV.

439
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,292
Rahma was always behind it.

440
00:29:09,376 --> 00:29:11,376
These festive moments were her doing.

441
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,292
Just like the dramas.

442
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,334
Her parties always turned into a drama.

443
00:29:16,376 --> 00:29:18,542
Like on Mom's birthday.

444
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,500
-What do you mean?
-She had prepared

445
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:23,209
little bits of paper to throw at her.

446
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:25,084
-Confetti?
-Yes.

447
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:31,084
She had put them in a candy box,
above the door.

448
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:35,209
Be easy on Rahma!

449
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:39,209
She beat her black and blue.
Poor thing, she had prepared everything.

450
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:41,167
Rahma doesn't fit her name:
"clemency"!

451
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:45,042
I nicknamed her "the curse",
instead of "clemency".

452
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:47,251
-That's so mean!
-You see?

453
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,418
-Want to hear what she's called me?
-Go on!

454
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:54,376
I'll make you a list, with a tune.

455
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,667
There once was a...

456
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,625
"You bastard!"

457
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:00,625
"I wish you were a ball
being kicked about by boys!"

458
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:03,334
"I dream of seeing your blood
spilled across the sidewalk!"

459
00:30:03,418 --> 00:30:06,251
"I want to watch the news
and find out you've died!"

460
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:09,583
"A tramp who wants
to go out with guys!"

461
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:14,667
"You go out and you make out!
You think I didn't know about it?"

462
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,209
Here comes a swear word.

463
00:30:16,251 --> 00:30:19,084
"You've still got shit on your ass
and you want to get guys?"

464
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:26,209
It hurt me, but I didn't show it.

465
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:27,459
I answered her like this.

466
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:32,084
But inside, I was enraged.

467
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:35,625
If I could have... I'm sorry,
but I wanted to strangle her.

468
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:41,000
I swear, these killer lines,
they cut me deep.

469
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:43,292
This film lets me speak out.

470
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:45,167
So you want to strangle me?

471
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:49,959
After the film, she'll make me feel bad.

472
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,292
-Of course!
-She'll bring it up again.

473
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:54,042
I haven't finished.

474
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:56,959
I want to strangle her and say:
"I'm not like that!"

475
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:58,583
Come on, try it!

476
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:01,959
That's all you've heard,
"strangle me"!

477
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,126
You haven't understood
how much it hurts her?

478
00:31:05,251 --> 00:31:07,042
You are selfish, Olfa.

479
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:10,042
It hurts her?
I understand, but that's how it is.

480
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:13,334
It's the legacy
of several generations, a heritage.

481
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:15,709
Period.

482
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,667
How long were they majorettes for?

483
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,709
About four years.

484
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:45,167
Or three...
Yes, it was a few years.

485
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:46,875
The weekends, vacations...

486
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,500
What age did they start?

487
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:53,167
They hadn't started high school.
It was in elementary school.

488
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:55,542
Eya and Tayssir hadn't...

489
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:59,625
They hadn't started school yet.

490
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:08,084
Everything changed after he fell.

491
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,209
-"God is one."
-Exactly.

492
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:11,709
"And Ben Ali is unequalled!"

493
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:17,209
I don't care about Ben Ali.
I was talking about his time.

494
00:32:17,251 --> 00:32:22,542
It's true that times were tough.
Of course, I'm speaking for me.

495
00:32:23,126 --> 00:32:25,500
But at least, we were all together.

496
00:32:26,126 --> 00:32:28,084
The revolution
didn't steal your daughters.

497
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:31,625
They were daughters of Ben Ali.
Good girls.

498
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:33,084
Ben Ali's daughters?

499
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:37,126
Yes, Ben Ali's children.
They were good girls.

500
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:39,583
Look what happened after he left!

501
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,209
The problem,
it's those who governed after him.

502
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:46,084
I know that. That's what I'm saying.

503
00:32:46,126 --> 00:32:47,917
-Hello.
-Here comes the teacher.

504
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,292
-Hi.
-You are stunning.

505
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:50,667
Thank you.

506
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:55,709
And here is the boss.

507
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,667
We're looking at videos
from 11 years ago. Eya was this high.

508
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,750
Yes, I remember.

509
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:04,625
I was about as tall as my jacket.

510
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:06,917
They were this high.
Her and Tayssir.

511
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:10,418
"The Singing of Man."

512
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:16,542
Thanks to security, humans rise up

513
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:22,625
Thanks to security, humans rise up

514
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,625
Security makes the children happy

515
00:33:25,709 --> 00:33:28,376
The young and not so young

516
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:30,959
Security makes the children happy

517
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,625
The young and not so young

518
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:36,292
The happiness of our mothers

519
00:33:36,376 --> 00:33:37,959
And our beloved homeland

520
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,042
And our beloved homeland

521
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:43,376
And our beloved homeland

522
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:45,000
In the name of God,

523
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,792
dear people of Tunisia,

524
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:50,625
I stand before you,

525
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,875
before all of you,

526
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:56,667
in Tunisia and abroad...

527
00:33:57,084 --> 00:33:58,334
Beat it!

528
00:33:58,376 --> 00:34:01,500
Liberty!

529
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:07,500
Freedom!

530
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:15,376
That day, I was cleaning
in this lady's house.

531
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,917
I was all alone,
and I was thinking as I cleaned.

532
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,459
When I take a decision,
I talk to myself.

533
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:32,542
"I don't want this anymore.

534
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:36,500
The people who are leading
this revolution are no better than me.

535
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:39,500
I can revolutionize my life as well."

536
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:41,875
I was waiting
until my children were older.

537
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,792
Why? For my daughters?

538
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,709
They will be better off without him.

539
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,583
They never see him in any case.

540
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,875
He doesn't give them affection
or money.

541
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:54,542
He never does anything with them.
He never takes them to school.

542
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:59,376
"He has stolen your youth,
why do you put up with him?

543
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:02,251
You can have a new life."

544
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,667
She asked, what brought me there.

545
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:07,459
And like that, we went to stay
with my sister.

546
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:10,959
She was surprised.
I said to her: "That's it.

547
00:35:11,418 --> 00:35:15,583
Tunisia has had its revolution.
Now I'm having mine."

548
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:20,292
I had only just arrived,
that same day,

549
00:35:20,376 --> 00:35:23,000
when my affair with Wissem began.

550
00:35:30,459 --> 00:35:32,251
Hi, Mohammed.

551
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:34,792
There's no Mohammed here.

552
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:37,625
Oh really?

553
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:41,251
Sorry, wrong number.

554
00:35:41,459 --> 00:35:46,000
At that time,
cell phones were a novelty.

555
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:50,750
With my daughters, we had fun
calling numbers at random.

556
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,500
You've got me in trouble with my wife.
Who are you?

557
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:03,792
Your wife?
Oh, this woman.

558
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:05,917
Put her on, I will apologize.

559
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,792
It's fine, there is no wife.

560
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,500
But who are you?

561
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:14,583
He totally cast a spell on me.

562
00:36:15,459 --> 00:36:21,709
He unlocked the woman,
the teenager inside me.

563
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:26,792
I became debauched,
rebellious, adolescent.

564
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,459
I did it all.

565
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,418
I did everything I wanted.
I wanted to love this man.

566
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:36,459
I wanted to experience
everything I hadn't experienced yet.

567
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:47,500
He had escaped from prison
during the revolution.

568
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:50,834
He needed a place where he could hide.

569
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,667
The police officers had no idea
that I existed.

570
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:57,583
Nobody could have suspected
that I was harboring a fugitive.

571
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:03,500
Do you know why he was in prison?

572
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:07,542
Yes, for a crime. He killed someone.

573
00:37:09,418 --> 00:37:13,376
He told me everything.
He didn't hide anything.

574
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:15,376
I knew everything.

575
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,292
It didn't scare you, this crime?

576
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:20,500
Not at all.
To me he was like an angel.

577
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:23,542
I didn't find any fault in him.

578
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:28,209
For me, he was the most handsome,
the most masculine,

579
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:31,292
nicest and most adorable man.

580
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:36,542
If he had killed someone in front of me,
I would have helped him hide the body.

581
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,126
Really.

582
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:43,209
Together,
we shared incredible experiences,

583
00:37:43,251 --> 00:37:46,334
that are unspeakable.
And for me, it was normal.

584
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:49,625
When he got out of prison,
a friend told him: "There's an old lady.

585
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:52,459
She's really old but a nympho.

586
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:58,209
Go see her, pleasure her,
and she'll give you your pocket money."

587
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,459
He went there,
and she gave him 50 dinars.

588
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:06,126
Some time later,
when we were flat broke,

589
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:07,459
he asked me what I thought.

590
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:09,750
"The old lady is our only solution."

591
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:12,542
I went with him to her place!

592
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:16,542
She had just died,
her casket was at the front door!

593
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:24,709
Action!

594
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:27,709
I kept my mouth shut about him,
for Mom.

595
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:32,376
I could have got my revenge on him,
so easily.

596
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:37,334
And he was a butcher
so there were lots of knives at home.

597
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,126
What did he take?

598
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:50,459
Everything.

599
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:53,167
What? Pills?

600
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,376
Yes, pills, all kinds of them.

601
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,583
He would become weird.

602
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:06,126
People take drugs
to enjoy themselves, right?

603
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:07,542
Not him.

604
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:10,625
He couldn't even control his body...

605
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:12,418
He couldn't even speak?

606
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:15,834
He was unable to speak,
he became like this...

607
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:19,459
All shaky, with a nasty look.

608
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:23,625
His actions turned nasty,
his words too.

609
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:29,834
The first year with Wissem,
it was good.

610
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,709
We were young.

611
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:32,334
Mm.

612
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:37,792
We weren't used to someone
being nice to us.

613
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,126
And he was nice.
Or that's how it seemed to us.

614
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:45,750
But then he didn't act the same
with all of us.

615
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:48,792
He was nice to one of us
and nasty to the other.

616
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:52,376
And all that in secret.

617
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:54,126
What do you mean, "in secret"?

618
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:58,126
For example,
he was kind and gentle with me.

619
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:02,542
And he was the one who bought food
for us. We didn't have much.

620
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:07,418
But he was our mother's boyfriend
and her daughters' boyfriend, let's say.

621
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:12,084
When he got bored of the mother,
he moved on to her girls.

622
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:15,334
The night with the mother
and the day with the daughters.

623
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,209
Are you at peace with yourself?

624
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:22,834
Do you have a clear conscience?

625
00:40:25,126 --> 00:40:27,209
I never loved you.

626
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:31,625
What I loved, was the happiness
in my mother's eyes.

627
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:34,625
Nothing else.

628
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:40,500
I thought that you would be the father
that I had never had.

629
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,209
But you made me hate the idea
of a father.

630
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:52,126
What have Rahma
and Ghofrane done to you?

631
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,292
What has Tayssir done to you?

632
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:05,542
"She's my daughter, my favorite."
That's what you said, you liar.

633
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:09,334
No father should do that.

634
00:41:13,418 --> 00:41:15,126
Why did you do that?

635
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:21,334
I hate you.

636
00:41:21,418 --> 00:41:23,667
I will never forgive you for it.

637
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,251
I hate you.

638
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:48,418
Can we cut?

639
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:13,167
What's up?

640
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:15,625
There's something that's bothering me.

641
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:17,459
Can you explain?

642
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,000
No.
It's not something for the cameras.

643
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:24,000
It will be a discussion
between you and me, outside.

644
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:28,583
Shall we cut, Kaouther?

645
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,418
Well, can we get to work?

646
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,459
Come on!

647
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,251
No, he doesn't want to.

648
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:39,042
Tell him that we need this scene.

649
00:42:39,126 --> 00:42:41,334
I need the audience to see it.

650
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:44,959
So that people know
who this man really is.

651
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,334
I want him to help me.
He should see it as supporting me.

652
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:54,084
I've already replayed this scene
with a shrink.

653
00:42:54,209 --> 00:42:55,209
I've gotten over it.

654
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:57,418
It's not new.
It's not the first time.

655
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:01,667
I've done this exercise in hospital,
surrounded by shrinks.

656
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:03,042
And much worse, even.

657
00:43:03,126 --> 00:43:06,376
-This is a film now.
-I know, I'm aware of that.

658
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,625
Film or not,
I've moved on from this.

659
00:43:11,084 --> 00:43:12,209
Don't let it bother you.

660
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:15,042
He shouldn't be scared.
I know what I'm doing.

661
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:20,334
It's just dialogue.
He's an actor, he knows that.

662
00:43:20,376 --> 00:43:22,292
He just has to think that I'm acting.

663
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:25,542
Tell him that it's lines of dialogue
that I've learned.

664
00:43:27,209 --> 00:43:31,167
I've already said all that.

665
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,418
Do you get it, Kaouther?

666
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:38,418
Don't be afraid of me!
Tell him that.

667
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:39,750
And you, Tayssir?

668
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,583
No, it's fine.

669
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:42,500
Hm?

670
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:44,542
All good. It's just that...

671
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,500
I haven't been able to...

672
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:52,251
I can't hate him.

673
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:55,084
Despite everything he did to me,
I just can't.

674
00:43:55,167 --> 00:44:00,917
Yes I am angry.
Yes I want him to pay for it.

675
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,251
But I'm not able to hate him.
It's weird.

676
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:08,334
Maybe because...
I don't hate my father either.

677
00:44:08,418 --> 00:44:12,500
And to me,
Wissem was more than a father.

678
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:16,917
When I was a little girl,
I thought of him as a father.

679
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:21,459
I could never have imagined
he would do such things.

680
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:25,709
And despite everything,
I am unable to hate him.

681
00:44:33,126 --> 00:44:36,583
He lied to my mother.
He made up stories to her.

682
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:40,334
That's what we want to prove
to her as well.

683
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:46,459
For a long time,
Mom said to us that Wissem

684
00:44:47,126 --> 00:44:49,126
was our victim.

685
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:53,834
She said that it was our fault
that she had lost him.

686
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:58,500
We're the ones who are lost
because of him.

687
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:01,167
We're the ones who are lost.

688
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:02,625
That's the truth.

689
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:16,042
My love is renewed

690
00:46:16,084 --> 00:46:20,042
My love, it multiplies

691
00:46:20,126 --> 00:46:24,334
My love is renewed

692
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:28,126
My love, it multiplies

693
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:31,959
I've loved you for so long

694
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:35,959
Since when you were a child

695
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:38,251
I've loved you with all my heart

696
00:46:38,334 --> 00:46:40,209
I've loved you with all my blood

697
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:42,459
I've loved you with all my heart

698
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:45,000
I've loved you with all my blood

699
00:46:45,084 --> 00:46:49,084
You were the flame
and I was the butterfly

700
00:46:49,126 --> 00:46:53,084
You were the earth and I was the farmer

701
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:57,167
You were the sea
and I was the drowned sailor

702
00:46:57,251 --> 00:47:00,834
I always come back to you...

703
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:04,000
Stop, I can't take it!

704
00:47:04,126 --> 00:47:06,126
You're there,
showing us your butterfly!

705
00:47:08,209 --> 00:47:10,126
And you dare to complain!

706
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,292
I hadn't realized
that they had grown up,

707
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:18,126
until when I divorced their father
and I went to live in Sousse.

708
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:22,000
You would have thought
they were different girls!

709
00:47:22,084 --> 00:47:24,959
They had changed.
They had grown up.

710
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:35,959
When I was little
and my breasts started growing...

711
00:47:37,126 --> 00:47:38,084
I was ashamed!

712
00:47:38,126 --> 00:47:40,376
Mine still haven't grown yet!

713
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:44,792
I didn't want to sleep on them.
I was scared they would sink in.

714
00:47:46,084 --> 00:47:48,875
That they'd go back in,
and it would leave holes.

715
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:55,917
Rahma and a cousin put two glasses
around my breasts.

716
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It stopped them growing more!

717
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:03,917
I was 11 years old.

718
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,500
My sisters made fun of me,
instead of being supportive.

719
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:11,500
-They made fun of me.
-Because of your periods?

720
00:48:11,542 --> 00:48:17,126
Yes, because I put the towel
the wrong way round, sticky side up!

721
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,000
And the cotton underneath.

722
00:48:19,834 --> 00:48:21,000
When I pulled it off...

723
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:27,500
-I can't even begin to tell you!
-That must have been so painful.

724
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:32,209
I didn't know! I pulled it off.
My pubic hair made this sound...

725
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:37,834
Eya, there's a man here!

726
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:41,251
So what? He's doing his job!

727
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,167
And anyway, he's filming you.

728
00:48:49,334 --> 00:48:52,292
Kaouther, I have to tell you
about when I discovered the...

729
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,875
Olfa, no! No hitting!

730
00:48:59,126 --> 00:49:00,500
Get off me!

731
00:49:00,709 --> 00:49:01,792
What's that?!

732
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:07,042
My poor butterfly.

733
00:49:12,292 --> 00:49:15,000
I am sexy, I've been told

734
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:16,959
Okay, Mom?

735
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:20,500
What a bunch of whores!

736
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:28,917
You little slut!

737
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:32,084
We didn't do anything!
Nothing at all, I swear to you!

738
00:49:32,459 --> 00:49:34,376
Get off him, Mom!

739
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:36,917
Just you wait, you. You'll see!

740
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:40,709
She had a private journal
and she wrote down everything in it.

741
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,084
Tayssir came to show it to me.
She was very close to Rahma.

742
00:49:44,376 --> 00:49:48,292
I read it and found out
that she was talking about a boy, Onssi.

743
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:54,959
"Your skin is a soft as a baby's,
your eyes as blue as the summer sky.

744
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,292
You were the first to kiss me.

745
00:49:58,334 --> 00:50:01,251
Your kiss awakened things
inside me..."

746
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:03,418
The word "kiss" sent me crazy!

747
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:08,000
-Where's the harm in all that?
-She said that a boy had kissed her!

748
00:50:08,084 --> 00:50:10,418
But come on, all girls do that!

749
00:50:10,459 --> 00:50:12,875
I don't care. I don't want that.

750
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:13,917
You never did that?

751
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:16,875
No. And even when I was married
the asshole didn't kiss me.

752
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,959
I wouldn't have gone and remarried
if he had kissed me.

753
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:26,542
Her high school told me:
"Rahma is skipping class.

754
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:28,917
We have sent you a notification."

755
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,834
What do you mean skipping class?

756
00:50:31,459 --> 00:50:33,500
That is when the supervisors
explained to me

757
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:35,917
that she had become a goth.

758
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,667
That she came in wearing black makeup,

759
00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:44,500
that she was hitting the other students.

760
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,500
That she was doing things,

761
00:50:47,542 --> 00:50:50,625
weird rituals,
things that were shocking.

762
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:52,667
I don't even want to say
what they were.

763
00:50:52,709 --> 00:50:55,667
But they said that she was
a worshiper of Satan.

764
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,042
A Satanist. I don't like that word.

765
00:51:18,376 --> 00:51:19,418
Sorry, Mom!

766
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,542
You have brought Satan into my house!

767
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:23,792
The devil!

768
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:27,334
-In my home!
-It is already full of devils.

769
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,500
In the name of God!

770
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:32,583
What's up with her, Mom?

771
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:34,709
In the name of God!

772
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:36,500
God protect us.

773
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:38,042
God protect us.

774
00:51:38,251 --> 00:51:40,376
"In the name of Allah"

775
00:51:40,418 --> 00:51:43,542
All praise is due to Allah,
Lord of the worlds -

776
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:45,459
The Entirely Merciful,
the Especially Merciful,

777
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:47,709
Sovereign of the Day of Recompense.

778
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:52,709
It is You we worship
and You we ask for help.

779
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:59,667
When Mom was working in Libya,
Ghofrane took advantage of it.

780
00:51:59,959 --> 00:52:02,750
She dated a guy with a motorcycle.

781
00:52:03,459 --> 00:52:07,959
But she couldn't get on the motorcycle
with long hairs like that.

782
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,709
So she went to have her legs waxed.

783
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,459
After that, she disowned us.

784
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:18,667
She said that she was an only child,
that her mother was working in Dubai,

785
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,500
that she had a mansion someplace,

786
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:24,834
with a swimming pool...
Basically, she had everything.

787
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:29,917
The neighbor who looked after us,
she had become Mom's snitch.

788
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,917
-The supervisor.
-The supervisor, yes.

789
00:52:32,376 --> 00:52:34,376
She said that she was the maid.

790
00:52:34,459 --> 00:52:35,459
The nerve!

791
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,292
One day, this lady called Mom.

792
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:43,583
"Come back,
your daughter is out of control."

793
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,625
She took the first bus.

794
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:48,292
We didn't think we were doing
any wrong.

795
00:52:48,376 --> 00:52:52,709
We thought that her hair looked nice.

796
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:55,418
We wanted ours to be the same.

797
00:52:55,459 --> 00:52:56,583
Girls, Mom's here.

798
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:58,459
Mom.

799
00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:05,583
Get out. You, stay.

800
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,292
You, stay here.

801
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:13,792
Ghofrane...

802
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,875
My daughter.

803
00:53:16,917 --> 00:53:18,000
Your hair...

804
00:53:21,709 --> 00:53:22,792
Is it new?

805
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:27,500
Hang on... You've waxed?

806
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:30,334
-You've waxed, Ghofrane?
-Sorry, Mom.

807
00:53:30,418 --> 00:53:32,376
-You've waxed?
-Sorry, Mom.

808
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,334
You've waxed your legs, Ghofrane?

809
00:53:34,418 --> 00:53:36,376
What else have you waxed?

810
00:53:36,459 --> 00:53:37,500
Answer me.

811
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:38,583
You've become a woman?

812
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:42,251
While I'm working in Libya,
you're slacking off?

813
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:47,334
What? Just show me, show me.

814
00:53:47,376 --> 00:53:49,667
You think that you're a woman now?

815
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,625
I'm sorry, Mom.

816
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:53,875
Show me.
Show me what you've waxed.

817
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:02,542
May God forgive me.

818
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:07,875
I didn't give her a chance,

819
00:54:07,917 --> 00:54:12,418
I didn't let her defend herself.

820
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,667
She'd had her hair cut into a bob.

821
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:18,292
I ripped out a clump of hair like that.

822
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:20,334
In my hand.

823
00:54:20,376 --> 00:54:22,625
I totally destroyed her.

824
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:25,709
When she hits you,
it's not just a couple of slaps.

825
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:29,459
She enjoys it.
She takes the gas hose,

826
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:31,376
she doubles it in half,

827
00:54:31,418 --> 00:54:33,376
and she hits and hits.

828
00:54:33,418 --> 00:54:36,875
We heard a whistling sound
from the force of the movement.

829
00:54:37,376 --> 00:54:41,709
She was crying, begging me.
The neighbor came to her defense.

830
00:54:42,418 --> 00:54:44,834
I hit him too and I threw him out.

831
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:47,292
After the pipe,
I took the broom handle.

832
00:54:47,376 --> 00:54:49,418
It ended up in pieces!

833
00:54:49,834 --> 00:54:53,376
When she stopped moving,

834
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,834
I thought that she was dead.
And I stopped.

835
00:55:09,251 --> 00:55:13,583
My sisters, I know that among you,

836
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:16,251
there are those
who don't wear the hijab

837
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:17,583
and don't pray.

838
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:23,418
Some want to repent
but they don't dare to come to us.

839
00:55:23,542 --> 00:55:27,209
We will deliver the hijab to your homes!

840
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:30,834
In our eyes,
you are the wonderful mother,

841
00:55:30,917 --> 00:55:33,167
the virtuous mother,

842
00:55:33,251 --> 00:55:34,292
the tender breast,

843
00:55:34,376 --> 00:55:37,459
the vast sea, self-sacrifice.

844
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:41,126
You are also the precious wife
whom we protect.

845
00:55:41,209 --> 00:55:42,209
[inaudible Arabic]

846
00:55:43,376 --> 00:55:49,292
It was an ordinary morning.
We heard that there was an event.

847
00:55:49,376 --> 00:55:52,792
We went to the square
where we found a tent with preachers.

848
00:55:52,834 --> 00:55:57,376
They said that they were going
to give out hijabs.

849
00:55:57,459 --> 00:56:01,126
The women of the neighborhood
wanted to take them

850
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:03,792
and sell them on to make some money.

851
00:56:04,418 --> 00:56:07,834
One of the girls in the neighborhood,
called Nessrine,

852
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:10,583
told Ghofrane to go and help herself.

853
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:12,792
So she went to take a hijab.

854
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:19,376
When she got to the square,
a sheikh put the hijab on her,

855
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:23,625
and began shouting: "She is the moon!",
because my sister is beautiful.

856
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:27,084
When she came back home,
we all made fun of her.

857
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:30,459
We told her to go and sell it
before it became used,

858
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,084
otherwise people
would refuse to buy it.

859
00:56:33,167 --> 00:56:35,334
But she didn't want to take it off.

860
00:56:41,126 --> 00:56:43,376
When Ghofrane began to wear the veil,

861
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:46,418
we really gave her a hard time.

862
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,500
What does that mean?

863
00:56:48,376 --> 00:56:52,292
Rahma called her a bat.

864
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:54,376
"Batman! You look ridiculous!"

865
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,625
Exactly.

866
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:59,376
"Look at you, your hair, your beauty...
You're wasting it.

867
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:01,667
Who will the boys
from the neighborhood date?"

868
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:05,459
Look at that, a walking black soap!

869
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:08,667
I'm stuck with looking
at that every day?

870
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:11,292
What's with her,
and you like this, Mom?

871
00:57:11,376 --> 00:57:12,209
Mom, talk to her.

872
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:14,376
Leave your sister alone.

873
00:57:14,418 --> 00:57:16,709
I'm ashamed! You like it?

874
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,251
Yes, I like it.
And you should do the same.

875
00:57:19,334 --> 00:57:24,042
Mom, respect is a mentality.
It's a way of behaving.

876
00:57:24,084 --> 00:57:28,334
We are people living here

877
00:57:28,418 --> 00:57:31,418
[layered Arabic]

878
00:57:33,418 --> 00:57:35,126
Look!

879
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:57,583
Are you okay?

880
00:58:04,418 --> 00:58:05,542
It's understandable.

881
00:58:06,251 --> 00:58:09,542
I can't even bring myself
to look at her.

882
00:58:16,251 --> 00:58:20,418
How old were you when Ghofrane
started wearing the niqab?

883
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:23,292
I was eight years old.

884
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:27,334
And when she left, I was eleven.

885
00:58:31,792 --> 00:58:34,750
And what were you like
when you were eight?

886
00:58:36,334 --> 00:58:38,292
I was horrible!

887
00:58:38,334 --> 00:58:39,583
In what way?

888
00:58:40,126 --> 00:58:41,334
I was really ugly!

889
00:58:42,709 --> 00:58:43,500
I was really ugly.

890
00:58:45,709 --> 00:58:46,792
I'm okay.

891
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:52,167
-We can carry on, Kaouther.
-Great, let's do it.

892
00:58:54,583 --> 00:58:57,667
It began to spread
throughout the neighborhood.

893
00:58:57,709 --> 00:59:00,209
There were a lot more veiled women.

894
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:05,084
Two weeks later,
Rahma went out grocery shopping.

895
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:10,334
She was wearing a T-shirt
with an image of the antichrist on it.

896
00:59:11,251 --> 00:59:14,126
She often wore that T-shirt.

897
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:18,334
That day, she came home
in a real state, in tears,

898
00:59:18,418 --> 00:59:21,583
and she asked Ghofrane
to buy her a hijab.

899
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:25,126
We insisted that she tell us
what had happened.

900
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:28,209
A certain Mr. Mustapha,
along with some other men,

901
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:33,418
had blocked her path
and spoken about the antichrist to her.

902
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:37,667
And they had mentioned
the punishments of the grave.

903
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:42,000
That's what had scared her the most,
the punishments of the grave.

904
00:59:42,251 --> 00:59:44,167
So she began to wear the hijab as well,

905
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:48,376
but she became much more radical
than Ghofrane.

906
00:59:51,542 --> 00:59:54,167
-Do you find me sexy?
-To die for!

907
00:59:54,209 --> 00:59:55,376
Drop dead sexy.

908
00:59:56,376 --> 00:59:57,625
Where are her eyes?

909
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:00,292
Bring that down a bit.

910
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:03,042
There they are!

911
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,542
-Lovely.
-Yes.

912
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:10,126
Yes. Fix it, here.

913
01:00:10,709 --> 01:00:12,376
Do you know what shocks me?

914
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,418
There wasn't any of that
before the revolution.

915
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,625
No niqab, no hijab.
Nothing.

916
01:00:17,709 --> 01:00:21,251
If someone wanted to wear the hijab
they would wear it at home.

917
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:23,542
If not, the police would take you away.

918
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:27,334
And they would hit you
with their batons.

919
01:00:27,418 --> 01:00:31,167
Under Ben Ali, before the revolution,

920
01:00:31,251 --> 01:00:35,000
you weren't even allowed
to wear a headscarf.

921
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:39,209
Those women who wore it
were arrested by the police.

922
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:44,376
They wanted to impose an ideal
of the Tunisian woman.

923
01:00:44,418 --> 01:00:46,126
How she should be,

924
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:49,126
what she is allowed to do or not.

925
01:00:49,209 --> 01:00:53,209
So much so, that back then,
wearing a headscarf

926
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:57,126
was an act of resistance,

927
01:00:57,167 --> 01:01:00,292
a way of opposing the established order.

928
01:01:00,376 --> 01:01:05,542
Because the hijab was banned
before the revolution,

929
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:09,542
it became a kind of symbol
of rebellion.

930
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:12,376
We are always drawn toward
the forbidden, actually.

931
01:01:12,459 --> 01:01:14,167
"What do you mean, no hijab?

932
01:01:14,251 --> 01:01:17,126
I'm going to rebel and wear it then."

933
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,875
And during the revolution,
my mother, my family,

934
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:23,292
and even me, as just a young girl,
we said:

935
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:27,042
"Ok, let's vote for those who love God
and wear the hijab again.

936
01:01:27,126 --> 01:01:32,126
They are closer to God.
They will better solve our problems."

937
01:01:32,459 --> 01:01:35,418
They want to mold women
as they want them to be.

938
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,542
Map out our lives for us,

939
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:41,126
and shape women
in the way that they see them.

940
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:42,376
No more, no less.

941
01:01:42,459 --> 01:01:46,084
Not let us do what we want to do.

942
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:49,418
Like dolls that they manipulate
as they please.

943
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,625
That they would dress as they like.

944
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:53,875
With no rights.

945
01:01:53,959 --> 01:01:58,000
For example, a girl like you
who has beautiful eyes,

946
01:01:58,084 --> 01:02:00,167
she wears it to one side
and it becomes alluring.

947
01:02:00,251 --> 01:02:01,542
Isn't that sinful?

948
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:05,583
Yes, but I'm speaking of those
who wear it for aesthetic reasons.

949
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:07,167
And so Rahma...

950
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:08,251
Go, go.

951
01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:10,251
She pulls that down too.

952
01:02:11,917 --> 01:02:12,583
Yes, like this.

953
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:15,583
-She pulls it down like that.
-Really? A blackboard.

954
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:18,875
So that you don't see
the outline of her shoulders.

955
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,459
A solid block. Nothing stands out.

956
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,418
You shouldn't be able
to make out any shape?

957
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,875
Nothing. Not a hand, nor a foot.
Nothing.

958
01:02:27,917 --> 01:02:31,126
And when you walk, you have to march.
Like that.

959
01:02:32,459 --> 01:02:34,251
Seriously?
I have to march too?

960
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:38,042
Like that, with your head down,
taking long strides.

961
01:02:38,126 --> 01:02:40,251
Whereas for Ghofrane,
you walk like this.

962
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,917
You don't even hear her footsteps.

963
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,917
And at the same time, my dear Ghofrane,
you have to do this with your eyes.

964
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:49,917
-Here.
-The beautiful eyes.

965
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,084
Show us those pretty eyes, Ghofrane.

966
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:55,042
But then, why wear the niqab?

967
01:02:55,084 --> 01:02:58,334
Why?
For appearance's sake. It's a look.

968
01:02:58,418 --> 01:03:01,167
It was the fashion, at that time.

969
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:05,875
Now, it's ripped jeans.
Back then, it was the niqab.

970
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:07,126
Fashion!

971
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:11,292
And once you are with the sisters,
time to pull the niqab up!

972
01:03:14,084 --> 01:03:16,167
We look at each other, as you do.

973
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:17,209
Everything's fine.

974
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,167
Go on, Ghofrane, lift yours up.

975
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:20,834
Go on.

976
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:22,875
I'd ask her to cover it.

977
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,834
My God!

978
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:27,251
Their reaction.
"My God! So beautiful!"

979
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:30,334
-Sister, you are so beautiful!
-God is great!

980
01:03:30,418 --> 01:03:35,042
So beautiful that in the end,
they pulled her niqab back down.

981
01:03:35,084 --> 01:03:36,251
Why?

982
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:43,209
The sisters were afraid
that their husbands would see her.

983
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:48,042
-And that they would want to marry her?
-They can have four wives.

984
01:03:48,126 --> 01:03:52,084
They do a whole ritual
for a girl who wears the niqab.

985
01:03:52,126 --> 01:03:54,542
-Especially if she is impious.
-In what sense?

986
01:03:55,126 --> 01:03:56,209
A whore.

987
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:58,000
No, I wouldn't go that far.

988
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:01,209
The way you saw me just now.

989
01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:03,251
A woman who doesn't pray,

990
01:04:03,292 --> 01:04:07,834
who doesn't follow
the religious commandments.

991
01:04:07,917 --> 01:04:09,875
We throw her a little party.

992
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:12,000
-How do you mean?
-Like a graduation ceremony.

993
01:04:12,418 --> 01:04:16,042
We dress her up
and we sing a song for her.

994
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:18,418
-Which one?
-I'll sing it for you.

995
01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:20,126
Sing along with me.

996
01:04:20,209 --> 01:04:21,792
This was a strange saying.

997
01:04:21,917 --> 01:04:27,834
Oh my sister,
don't let Satan corrupt you

998
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:33,834
The hijab is a divine command

999
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:38,000
Oh my sister,
their words were foolish

1000
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:44,000
They said that we were
as dark as the night

1001
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:51,000
They laughed at the hijab

1002
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:52,834
I adored Rahma.

1003
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:57,376
She was my role model.
I tried to copy everything she did.

1004
01:04:57,459 --> 01:05:04,000
I was very close to her
and I really admired her.

1005
01:05:04,376 --> 01:05:07,875
When she began to wear the hijab,
I wore it too.

1006
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:09,959
Eya didn't want to, at the start.

1007
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:14,376
When Eya turned up
and Rahma and I were eating lunch,

1008
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:18,126
we would push her away
and call her an infidel,

1009
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:20,042
and she would start to cry.

1010
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:24,000
It was the same
when she wanted to play with us.

1011
01:05:24,042 --> 01:05:29,418
We turned her away
because she wasn't wearing a hijab,

1012
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:33,042
and each time, she would cry.

1013
01:05:33,126 --> 01:05:36,042
We got our way in the end.

1014
01:05:36,126 --> 01:05:38,709
We defeated her.
She ended up wearing a hijab,

1015
01:05:38,792 --> 01:05:41,376
just to live with us.

1016
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:46,209
We really gave her a hard time.

1017
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:51,750
When she finally wore the hijab,
we became a family of veiled women.

1018
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:54,084
Like a small branch of Daesh at home.

1019
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:57,000
We salute the Islamic State,
our State

1020
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:59,459
Our State will triumph

1021
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:02,251
And by the mightiest

1022
01:06:02,334 --> 01:06:05,209
Sharia Law will triumph

1023
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,251
-What is this song?
-It's for sharia law.

1024
01:06:09,084 --> 01:06:11,834
We salute Baghdadi

1025
01:06:13,084 --> 01:06:15,042
The cops will turn up.

1026
01:06:15,084 --> 01:06:17,209
Olfa, where did you learn these songs?

1027
01:06:17,251 --> 01:06:19,959
-With the girls.
-You sang with them?

1028
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:22,000
Of course.
I did everything with them.

1029
01:06:22,251 --> 01:06:26,709
At the start, I was really happy
that they were wearing the hijab.

1030
01:06:26,792 --> 01:06:29,042
It didn't bother me at the beginning.

1031
01:06:29,126 --> 01:06:31,917
And then they grew ashamed of me.

1032
01:06:31,959 --> 01:06:33,917
Wearing pants
while they were all covered up.

1033
01:06:34,209 --> 01:06:36,000
Are you not ashamed?

1034
01:06:36,084 --> 01:06:37,959
Life comes to an end, you know.

1035
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,959
We will all end up above, up there.
What will you say in front of God?

1036
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,376
I'm not naked!
I wear a headscarf.

1037
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:49,167
The headscarf isn't enough.
God said to cover the face.

1038
01:06:49,251 --> 01:06:50,959
And how can I work, dressed like that?

1039
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:53,292
Are you working for your life
or for eternity?

1040
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:55,667
Do you want to burn in Hell?

1041
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,834
You don't even work!

1042
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:59,334
You spend your days going
from one mosque to another.

1043
01:06:59,418 --> 01:07:01,959
At least I'm helping people, Mom.

1044
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,875
Start by helping your sisters
and your mother.

1045
01:07:04,959 --> 01:07:07,792
No. My heart is purer than yours.

1046
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:11,167
-What do you know about my heart?
-I can see it in your face.

1047
01:07:11,209 --> 01:07:14,000
-Such a vicious tongue!
-Rahma has struck!

1048
01:07:14,418 --> 01:07:18,667
I am trying to warn you
so that God spares you

1049
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,000
at the final judgement.

1050
01:07:20,084 --> 01:07:23,000
So that you don't burn
and fry in Hell.

1051
01:07:23,084 --> 01:07:25,084
I know where I will end up.

1052
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:31,834
In the garden of Eden, up there,
with the houris.

1053
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:35,709
Okay, and if I wear this outfit,
who will feed you?

1054
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:37,209
Don't you worry about that.

1055
01:07:37,292 --> 01:07:40,376
-I can't work like that!
-You're finding excuses, Olfa.

1056
01:07:40,459 --> 01:07:43,875
It's your funeral.
We'll see what God has in store for you.

1057
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:46,709
You wear it if you want
but don't bug me about it.

1058
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:50,834
People will laugh at you.

1059
01:07:50,917 --> 01:07:56,000
They will say: "The girls wear it,
but look at their mother!"

1060
01:07:56,251 --> 01:07:58,126
They will call you a loose woman.

1061
01:07:58,209 --> 01:08:00,376
But will you listen to this bitch!

1062
01:08:01,376 --> 01:08:04,000
Imagine, you go out
and a car runs you over.

1063
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:06,000
It hits you and you die, right?

1064
01:08:06,042 --> 01:08:08,709
I'm not wishing that upon you,
but what will God do?

1065
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:10,042
You scare me.

1066
01:08:11,709 --> 01:08:13,126
Don't listen to her.

1067
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
What shall you
bring her to wear?

1068
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:16,917
You'll end up
in the lower depths of hell.

1069
01:08:17,376 --> 01:08:19,251
My girl, you really scare me.

1070
01:08:19,334 --> 01:08:22,209
-I will wear it.
-Help! She's really in character!

1071
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:24,625
Did you really answer her like that?

1072
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:26,959
-She's being serious there.
-Yes, totally.

1073
01:08:27,042 --> 01:08:29,334
She's a great actor.

1074
01:08:30,292 --> 01:08:33,709
You scared me.
I have goosebumps.

1075
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:38,875
That was how it happened, with Rahma.
She convinced me through fear.

1076
01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:42,251
And I wore it for a long time.

1077
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:45,084
They found the only way
to dominate you.

1078
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:48,625
With religion, with God.

1079
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:50,834
They reversed the balance of power.

1080
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:55,084
And also, it was you who started
with the prohibitions.

1081
01:08:55,126 --> 01:08:58,292
-So, they...
-Let me answer you.

1082
01:08:58,376 --> 01:09:04,126
That's right. I taught them to aim
and they shot me.

1083
01:09:04,209 --> 01:09:09,251
I taught them to be strong,
and they defeated me.

1084
01:09:09,334 --> 01:09:11,251
They were able to influence me.

1085
01:09:12,334 --> 01:09:14,000
This outfit, I don't like it.

1086
01:09:14,084 --> 01:09:16,792
I am only wearing it
to reenact this scene.

1087
01:09:16,834 --> 01:09:19,042
I don't even want to see myself
in the mirror.

1088
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:22,959
But when my daughter dresses like this,
it makes me proud.

1089
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:26,126
I don't like how Eya is dressed.

1090
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:30,000
I would be really happy
if Eya would wear it.

1091
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:34,084
You don't even want to look
at yourself in the mirror,

1092
01:09:34,126 --> 01:09:37,625
and you would like me to wear it
to make you happy?

1093
01:09:37,667 --> 01:09:39,959
I'm scared for you all.

1094
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,750
If they had wanted to go out
less covered up

1095
01:09:44,792 --> 01:09:48,084
or if they had stayed
in the goth craze,

1096
01:09:48,126 --> 01:09:52,625
as well as going out with guys,
would you have let them?

1097
01:09:52,709 --> 01:09:53,625
Never!

1098
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:56,875
So for them,
the only way to be free,

1099
01:09:57,292 --> 01:10:00,334
was to go down this path.

1100
01:10:16,959 --> 01:10:18,251
I love you.

1101
01:10:18,334 --> 01:10:20,875
You love me? Right?
You will get what you deserve.

1102
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:23,834
We are friends.
I am your beloved sister.

1103
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:25,292
Love doesn't come into this.

1104
01:10:25,334 --> 01:10:27,292
You've already hit me twice.

1105
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:30,000
Two times.

1106
01:10:30,084 --> 01:10:31,292
Show me your back.

1107
01:10:35,792 --> 01:10:37,042
Show me your back!

1108
01:10:37,959 --> 01:10:39,709
-Damn it!
-Are you playing with God?

1109
01:10:39,792 --> 01:10:42,542
What God?
God forgives, not you.

1110
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:43,792
Shut up, Tayssir.

1111
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:45,084
God is merciful, dammit.

1112
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:48,042
-4, 5, 6...
-Rahma, shit!

1113
01:10:48,084 --> 01:10:51,376
When we forgot or we were late to pray,

1114
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:54,959
Rahma would whip us.

1115
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:56,875
According to how major the sin was.

1116
01:10:56,917 --> 01:11:01,625
I've forgotten the rules
but it could go up to 50 lashes.

1117
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:04,542
She meant business.
The blows were hard.

1118
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:08,583
And when Rahma committed a sin,

1119
01:11:08,667 --> 01:11:11,750
she would self-flagellate like this.

1120
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:17,667
She'd throw stones at her till she dies.

1121
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:21,084
I remember,
one of Mom's friends got pregnant,

1122
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,709
but outside of marriage.

1123
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:28,750
Rahma decided to wait for her
to give birth and then apply sharia law.

1124
01:11:28,792 --> 01:11:31,834
The punishment? Stoning.

1125
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:34,583
How did you plan on doing that?

1126
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:36,875
The woman
would have fought back, right?

1127
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:40,084
We didn't do it.
It was Rahma's imaginary plan.

1128
01:11:40,126 --> 01:11:44,875
In a public place. She wanted
to tie her to a pole or a tree.

1129
01:11:44,917 --> 01:11:48,834
-So she was imagining the whole scene.
-Of course.

1130
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:52,959
She would tell her to her face:
"Once you give birth, you'll be stoned."

1131
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:56,667
She couldn't really do it.
She made it all up.

1132
01:11:56,750 --> 01:12:01,667
There are laws in this country.
She would have been put in prison.

1133
01:12:01,792 --> 01:12:06,959
It was above all to let us know
how bad it was.

1134
01:12:07,042 --> 01:12:09,959
If we had lived in a State
governed by sharia law,

1135
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:11,709
the woman would have been stoned.

1136
01:12:12,126 --> 01:12:15,251
If there weren't these laws,
it would be crazy.

1137
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:16,792
It would be the end.

1138
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:19,625
Rahma would order you about with slaps.

1139
01:12:19,709 --> 01:12:21,792
We wouldn't be shooting a film!

1140
01:12:23,042 --> 01:12:24,209
Thanks to God!

1141
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:34,792
-Eya is like my younger version.
-They look like each other.

1142
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,667
She looks like you in the photo.

1143
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:42,959
Yes, Eya reminds me of my youth.
She's my exact copy.

1144
01:12:45,959 --> 01:12:48,084
-Here.
-My mouth!

1145
01:12:49,251 --> 01:12:50,792
You got some on her.

1146
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:56,875
-I saw you Mom.
-What?

1147
01:12:57,251 --> 01:12:58,750
You slipped the headscarf off.

1148
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:04,792
-Did you see it? Her scarf was there...
-Shush, you!

1149
01:13:04,834 --> 01:13:09,792
-She's faking it.
-I swear, it slipped down by itself.

1150
01:13:09,834 --> 01:13:11,167
It's fine, leave it.

1151
01:13:11,209 --> 01:13:13,583
A photo without the headscarf, please.

1152
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:14,667
Leave it this way.

1153
01:13:14,834 --> 01:13:17,251
-Put it over your shoulders.
-Okay.

1154
01:13:17,834 --> 01:13:19,542
That's what you wanted!

1155
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:20,959
I look good like this!

1156
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,167
Listen to me.

1157
01:13:22,251 --> 01:13:25,709
You're wearing a mic.
The sound girls will go crazy.

1158
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:28,000
You can't touch it.

1159
01:13:28,042 --> 01:13:29,875
Leave the headscarf like that.

1160
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:33,084
Like a Chanel scarf.

1161
01:13:36,251 --> 01:13:38,251
Let's say I'm your real mother.

1162
01:13:39,709 --> 01:13:41,667
Would you accept me as your mother?

1163
01:13:42,959 --> 01:13:46,500
-As Ghofrane, you mean?
-No, your real mother, yours.

1164
01:13:46,542 --> 01:13:49,667
She would be obliged to.

1165
01:13:49,709 --> 01:13:53,959
Would you be satisfied with me
as your mother, with the way that I am?

1166
01:13:55,667 --> 01:13:57,500
Did you choose your mother?

1167
01:13:57,709 --> 01:14:01,709
Have any of us chosen their mother?
If you had the choice...

1168
01:14:01,792 --> 01:14:06,709
We don't choose, but would you choose
the same mother and father?

1169
01:14:06,792 --> 01:14:08,084
No.

1170
01:14:08,126 --> 01:14:09,500
There you go.

1171
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:30,500
With Rahma,

1172
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,459
we would often watch videos together.

1173
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:38,084
One day, she came across a video
on YouTube.

1174
01:14:38,126 --> 01:14:44,542
It was a man who wanted
to spend a whole night buried alive.

1175
01:14:44,583 --> 01:14:47,000
He was buried with an oxygen tank.

1176
01:14:47,126 --> 01:14:50,084
He wanted to spend the whole night
inside the grave.

1177
01:14:50,126 --> 01:14:53,084
When he came out the next day,
he was in tears.

1178
01:14:53,126 --> 01:14:54,750
He was afraid of God.

1179
01:14:54,792 --> 01:14:56,959
He was crying,
and Rahma was crying harder.

1180
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,042
And I was like:
"Hang on, I am supposed to cry at that?"

1181
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:05,542
She wanted to try it.
To go inside a grave.

1182
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:08,376
She loved the idea, she researched it.

1183
01:15:08,459 --> 01:15:13,376
She became obsessed with it.
She wanted to try even if it meant dying.

1184
01:15:13,459 --> 01:15:16,042
Some people dream
of going to the Maldives.

1185
01:15:16,126 --> 01:15:20,709
My sister, she dreamed
of spending a night in a grave.

1186
01:15:39,459 --> 01:15:42,292
Boom, boom, boom.
The truth will be revealed.

1187
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:45,334
She is in the madhouse,
and God forgives everything.

1188
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:47,500
I am the martyr.

1189
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:51,418
I am the gravedigger. So lucky.

1190
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:53,625
I am the Angel of Torture.

1191
01:15:54,418 --> 01:15:55,542
I am the Angel of Torment.

1192
01:16:07,667 --> 01:16:08,167
Boo!

1193
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,000
Hmm,
let's bury her.

1194
01:16:19,834 --> 01:16:21,583
I'll catch up with you.

1195
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:54,251
-Did you have fun playing that game?
-We had a ball.

1196
01:16:54,292 --> 01:16:56,500
It was like going to Disneyland.

1197
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:58,709
What did you like about it?

1198
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:02,792
Everything! It's fun.
Look, she's dead and we bury her!

1199
01:17:03,376 --> 01:17:07,834
Rahma invented this game to tell us
that life is worthless.

1200
01:17:07,917 --> 01:17:12,376
When we die,
all we take with us is a shroud.

1201
01:17:13,418 --> 01:17:15,542
Only our actions count.

1202
01:17:15,917 --> 01:17:19,376
Some cotton in both her nostrils.

1203
01:17:21,376 --> 01:17:22,750
And in her ears.

1204
01:17:23,792 --> 01:17:27,459
-And the holes down below, right?
-Yes.

1205
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:30,418
We block up all the holes.

1206
01:17:32,542 --> 01:17:34,542
-Hang on...
-Hi.

1207
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:36,292
You don't know how to play dead?

1208
01:17:36,959 --> 01:17:38,959
It's the first time that I've died.

1209
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:41,251
[speaking Arabic]

1210
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:44,418
May God grant you His infinite mercy.

1211
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,875
Forgive me if I have wronged you.

1212
01:17:47,418 --> 01:17:48,459
Rest in peace.

1213
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,418
You can kiss your sister.

1214
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:08,917
Allahu Akbar!

1215
01:18:21,834 --> 01:18:24,251
A lot of girls wear the hijab

1216
01:18:24,334 --> 01:18:26,542
because they fear being tortured
in the grave.

1217
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:30,334
It's the most terrifying
and horrendous thing,

1218
01:18:30,376 --> 01:18:32,583
so it's the most persuasive argument.

1219
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,251
For example, an adulterous woman,

1220
01:18:35,334 --> 01:18:36,875
her vagina catches fire
in the grave.

1221
01:18:38,209 --> 01:18:38,875
It burns!

1222
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:42,667
She is cooked, she burns,
everything you can think of.

1223
01:18:43,459 --> 01:18:46,126
Make her wear a dress of fire!

1224
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:48,542
Make her wear shoes of fire!

1225
01:18:50,418 --> 01:18:52,750
God, have mercy on me!

1226
01:18:52,834 --> 01:18:55,500
I would have liked to be a stone,
not a human.

1227
01:18:55,583 --> 01:19:00,292
God, have mercy. I didn't know
the day of judgment would arrive.

1228
01:19:00,376 --> 01:19:01,875
Forgive me, I didn't know.

1229
01:19:02,376 --> 01:19:03,542
Too late for that.

1230
01:19:21,334 --> 01:19:24,625
This incident happened
when Mom was in Libya.

1231
01:19:25,334 --> 01:19:27,376
We were at my aunt's house.

1232
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:34,459
The neighbor's son recited the Koran.
He had a beautiful voice.

1233
01:19:34,542 --> 01:19:36,625
We went to see them during Ramadan.

1234
01:19:37,334 --> 01:19:39,792
The son began to recite the Koran.

1235
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:42,834
I saw Ghofrane at the bedroom door.

1236
01:19:42,917 --> 01:19:45,418
She was tiptoeing,

1237
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,583
as if she was being strangled
and dragged along by force.

1238
01:19:48,667 --> 01:19:51,583
She came near to me and she fainted.

1239
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:54,418
Lord, protect us from evil.

1240
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,334
Get off me!

1241
01:19:56,418 --> 01:19:58,376
I seek refuge in the perfect
words of Allah from the Evil.

1242
01:19:58,418 --> 01:20:02,583
Rahma went to the mosque
to find out information on exorcisms.

1243
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:07,792
And to avoid her veil coming off
in front of a male exorcist,

1244
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:09,459
we found a female exorcist.

1245
01:20:09,542 --> 01:20:10,625
In the Name of Allah
with Whose name

1246
01:20:10,709 --> 01:20:11,917
nothing on earth or
in heaven can harm.

1247
01:20:14,834 --> 01:20:18,084
Come out of this body!
May you be cursed by God!

1248
01:20:24,376 --> 01:20:27,376
Who are you? Come out!
Come out, enemy of God!

1249
01:20:27,459 --> 01:20:31,376
No one can be harmed in His presence,
the name of the Lord protects you.

1250
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:37,126
There is no power and no strength
save in Allah.

1251
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:38,792
Is this all for real, Ghofrane?

1252
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:42,792
Men aren't enough for you,
you need Djinns too?

1253
01:20:43,334 --> 01:20:44,292
Huh?

1254
01:20:44,334 --> 01:20:45,292
Tell me!

1255
01:20:45,334 --> 01:20:47,542
Don't be rough, he can get violent.

1256
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:49,126
Shut up, you.

1257
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:51,251
As soon as you go to Libya,
it's a disaster.

1258
01:20:51,459 --> 01:20:55,459
I am working like a horse there,
and you, you bring me a Djinn.

1259
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:58,251
-It haunted her.
-She was haunted.

1260
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:01,084
[speaking Arabic]

1261
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:09,209
I will go back to Libya.

1262
01:21:09,292 --> 01:21:11,334
I will return there.

1263
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:19,667
And I will take the girls with me.
We will all work there.

1264
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:23,251
We will earn some money
and then we will come back.

1265
01:21:57,334 --> 01:22:01,709
There is no shame
in being a cleaning lady.

1266
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,583
You have to make an honest living.

1267
01:22:05,209 --> 01:22:08,126
Yes, I turned my girls
into cleaning ladies.

1268
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:12,209
Without any qualifications,
it's the only thing they could do.

1269
01:22:12,292 --> 01:22:15,542
That was the only work available
in Libya.

1270
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:18,959
Besides, I spent my time
running around to help them

1271
01:22:19,042 --> 01:22:21,583
where they were working, with Eya.

1272
01:22:21,667 --> 01:22:26,542
I never left them
to do exhausting jobs on their own.

1273
01:22:28,084 --> 01:22:31,750
I don't think
that I treated them unfairly.

1274
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,667
One day, Ghofrane came to see me.

1275
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:52,251
She said to me: "Don't bother
coming to help me tomorrow,

1276
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:54,042
I won't have much cleaning to do."

1277
01:22:54,084 --> 01:22:57,459
I replied: "Okay."
She gave me a lot of kisses that day.

1278
01:22:57,542 --> 01:23:00,625
I asked her:
"What are all these kisses for?"

1279
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:05,209
She was often very affectionate,
but there, it was over the top.

1280
01:23:05,292 --> 01:23:09,126
I told her:
"Stop, you'd think I were about to die."

1281
01:23:09,209 --> 01:23:11,209
She replied: "I love you, Mom."

1282
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,334
And she left.

1283
01:23:29,126 --> 01:23:30,959
-Where is your sister?
-I don't know.

1284
01:23:31,042 --> 01:23:33,583
-Where is your sister?
-In my pocket. Can't you see her?

1285
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:36,542
Are you laughing at me?
You're being a smartass?

1286
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:39,334
-Where did your sister go?
-She is in Sabratha.

1287
01:23:39,959 --> 01:23:42,167
-To do what?
-She has joined the brothers.

1288
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:43,500
What brothers?

1289
01:23:44,042 --> 01:23:46,084
Bring her back,
we're going home to Tunisia.

1290
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:49,084
Bring your sister back.
We're going home to Tunisia.

1291
01:23:49,167 --> 01:23:51,084
She won't come back
and I'm joining her.

1292
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:53,376
Bring her back, I'm telling you
we're going back home.

1293
01:23:53,459 --> 01:23:55,500
-Stop.
-I won't hit you again.

1294
01:23:55,542 --> 01:23:58,459
I begged her, I pulled my hair out,

1295
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,126
I tried everything, in vain.

1296
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:03,625
She had a piece of paper with a number
on it to contact her sister,

1297
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:05,167
but she swallowed it.

1298
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:08,000
It was the only way to find her.

1299
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:12,084
If she had given me that number,

1300
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:14,459
I could have called Ghofrane
to dissuade her.

1301
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,667
I would have easily convinced her.

1302
01:24:18,459 --> 01:24:22,126
She was very strong-willed,
you can't imagine how strong.

1303
01:24:22,167 --> 01:24:24,625
She was the incarnation of evil.

1304
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:29,000
She didn't shed one tear.
She was happy, in fact.

1305
01:24:29,251 --> 01:24:32,126
She was proud that her sister had left.

1306
01:24:33,126 --> 01:24:34,167
She was...

1307
01:24:35,042 --> 01:24:37,042
She wouldn't yield.

1308
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:42,459
It's hard to describe.

1309
01:24:44,959 --> 01:24:46,917
She had taken away my little girl.

1310
01:24:52,209 --> 01:24:58,042
Everything became dark,
after Ghofrane left.

1311
01:25:04,084 --> 01:25:08,625
I hated Rahma, that day.

1312
01:25:10,084 --> 01:25:13,084
When she left too,
it didn't bother me at all.

1313
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:17,251
Ghofrane didn't see
how sad I was after she left,

1314
01:25:17,292 --> 01:25:19,292
but Rahma, she saw my distress.

1315
01:25:34,334 --> 01:25:35,542
That's enough.

1316
01:26:08,042 --> 01:26:11,042
Do me a favor, arrest her.

1317
01:26:11,126 --> 01:26:12,834
She is going to join her sister.

1318
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:14,792
I have all the information.

1319
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:18,126
She's planned it all
with a people smuggler.

1320
01:26:18,167 --> 01:26:23,126
He is going to give her money
and take her there.

1321
01:26:25,042 --> 01:26:29,126
She wants to take her little sisters,
who are eight and ten, with her.

1322
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:36,167
-How old are you?
-15 years old.

1323
01:26:37,334 --> 01:26:39,167
Do you think you are a jihadist?

1324
01:26:39,209 --> 01:26:40,167
Do you?

1325
01:26:40,209 --> 01:26:45,000
I've never claimed to be one.
I work for the Tunisian State.

1326
01:26:45,084 --> 01:26:48,334
-Are you proud? What State?
-I am very proud.

1327
01:26:48,376 --> 01:26:52,000
-We are the State.
-What State are you talking about?

1328
01:26:52,084 --> 01:26:55,959
She has pledged allegiance
to their State of Daesh.

1329
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,834
Their so-called State.

1330
01:26:57,917 --> 01:26:59,834
The Islamic State, please!

1331
01:26:59,917 --> 01:27:01,209
The Islamic State.

1332
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,792
That is my State.
It is the State for all of us.

1333
01:27:03,834 --> 01:27:06,834
You should study
and think about your future.

1334
01:27:06,875 --> 01:27:10,126
-I am thinking about everyone's future.
-Everyone's future?

1335
01:27:10,459 --> 01:27:12,000
You want us to chop off hands?

1336
01:27:12,084 --> 01:27:15,042
Yes, chop off hands, heads, feet.

1337
01:27:15,167 --> 01:27:18,209
It doesn't matter,
as long as we are applying God's law.

1338
01:27:18,292 --> 01:27:19,167
What ambition!

1339
01:27:19,209 --> 01:27:22,084
You are a lost sheep, wake up.

1340
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,917
If I were you, I would take off
that uniform.

1341
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
A defiled uniform.

1342
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:29,042
So I can wear the niqab like you?

1343
01:27:29,126 --> 01:27:30,709
Are you female?

1344
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:31,875
Female...

1345
01:27:32,292 --> 01:27:33,292
You will see.

1346
01:27:34,418 --> 01:27:36,875
-I will crush you.
-Lower your hand.

1347
01:27:36,959 --> 01:27:37,959
Lower my hand?

1348
01:27:38,042 --> 01:27:39,917
You don't have the right to touch me.

1349
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,834
-Get your hand off.
-Shut your mouth when I'm talking.

1350
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:45,376
Shut up and look at the floor.
Understood?

1351
01:27:45,418 --> 01:27:48,376
-Get your hand off!
-Look at the ground! Shut it!

1352
01:27:48,459 --> 01:27:49,709
Are you happy now?

1353
01:27:49,792 --> 01:27:51,875
I'll throw you into solitary.

1354
01:27:51,917 --> 01:27:54,000
Little shit. Sit down!

1355
01:27:54,042 --> 01:27:55,334
Sit down.

1356
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,418
I will show you how much of a man I am.

1357
01:28:01,418 --> 01:28:05,167
-Get out, while I speak to your mom.
-Get out!

1358
01:28:05,251 --> 01:28:06,084
Get out, I said!

1359
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,792
You want the truth?
There's nothing I can do.

1360
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,959
-What do you mean?
-I can't do anything.

1361
01:28:22,334 --> 01:28:23,834
This is a joke!

1362
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,418
-What did you expect?
-Apply the law.

1363
01:28:26,459 --> 01:28:30,334
I am actually applying the law.
I have to follow procedure.

1364
01:28:30,418 --> 01:28:34,418
I call the prosecutor
and he decides if we detain her.

1365
01:28:35,084 --> 01:28:38,709
If she comes back to blow up
this police station, what do we do?

1366
01:28:38,792 --> 01:28:42,334
Even if she comes back,
there's nothing I can do.

1367
01:28:42,418 --> 01:28:45,209
Have you informed the prosecutor
what she is saying?

1368
01:28:45,292 --> 01:28:47,042
Of course, he knows everything.

1369
01:28:47,126 --> 01:28:51,667
They are everywhere, with their flags.
They preach through loudspeakers.

1370
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,000
The prosecutor sees them.

1371
01:28:53,084 --> 01:28:56,126
Let them burn down the country then.
Nothing can be done.

1372
01:29:05,167 --> 01:29:08,209
On September 10, 2015
the Ministry of Home Affairs published

1373
01:29:08,292 --> 01:29:12,834
the photos of wanted terrorists,

1374
01:29:12,917 --> 01:29:15,459
two of whom are sisters,
Rahma and Ghofrane Chikhaoui.

1375
01:29:18,167 --> 01:29:19,834
Rahma left Tunisia

1376
01:29:19,917 --> 01:29:22,042
with a false passport,

1377
01:29:22,126 --> 01:29:23,750
headed to Libya.

1378
01:29:23,834 --> 01:29:25,292
When she arrived there,

1379
01:29:25,334 --> 01:29:27,709
she married the emir of Daesh
in Sabratha.

1380
01:29:29,209 --> 01:29:30,875
Noureddine Chouchane,

1381
01:29:30,959 --> 01:29:36,376
the man behind the terrorist attacks
which have recently rocked Tunisia.

1382
01:29:45,167 --> 01:29:48,834
They are the ones responsible,
they laid the foundations.

1383
01:29:48,917 --> 01:29:52,875
We've had nothing but problems
since this damned revolution!

1384
01:29:52,959 --> 01:29:56,292
The former minister of Home Affairs,
he allowed all this to happen.

1385
01:29:56,334 --> 01:30:00,292
He allowed the imams to preach
and to indoctrinate my daughters,

1386
01:30:00,376 --> 01:30:03,251
because they were doing it
in public spaces!

1387
01:30:03,334 --> 01:30:08,042
This mother fears that her daughters,
Eya and Tayssir,

1388
01:30:08,084 --> 01:30:12,834
will join their sisters
among the ranks of Daesh.

1389
01:30:13,209 --> 01:30:16,042
They told us that a secular education
isn't good.

1390
01:30:16,126 --> 01:30:21,875
She showed me on Facebook
how they trained children.

1391
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:24,709
And she made us listen

1392
01:30:25,209 --> 01:30:30,292
to songs about the jihad.

1393
01:30:35,126 --> 01:30:38,209
At the time, after my sisters left,

1394
01:30:38,292 --> 01:30:42,792
my mother went on television
and there was a lot of media attention.

1395
01:30:42,917 --> 01:30:46,959
The Child Protection Officer
called my mother

1396
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:52,834
to tell her that Eya and I
were in danger.

1397
01:30:52,917 --> 01:30:55,792
Our sisters were likely to kidnap us,

1398
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:58,750
and we had to be protected.

1399
01:30:59,042 --> 01:31:05,167
He placed us in a juvenile center.

1400
01:31:08,792 --> 01:31:13,000
-What's up?
-Fine.

1401
01:31:16,209 --> 01:31:19,209
[mumbling in Arabic]

1402
01:31:21,251 --> 01:31:23,875
We arrived at the center by car.

1403
01:31:23,959 --> 01:31:26,834
It was night time
and we couldn't see a thing.

1404
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:30,251
We went through a big gate

1405
01:31:30,292 --> 01:31:34,167
and I saw a bearded man
wearing a qamis,

1406
01:31:34,251 --> 01:31:37,583
as well as a veiled woman
wearing a hijab.

1407
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:41,625
I thought that the driver
had kidnapped us

1408
01:31:41,667 --> 01:31:45,251
to deliver us to Daesh,
with Rahma and Ghofrane.

1409
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:46,709
I was scared to death.

1410
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:50,875
I grabbed Tayssir's hand to escape
as soon as he opened the door.

1411
01:31:50,959 --> 01:31:54,709
Because you think
that I would have followed you?

1412
01:31:54,792 --> 01:31:59,667
Back then, the only thing I wanted,
was to join Rahma and Ghofrane.

1413
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:03,834
I would have been so happy
to be with them.

1414
01:32:03,917 --> 01:32:07,917
That's all I wanted, at that time.

1415
01:32:09,667 --> 01:32:11,418
The first night, it was hard.

1416
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,500
Yes, it was so tough,

1417
01:32:13,583 --> 01:32:16,750
that first night when you go to sleep
far away from home,

1418
01:32:17,334 --> 01:32:21,209
surrounded by strangers,
in an unfamiliar place.

1419
01:32:21,251 --> 01:32:24,625
And you don't even know
why you are there.

1420
01:32:24,834 --> 01:32:28,167
I had a dream that night.

1421
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:31,500
My mother was very old,
and people were hitting her.

1422
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:34,667
Eya woke me up
because I was crying and screaming.

1423
01:32:34,709 --> 01:32:38,625
The next day, after lunch,
I was still sobbing.

1424
01:32:38,667 --> 01:32:43,334
They took me to see the psychologist,
and I was still screaming and crying.

1425
01:32:43,376 --> 01:32:49,126
I spent half the day screaming,
non-stop.

1426
01:32:49,209 --> 01:32:53,834
Imagine the state that this nightmare
had put me into.

1427
01:32:53,875 --> 01:32:59,167
It was when I saw my mother
like that in the dream,

1428
01:32:59,209 --> 01:33:02,542
that I began to change a bit.

1429
01:33:03,167 --> 01:33:04,750
Because in my dream,

1430
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:09,167
she ended up old and abandoned
because of Rahma and Ghofrane.

1431
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:12,334
Just thinking about it again,
it gives me the chills.

1432
01:33:12,376 --> 01:33:14,334
I see her again being trampled on
by everyone.

1433
01:33:14,376 --> 01:33:17,418
That night was horrific.

1434
01:33:17,459 --> 01:33:21,542
And it was that night
that I began to change,

1435
01:33:21,583 --> 01:33:23,418
after seeing my mother like that.

1436
01:33:25,459 --> 01:33:30,292
When we first arrived at the center,
we had a very pretty teacher.

1437
01:33:30,418 --> 01:33:32,167
God, she was so beautiful!

1438
01:33:32,376 --> 01:33:35,126
As soon as she moved,

1439
01:33:35,167 --> 01:33:39,292
Tayssir would tell her:
"God doesn't like that."

1440
01:33:39,334 --> 01:33:42,167
She kept her cool
and then she exploded:

1441
01:33:42,209 --> 01:33:45,376
"Enough of your God,
let me work!"

1442
01:33:46,334 --> 01:33:50,418
Tayssir spent her time
lecturing her: "God said..."

1443
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,834
I thought that I was God's chosen one.

1444
01:33:55,418 --> 01:33:57,418
God's little protégé.

1445
01:33:58,418 --> 01:34:00,709
God doesn't accept disrespect.

1446
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:05,625
"God doesn't accept..."
Get her out, she's starting again!

1447
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:10,126
It's true, actually.
Back then,

1448
01:34:10,542 --> 01:34:14,334
I was using God as a pretext
to defend myself.

1449
01:34:14,376 --> 01:34:18,126
And when I "abandoned God",
as they call it...

1450
01:34:20,209 --> 01:34:22,126
I found another trick.

1451
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:27,292
It turned into the Law.
We went from God to the Law.

1452
01:34:27,334 --> 01:34:30,459
And Eya supported me in that.

1453
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:33,750
We pushed ourselves
and we made the place our own.

1454
01:34:35,251 --> 01:34:38,292
It became our center.

1455
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:41,667
It was good, honestly,
despite its faults.

1456
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:42,625
For me,

1457
01:34:43,292 --> 01:34:47,000
the center was one
of the best experiences of my life.

1458
01:34:47,084 --> 01:34:48,126
Why?

1459
01:34:48,418 --> 01:34:52,625
Because before I went to the center,
I was going down another path.

1460
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:55,126
They changed my life.

1461
01:34:55,418 --> 01:34:58,126
Imagine if I hadn't gone
to the center...

1462
01:34:58,167 --> 01:35:02,750
This film would be
about all of us disappearing.

1463
01:35:27,418 --> 01:35:32,667
The two sisters were in Daesh in Libya
and wanted to go to Syria.

1464
01:35:32,709 --> 01:35:37,084
The American attack on Sabratha
put an end to their plan.

1465
01:35:38,042 --> 01:35:40,251
Rahma had texted her mother

1466
01:35:40,459 --> 01:35:43,542
to inform her of the situation
in Sabratha.

1467
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:46,542
I AM LIKELY TO DIE.
PRAY FOR ME. RAHMA

1468
01:36:22,583 --> 01:36:26,000
Our camera was the first
to find Rahma and Ghofrane

1469
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:28,000
in Mitiga prison in Tripoli.

1470
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:34,084
We approached the unit

1471
01:36:34,167 --> 01:36:36,251
who arrested Rahma and Ghofrane

1472
01:36:36,709 --> 01:36:38,667
after the Sabratha attack.

1473
01:36:41,126 --> 01:36:44,251
My daughter is five months old.
She is still in Sabratha.

1474
01:36:44,542 --> 01:36:46,376
They haven't brought her to me.

1475
01:36:47,042 --> 01:36:48,292
Her name is Fatma.

1476
01:36:48,334 --> 01:36:51,209
-How old is she?
-Five months.

1477
01:36:52,167 --> 01:36:55,292
It's been two days now
since I last saw her.

1478
01:36:55,583 --> 01:36:57,251
Please...

1479
01:36:58,376 --> 01:37:01,126
Show me the photos.

1480
01:37:01,209 --> 01:37:03,209
What is she like?

1481
01:37:03,251 --> 01:37:06,209
She's so little.

1482
01:37:08,209 --> 01:37:11,000
[speaking Arabic]

1483
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,167
-Would you recognize your daughter?
-Yes!

1484
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:21,126
My baby!

1485
01:37:24,126 --> 01:37:26,251
Don't cry, my little girl.

1486
01:38:02,167 --> 01:38:04,084
She is afraid for her babies.

1487
01:38:04,126 --> 01:38:07,126
You know, Kaouther, I am like her.

1488
01:38:07,167 --> 01:38:10,000
They say that a cat...
No, don't scratch me.

1489
01:38:10,209 --> 01:38:12,542
Is so afraid for her babies
that she eats them.

1490
01:38:14,126 --> 01:38:18,292
I was so afraid for them
that I was unable to protect them.

1491
01:38:19,418 --> 01:38:22,042
I didn't eat them, but I lost them.

1492
01:38:26,459 --> 01:38:29,042
I've told the whole story in this film,

1493
01:38:29,126 --> 01:38:33,500
to totally put the past behind me.

1494
01:38:34,126 --> 01:38:36,251
Because it is a very painful past.

1495
01:38:37,167 --> 01:38:42,084
A past that has shaped my life
and that of my daughters.

1496
01:38:42,126 --> 01:38:44,167
But I'm even more afraid
of the future.

1497
01:38:44,209 --> 01:38:47,209
-Why?
-It scares me more than the past.

1498
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,334
You're not fed up of being scared?

1499
01:38:49,376 --> 01:38:51,583
In all honesty, what scares me,

1500
01:38:52,209 --> 01:38:57,000
is that I repeated
everything that my mother did to me.

1501
01:38:57,042 --> 01:38:58,875
Almost to the letter.

1502
01:38:59,376 --> 01:39:00,875
Why do you think that is?

1503
01:39:00,917 --> 01:39:02,251
It's a curse.

1504
01:39:03,418 --> 01:39:06,251
That's how I explain it
to my daughters.

1505
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:10,084
Like she said to you,
she put us through

1506
01:39:10,126 --> 01:39:11,542
everything she went through.

1507
01:39:11,583 --> 01:39:17,084
It's not because she's a bad person,
that's just the way things are.

1508
01:39:17,126 --> 01:39:19,167
She made us go through the same thing.

1509
01:39:19,418 --> 01:39:23,084
We always pass on the education
that we receive from our mothers

1510
01:39:23,126 --> 01:39:25,917
to our daughters,
and so on.

1511
01:39:25,959 --> 01:39:28,542
Until a generation comes along

1512
01:39:29,418 --> 01:39:31,583
that breaks the chain.

1513
01:39:32,917 --> 01:39:36,834
You have to understand
that they are that generation.

1514
01:39:37,542 --> 01:39:40,875
The only one who can come out of this,
is Tayssir.

1515
01:39:40,917 --> 01:39:41,875
Eya too, in part.

1516
01:39:41,959 --> 01:39:44,167
But for Ghofrane and Rahma,
it is too late.

1517
01:39:44,251 --> 01:39:47,126
Ghofrane's daughter,
she will hold her to account.

1518
01:39:47,209 --> 01:39:49,209
She will never leave her in peace.

1519
01:39:49,583 --> 01:39:53,126
Her daughter doesn't know outdoors,
she doesn't know sunshine.

1520
01:39:53,167 --> 01:39:56,000
The curse will continue.

1521
01:40:06,376 --> 01:40:10,792
Jdaida Prison, Libya

1522
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,959
There are so many things
I want to say to them.

1523
01:40:53,834 --> 01:40:55,126
Rahma...

1524
01:40:55,834 --> 01:40:58,292
I can't see myself loving anyone

1525
01:40:58,334 --> 01:41:02,084
with a love as strong
as the one that I had for Rahma.

1526
01:41:03,459 --> 01:41:08,334
She wasn't just my sister,
she was my whole world.

1527
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Maybe I even loved her more
than I loved my parents.

1528
01:41:15,042 --> 01:41:16,959
I really did love her.

1529
01:41:17,792 --> 01:41:21,834
It's true that I was young
when she left me.

1530
01:41:22,959 --> 01:41:27,834
But despite what I've been through,

1531
01:41:27,875 --> 01:41:30,875
the most beautiful period of my life

1532
01:41:30,917 --> 01:41:35,917
is that which I spent with Rahma.

1533
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,792
I would like to tell her:
"I love you so much,

1534
01:41:40,084 --> 01:41:41,959
I will never forget you."

1535
01:41:47,251 --> 01:41:51,459
I can't even say their name out loud,
it's just too painful.

1536
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,750
I cry in silence,

1537
01:41:53,792 --> 01:42:00,750
rather than saying to myself:
"Rahma, Ghofrane, I miss you."

1538
01:42:02,834 --> 01:42:04,376
Sometimes, I'm so mad at them.

1539
01:42:04,418 --> 01:42:08,042
One day, they called from the prison
and Tayssir cried.

1540
01:42:08,084 --> 01:42:10,418
That annoyed me:
"Why are you crying?

1541
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:13,875
They're the ones who left,
it's their problem.

1542
01:42:13,917 --> 01:42:17,917
Do you want them to come back
and ruin our lives?"

1543
01:42:17,959 --> 01:42:20,251
I regretted those words so much.

1544
01:42:22,126 --> 01:42:24,917
I can't even begin to tell you
how I felt that night.

1545
01:42:26,418 --> 01:42:30,792
You can't imagine
how mad I was at myself.

1546
01:42:30,834 --> 01:42:32,292
It was like I was crazy.

1547
01:42:32,792 --> 01:42:37,959
I spent the night pulling my hair out.

1548
01:42:39,959 --> 01:42:41,667
In the morning,

1549
01:42:41,709 --> 01:42:46,959
I hid myself
to throw away the hair I'd pulled out.

1550
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:51,792
Handfuls of it,

1551
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:57,042
that I secretly threw in the trash.

1552
01:42:58,334 --> 01:43:00,625
Because I'd said bad things
about them.

1553
01:43:00,667 --> 01:43:03,875
It was selfish to say
that they should never return.

1554
01:43:07,126 --> 01:43:09,418
I know that Ghofrane has a daughter.

1555
01:43:09,917 --> 01:43:11,834
I don't know what she is like.

1556
01:43:14,209 --> 01:43:16,000
I just want to say to them:

1557
01:43:16,875 --> 01:43:20,875
"This family that has destroyed you,
I won't let it destroy me."

1558
01:43:58,667 --> 01:44:02,709
Fatma has been raised in prison in Libya.
She is now 8 years old.

1559
01:44:04,459 --> 01:44:09,500
In January 2023, Libya sentenced Rahma
and Ghofrane to 16 years in prison.

1560
01:44:11,917 --> 01:44:17,042
Olfa, Eya and Tayssir are still hopeful
that Tunisia will repatriate them.
