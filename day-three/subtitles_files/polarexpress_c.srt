1
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,049
On Christmas Eve, many years ago...

2
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,635
...I lay quietly in my bed.

3
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,138
I did not rustle the sheets.

4
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,641
I breathed slowly and silently.

5
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:04,480
I was listening for a sound
I was afraid I'd never hear.

6
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:09,986
The ringing bells of Santa's sleigh.

7
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,076
All right. All right, Sarah...

8
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,577
...you had your water.

9
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,830
Now let's get you upstairs
and into bed.

10
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,582
But, I have to...

11
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,088
He said Santa would have to
fly faster than the speed of light...

12
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:56,092
...to get to every house in one night.
And to hold everyone's presents...

13
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,928
...his sled would be bigger
than an ocean liner.

14
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:03,099
Your brother said that? He was just
kidding you. He knows there's a Santa.

15
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,936
He said he wasn't sure.
He wasn't sure if Santa was for real.

16
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,189
Of course Santa's for real.
He's as real as Christmas itself.

17
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,691
But he won't come...

18
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,985
...until you're sound asleep,
young lady.

19
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,779
Sweet dreams.

20
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,949
Santa will be here before you know it.

21
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,868
So go to sleep.

22
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,040
"Stark, barren.

23
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,754
Devoid of life."

24
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,934
He's gotta be asleep by now.

25
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,810
He used to stay awake all night...

26
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,146
...waiting for Santa.

27
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,858
Think those days are just about over.

28
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,985
That would be sad if that were true.

29
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,656
Yeah, an end of the magic.

30
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,368
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

31
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,627
See, he's out like a light.

32
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,964
An express train
wouldn't wake him up now.

33
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,386
"End of the magic"?

34
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:19,021
All aboard!

35
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:26,237
All aboard!

36
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,559
Well? You coming?

37
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,061
Where?

38
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,397
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

39
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:05,401
This is the Polar Express.

40
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,070
The North Pole?

41
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,240
I see.

42
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,741
Hold this, please.

43
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,910
Thank you.

44
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,538
Is this you?

45
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,167
- Yeah.
- Well, it says here...

46
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:26,005
...no photo with a department-store
Santa this year, no letter to Santa.

47
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,842
And you made your sister
put out the milk and cookies.

48
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,678
Sounds to me like
this is your crucial year.

49
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:37,224
If I were you, I would think
about climbing on board.

50
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,440
Come on, come on, come on.
I've got a schedule to keep...

51
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,528
Suit yourself.

65
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,552
Hey. Hey, you. Yeah, you.
Do you know what kind of train this is?

66
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,887
Train.

67
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,223
Do you know what kind of train this is?
Well, do you?

68
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,727
Of course.

69
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,062
It's a magic train.

70
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,566
- We're going to the North Pole.
- I know it's a magic train.

71
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,319
Actually it's a Baldwin 2-8-4 S3-class
steam locomotive...

72
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:58,407
...built in 1931 at the Baldwin Locomotive
Works. It weighs 456,100 pounds and...

73
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,743
Are we really going to the North Pole?

74
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,245
- Hey, look, everybody!
- Isn't that wonderful?

75
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,748
Herpolsheimer's! Herpolsheimer's!

76
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,840
Look at all those presents.
I want all of them.

77
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,094
It's so Christmassy and cozy
and beautiful!

78
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,518
Tickets.

79
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,104
Tickets, please.

80
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,856
Tickets.

81
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,277
Ticket, please.

82
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,780
Try your pocket.

83
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,789
Try your other pocket.

84
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,516
Thank you, sir.

85
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,111
Hey, watch out, there.

86
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,946
Thank you, sir.

87
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:23,325
That is a public-address
microphone. It is not a toy.

88
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,577
Boy, that guy sure likes to show off.

89
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,539
Look what that wise guy
punched on my ticket.

90
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:35,045
- "L-E." What the heck does that mean?
- Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

91
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,257
We're heading for the other side
of the tracks.

92
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,984
Well? You coming?

93
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,861
It's just another pickup.

94
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,531
That's weird. I thought you were
supposed to be the last one.

95
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,867
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

96
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,870
This is the Polar Express.

97
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,083
Suit yourself.

98
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,199
Hey, that kid wants
to get on the train.

99
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,118
Come on!

100
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,122
Hurry up!

101
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,922
We have to stop the train.

102
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,633
- I don't know how.
- Pull the emergency brake!

103
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,457
Who in the blazes applied
that emergency brake?!

104
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,084
He did.

105
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,961
You.

106
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:44,299
In case you didn't know, that cord
is for emergency purposes only.

107
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:49,263
And in case you weren't aware,
tonight is Christmas Eve.

108
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,475
And in case you hadn't noticed,
this train is on a very tight schedule.

109
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:57,646
Now, young man, Christmas
may not be important to some people...

110
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,275
...but it is very important
to the rest of us!

111
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,943
But... But...

112
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,697
He was just trying to stop the train
so that kid could get on.

113
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,327
I see. Young man,
is that what happened?

114
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,834
Well...

115
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,796
Let me remind you we are
on a very tight schedule.

116
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,173
And I've never been late before...

117
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,135
...and I am certainly not
going to be late tonight.

118
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:32,306
Now, everybody, take your seats, please!

119
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,269
Thank you.

120
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,691
Your attention, please.

121
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:47,362
Are there any Polar Express passengers
in need of refreshment?

122
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,532
- Me! Me! Me!
- I thought so.

154
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,423
You know, Montezuma,
the king of the Aztecs...

155
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,135
...would drink 50 quarts
of hot chocolate every day.

156
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,972
It was thick as mud and red.
He put chili pepper in instead of sugar.

157
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,559
- Get it? Hot chocolate?
- How do you know? That's not true.

158
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,478
- Where you going with that?
- It's for him.

159
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:48,066
- I don't think we're to leave our seats.
- It's a violation of safety regulations...

160
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,361
...for a kid to cross moving cars
without a grown-up.

161
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,113
I think I'll be okay.

162
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,657
Are you sure?

163
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,587
What about this lad in the back?
Did he get any refreshment?

164
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,883
Well, let's take some to him,
by all means.

165
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,431
Watch your step, now. Watch your step.

166
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,519
She forgot her ticket.

167
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,105
It hasn't been punched.

168
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,109
Hey, what are you doing?
You're gonna get us all in trouble!

169
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:05,180
Young lady, forgive me.

170
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:08,934
I believe I have neglected
to punch your ticket.

171
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,936
May I?

172
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,857
I left my ticket right here on the seat.

173
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,360
- But it's gone.
- You mean...

174
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,820
...you have lost your ticket.

175
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,864
She didn't lose her ticket.

176
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,867
I did.

177
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,537
I was trying to return it to you.

178
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,582
But the wind blew it out of my hand.

179
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,462
You can have my ticket.

180
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:45,720
These tickets are not transferable.

181
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,722
Young lady...

182
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,017
...you will just have to
come along with me.

183
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,489
You know what's gonna happen now?
He's gonna throw her off the train.

184
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,575
Yeah, he's gonna probably throw
her right off the rear platform.

185
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,329
Standard procedure. That way,
she won't get sucked under the wheels.

186
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,749
They may slow the train down,
but they're never gonna stop it.

187
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,084
Stop it?

188
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,087
That's it! I have to stop the train again.

189
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,548
No, please, don't do that again.

190
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,789
Where'd they go?

191
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,875
What happened to them?

192
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,961
Please, she's in big trouble.
You have to help me.

193
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,292
Hey!

194
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,172
Hey!

195
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,093
I found your ticket! Wait!

196
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,013
Hey!

197
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,516
Wait!

198
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,143
I have your ticket!

199
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,390
Is there something I can do for you?

200
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,559
I'm looking for a girl.

201
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,561
A gi...?

202
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,193
Ain't we all?

203
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,863
I have her ticket.

204
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,533
Well, lookie. Lookie here. What is this?

205
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:58,246
This is an official, authentic,
genuine ticket to ride.

206
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,916
You better keep this in
a safe place, young man.

207
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,543
If I was you...

208
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,379
I keep all my valuables right here.

209
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,715
Right here in the old size 13.

210
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,092
Experience shows
this is the safest place.

211
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,596
Not that I have much use for those.

212
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,055
Tickets.

213
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,765
I ride for free.

214
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:22,770
Yeah, yeah. I hop aboard this
rattler any time I feels like it.

215
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,023
I own this train.
Yeah.

216
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:29,611
It's like I'm the king of this train.
Yeah. The king of the Pol Ex.

217
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:35,909
In fact, I am the king
of the North Pole!

218
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,954
Where's my manners?
Sit, sit. Sit.

219
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,789
Take a load off.

220
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,292
Hey, would you like some Joe?

221
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,964
Nice hot refreshment.
Perfect for a cold winter's night.

222
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,893
There. Bless you.

223
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,980
What about Santa?

224
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:09,817
- Santa?
- Isn't he the king of the North Pole?

225
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,238
You mean this guy?

226
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:33,007
What exactly is your persuasion
on the big man?

227
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,509
Since you brought him up.

228
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,846
Well, I...

229
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,182
I want to believe.

230
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,103
- But...
- But you don't wanna be bamboozled.

231
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,356
You don't wanna be
led down the primrose path.

232
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:52,694
You don't wanna be conned or duped,
have the wool pulled over your eyes.

233
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:57,031
Hoodwinked. You don't wanna be
taken for a ride, railroaded.

234
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,913
Seeing is believing.

235
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:05,873
Am I right?

236
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,377
But what about this train?

237
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,380
What about it?

238
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,550
We're all really going
to the North Pole...

239
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:16,926
...aren't we?

240
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,512
Aren't we?

241
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,892
Are you saying
that this is all just a dream?

242
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,688
You said it, kid. Not me.

243
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:36,195
So let's go find that girl.

244
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,579
One other thing.

245
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,999
Do you believe in ghosts?

246
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,588
Interesting.

247
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,759
Wait.

248
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,429
Wait!

249
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,937
Wait!

250
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,444
I have to wake up.

251
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,696
Yeah.
I have to wake up.

252
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,283
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

253
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,702
Wake up!

254
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:31,459
Wake up, wake up.
Wake up, wake up!

255
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:43,763
Kid!

256
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,140
Kid, get your head out of the clouds!

257
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,809
Wake up, kid!

258
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:51,813
There's no sleepwalking
on the Polar Express.

259
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,649
We gotta jump them knuckles.

260
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,320
Come on, kid. Flip my shoulders.

261
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,322
Grab my lily.

262
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:06,452
That skirt you're chasing
must have moved on ahead.

263
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:11,040
- We gotta hightail it to the hog, pronto.
- To the hog?

264
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:15,169
The engine. The engine, you tenderfoot.

265
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,589
We gotta make the engine
before we hit Flat Top Tunnel.

266
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,425
How come?

267
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,177
So many questions.

268
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:27,974
There is but one inch of clearance
between the roof of this rattler...

269
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:31,018
...and the roof of Flat Top Tunnel.

270
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,062
Savvy?

271
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,193
It's just the run up to the hump, kid.

272
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,696
This will be interesting.

273
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,637
Get back on, kid. Hurry!

274
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,098
Grab my muck stick.

275
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,261
There's only one trick to this, kid.

276
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,931
When I say "jump"...

277
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:56,270
...you jump!

278
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,296
You. I thought you got thrown off, and...

279
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,466
- You're driving the train?
- They put me in charge.

280
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:29,095
- The engineer had to check the light.
- Here's the light. Careful.

281
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,930
All right, now.

282
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,933
I got it.

283
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:40,773
- How do you know how?
- It's easy. Come here, I'll show you.

284
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,401
This big lever here, that's the throttle.

285
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,653
This little one here, that's the brake.

286
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,739
And those are the pressure gauges.

287
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,492
And that rope is the whistle.

288
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,495
The whistle.

289
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,581
You wanna try it?

290
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,794
I've wanted to do that my whole life.

291
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,135
Hold still! Hold still! Don't move!

292
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:11,345
Look!

293
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:27,028
Stop the train! Stop the train!

294
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,864
Stop the train!

295
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,535
What?

296
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,203
They want us to stop the train.

297
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,041
- Which one is the brake?
- He told me this was.

298
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,876
- Who?
- The engineer.

299
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:46,714
- The engineer? This one looks like a brake.
- No, he said this was the brake.

300
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:47,882
Are you sure?

301
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,718
Are you sure?

302
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,519
Pull the brake!

303
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,563
Stop the train!

304
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,916
Caribou?

305
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:26,045
- Ugh.
- There's no Christmas...

306
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,339
...without the Polar Express
arriving on time.

307
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,759
Am I the only one who understands that?

308
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,762
You. I should have known.

309
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,766
Are you bound and determined that
this train never reaches the North Pole?

310
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,559
But look.

311
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,437
Caribou crossing?!

312
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:48,067
I make that herd to be at least
100,000, maybe even a million.

313
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:51,278
It's gonna be hours
before they clear this track.

314
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,533
- A tough nut to crack.
- We are in some serious jelly.

315
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,119
- And a jam.
- Tight spot.

316
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,620
- Up a creek.
- Up a tree.

317
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,834
- Lost in the grass.
- Our a...

318
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:49,879
Problem solved.
All ahead, slow.

319
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,718
We're going pretty fast.

320
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,805
Tell the engineer to slow down.

321
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,728
Slow it down.

322
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,399
Watch the speed!

323
00:35:56,738 --> 00:36:00,491
Jumping jeepers,
the cotter pin sheared off.

324
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,909
- What?
- The pin.

325
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,245
- Where?
- There.

326
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,996
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

327
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,835
- They can't hear me.
- They can't?

328
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:16,131
I don't like the look of this.
Quick, under the safety bar.

329
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,010
Is everything all right?
What should we do?

330
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:24,098
Well, considering the fact that we have
lost communication with the engineer...

331
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,893
...we are standing totally exposed
on the front of the locomotive...

332
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:31,230
...the train appears to be
accelerating uncontrollably...

333
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:35,234
...and we are rapidly
approaching Glacier Gulch...

334
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:38,904
...which just happens to be the steepest
downhill grade in the world...

335
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:42,366
...I suggest we all hold on...

336
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,410
...tightly!

337
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:07,141
- The pin.
- The pin.

338
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:30,581
Jiminy Christmas, the ice has frozen
over the tracks.

339
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,147
Hold on. Hold on. No, no.

340
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:58,192
Come on. Watch your step.

341
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,570
Come on, sweetie.
Up you go. Up you go.

342
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:06,492
Put your feet on here.
On here.

343
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,329
Little adventure?

344
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,873
Young man, quick thinking on your part.

345
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,730
Step to your left, please. To your left.

346
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,113
Well, that is more like it.

347
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,534
What in the name of Mike?

348
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,747
Look.

349
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:59,169
Get us the blazes out of here!

350
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,013
Turn this sled around.

351
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,907
Look there.

352
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,953
Tracks.

353
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,538
Dead ahead.

354
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,462
Right.

355
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,302
Left.

356
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,808
Right.

357
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,980
Hang a Louie.

358
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,485
Toss a Ritchie.

359
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,490
Port astern.

360
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,494
To the starboard.

361
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,414
- My slipper.
- You're gonna lose your ticket.

362
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,458
It's not my ticket, it's yours.

363
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,460
- It's my ticket?
- Yes.

364
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,754
Right. Keep up with me. Left.

365
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,507
Right. Left.

366
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:31,845
Right.

367
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:33,514
Left.

368
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,015
Right.

369
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,184
Left. Right.

370
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,189
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

371
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,235
Brace yourselves!

372
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,206
Well, that's more like it.

373
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,127
Thank you.

374
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,547
Thank you. I can't believe
you found my ticket.

375
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,758
Did someone say they found a ticket?

376
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:15,180
Well, in that case... Tickets, please.

377
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,566
Thank you.

378
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,238
- "L-E"?
- Hey, just like that know-it-all kid.

379
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,504
Watch your step.

380
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,924
Tricky walking up here. It's mighty slick.
Mighty slick, I tell you.

381
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:55,012
There you go.
What did I tell you?

382
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:00,267
Years ago, on my first Christmas Eve run,
I was up on the roof making my rounds...

383
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,394
...when I slipped on the ice myself.

384
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,939
I reached out for a hand iron,
but it broke off. I slid and fell.

385
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:10,110
And yet, I did not fall off this train.

386
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,946
Someone saved you?

387
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,115
Or something.

388
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,328
An angel.

389
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,914
Maybe.

390
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,124
Wait. Wait.

391
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,128
What did he look like? Did you see him?

392
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:33,133
No, sir. But sometimes
seeing is believing.

393
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:38,639
And sometimes the most real things
in the world are the things we can't see.

394
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:46,855
The forsaken and the abandoned.

395
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:51,985
Mind your step, now.
These poor toys have suffered enough...

396
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:56,490
...being left to rust and decay in the
back alleys and vacant lots of the world.

397
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,825
What are they doing here?

398
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,161
It's a new concept
the boss came up with.

399
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,748
Instead of being thrown away,
they're collected. Refurbished.

400
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:10,504
He calls it "rebicycling."
Something like that.

401
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:15,175
Makes me wanna cry...

402
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:18,512
...seeing toys that were
treated this way.

403
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,431
These hopelessly entangled...

404
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,517
...string puppets and marionettes...

405
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:28,021
...pose a particular problem. We found
the nimble fingers of our work force...

406
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:32,526
...here at the North Pole are best
for working out those knots and tangles.

407
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:35,195
Thank you.
Double-locked here.

408
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,043
You are just like me, my friend.

409
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,629
A scrooge!

410
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,965
Ebenezer Scrooge.

411
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:58,468
North Pole, Santa Claus, this train...

412
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,556
...it's all a bunch of humbug.
A bout of indigestion.

413
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:05,309
Yeah.
I know what you are.

414
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,061
You're a doubter.

415
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,814
A doubter. You don't believe!

416
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:14,151
You're a doubter! You don't believe!

417
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:34,171
Hey, you missed it.
We rode down some really sharp hills.

418
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,006
We were on what looked like
a frozen lake.

419
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,717
But I know it was just an optical illusion
caused by moonlight.

420
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,762
He said the train was on ice.
But I said that's impossible...

421
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,681
You can't put a train track...

The northern lights.

450
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,710
Hey. You three.

451
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,713
We just crossed it.

452
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:27,260
Latitude 66◦33'.
The Arctic Circle.

453
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:30,764
And do you see?
Those lights in the distance.

454
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:36,186
They look like the lights of a strange
ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.

455
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,439
There...

456
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:42,192

469
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:31,658
We made it.

470
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:59,853
There should be elves.
Where are the elves?

471
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:01,688
Yeah, where are the elves?

472
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,190
They are gathering
in the center of the city.

473
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:08,194
That is where Santa will give
the first gift of Christmas.

474
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,531
Who gets the first gift of Christmas?

475
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:15,535
He will choose one of you.

476
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:21,541
- Look.
- Elves!

477
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,741
All right. All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

478
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:57,661
Two columns, if you please.

479
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,580
Shorter in the front, taller in the rear.

480
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:04,751
Even-numbered birthdays on the right,
odd-numbered on the left.

481
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,837
No pushing. No pushing.
But let's not dilly-dally.

482
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,923
It's five minutes to midnight.

483
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:13,677
Hey, what gives? It was five minutes
till midnight four minutes ago.

484
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,596
Exactly. Columns of two.

485
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,932
- One, two.
- Excuse me.

486
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,559
- Question.
- What about him?

487
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:27,023
No one is required to see Santa.

488
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:31,361
Ladies and gentlemen,
you do not have to hold hands...

489
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,948
- Come on.
- ...but please remain in your columns...

490
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:37,534
...while we are in transit.

491
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:50,630
- Look, you have to come with us.
- She's right.

492
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:57,053
Christmas just doesn't work out
for me. Never has.

493
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,806
But Christmas is such a wonderful,
beautiful time.

494
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:03,643
It's a time for giving and being thankful,
for friends and family.

495
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:08,606
People hang decorations and lights. Santa
leaves presents under our Christmas trees.

496
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,277
Christmas just...

497
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:14,738
...doesn't work out for me.

498
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,243
Look, I don't know if Christmas
is gonna work out for you or not...

499
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:23,496
...but this is Christmas Eve.
Don't stay here by yourself.

500
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,750
Yes, come with us.

501
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,085
We'll go together.

502
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:42,807
Oh, no.

503
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,692
We're gonna be okay.

504
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:57,197
Maybe not!

505
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,034
The emergency brake.

506
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:03,161
The emergency brake.

507
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,668
There's no brake. I can't find the brake!

508
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:19,719
Take a break, kid.

509
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:23,556
How about a nice, good hot cup of Joe?

510
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:53,253
We're gonna crash!

511
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,220
We're spinning.

512
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:29,956
You hear that?

513
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,791
The bell.

514
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,587
- What bell?
- The sleigh bell.

515
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,131
- Sleigh bell?
- Don't you hear it?

516
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:42,051
It's coming from that tunnel.

517
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,726
That's the way we should go.

518
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,736
Come on.

519
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,519
What?

520
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,439
- What?
- Come on.

521
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:49,702
Come on.

522
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,297
We're lost.

523
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,684
Yes.

524
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:16,854
- Yes. I hear it.
- I hear it too.

525
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:21,067
- I don't hear anything.
- Okay, it's down this way.

526
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,485
Are you sure?

527
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,282
Absolutely.

528
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:36,624
Why can't I hear anything?

529
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:40,753
Get down and be quiet.

530
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:55,101
Yeah.

531
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,853
Okay.

532
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,897
Well, that was the wrapping hall, chief.

533
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,608
- Just finished the last one.
- How's it wrapped?

534
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:06,738
It's wrapped in candy-striped red
with a number-seven holly-green bow.

535
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:10,199
A number-seven bow?
When we're this close to liftoff?

536
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,786
What are they thinking down there?
Are they meshuggener?

537
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,247
- What's the routing?
- Going to the States.

538
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:17,957
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

539
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,878
That's my town. I'm from Grand Rapids.

540
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:30,470
We got a troublemaker
now. Just what we need.

541
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,598
Things aren't bad enough.
What's his 20?

542
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:37,060
Apparently, some kid
from Maplewood, New Jersey...

543
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,645
...stuck some gum in his sister's hair.

544
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,316
New Jersey? Is that
the same kid that put the tack...

545
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:45,610
...underneath his teacher's chair
last year?

546
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:49,405
- No, sir. This kid's name is Steven.
- Steven.

547
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,825
So, what do we do, chief?
Alert the big man?

548
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:55,995
We talking nothing for Christmas here?

549
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,253
I didn't do it.

550
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,672
I didn't do it.

551
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,591
I didn't do it.

552
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,346
Look, it's...
It's almost Christmas?

553
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,848
We'll cut the kid a break.

554
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:18,142
But put him on the check-twice list
for next year.

555
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,020
All right, boys.

556
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,315
Let's shut it down, all right.
That's it for this year. Come on.

557
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:29,028
- Hey, boss, are we taking the pneumatic?
- Of course we're taking the pneumatic.

558
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:32,365
It's the only way to get
to the square on time.

559
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:35,785
- Let's go.
- And time is money.

560
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,163
Ready, and mount.

561
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:43,251
Good. Close.

562
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,642
All right, get in.

563
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,229
I don't know about this.

564
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:40,933
I don't hear it. Do you?

565
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:43,936
No.

566
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,065
I think we should follow those arrows.

567
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:04,790
I thought there'd be a way out.

568
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,542
We're gonna miss everything.

569
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,804
Hey, look.

570
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,807
A present.

571
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,148
It's going to my town.
To someone named Billy.

572
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:34,904
- My name is Billy.
- It's going to 11344 Edbrooke Avenue.

573
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,948
That's my address.

574
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,332
Come on.

575
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,601
Look.

576
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:52,732
It says, "Merry Christmas, Billy.
From Mr. C."

577
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:58,154
I think I know what it is.
I wanted one of these my whole life.

578
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,407
Wait, wait. Stop. Look.

579
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,661
But I...

580
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,663
Those are the rules.

581
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:10,202
Something's got me.

582
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,121
It's got my leg.

583
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:14,039
I can't hold him.

584
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:17,501
Give me your other hand.
Give me your other hand.

585
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:20,212
- I can't.
- On three.

586
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,507
One, two, three.

587
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,218
- Look.
- It's still got me.

588
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:29,722
On three again. One, two, three.

589
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:34,560
- You.
- You.

590
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,812
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.

591
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,566
Checking out my presents. Making sure
I'm getting everything on my list.

592
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:43,652
All I found was one present.
All it had was stupid underwear.

593
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,404
Look.

594
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:56,207
You may start
your descent any time now.

595
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,626
At your convenience, of course.

596
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:14,225
It's still five to.
I think we're gonna make it.

597
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:17,019
Of course we will. It's been five to
for the last hour.

598
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:20,773
We got plenty of time. We got nothing
but time. We got time to kill.

599
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:24,693
You know what?
I don't think we're gonna make it.

600
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:30,241
I may be just an old railroader...

601
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:33,202
...and know nothing about
lighter-than-air craft...

602
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:38,874
...but from my layman's perspective,
you need more altitude!

603
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,460
More altitude!

604
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:45,172
Altitude, please.
A bit more altitude, please.

605
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:48,300
Geronimo!

606
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:05,234
The Flying Elves.

607
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:08,153
They are specialists.
Do not try that at home, kids.

608
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,322
Do not try that at home.

609
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,740
We're not gonna make it.

610
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:53,616
A well-oiled machine.

611
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,534
Whew.

612
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,253
All right, you stowaways.

613
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,840
- Party's over.
- I was just following them.

614
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,884
We fell in here by mistake.

615
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:15,804
Forget about it. We knew you
was in there the whole time.

616
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,058
Come on, out you go.

617
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:22,978
Let's go, come on.
Step up, step up. There we go.

618
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:26,398
Not a problem. Come on.
Watch your step. There you go.

619
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,574
So nobody gets hurt, here's
how we're gonna get you guys down.

620
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:39,078
- This is simple. Why, I know...
- What do you know?

621
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:42,915
You're not supposed to be here
in the first place.

622
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:47,586
But since it's Christmas,
I'm gonna let you slide.

623
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,380
Hey.

624
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,675
Been looking for you.

625
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:57,179
There you go.

626
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,597
Watch your step.

627
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,683
Careful.

628
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,935
Beautiful form. Beautiful.

629
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:05,437
Nice to see you again.

630
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,109
Cutting it kind of close, aren't we?

631
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:13,862
I'll take care of this.

632
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,115
It's in good hands.

633
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:18,951
Trust me.

Aren't those bells
the most beautiful sound?

644
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,206
He's here! He's here!

645
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:12,624
Where?

646
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,127
I see him. He's over there.

647
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,795
I can't see him.

648
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:38,984
I can't see him.

649
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,987
I can't see him!

650
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:48,095
Doubter. Doubter.

651
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:53,141
Okay.

652
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:56,144
Okay.

653
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,857
I believe.

654
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:04,903
I believe.

655
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,032
I believe.

656
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:36,268
What was that you said?

657
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:43,442
I believe.

658
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,781
I believe.

659
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:55,912
I believe that this is yours.

660
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:59,166
Well...

661
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,252
Thank you.

662
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,630
- Me, me. Pick me, Santa.
- What are you doing? Stop it.

663
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:08,925
- Pick me, pick me. I want the first gift.
- Hush.

664
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,053
Young man...

665
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,055
...patience.

666
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:17,893
And a smidgen of humility
might also serve you well.

667
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:19,686
Yes, sir.

668
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,315
And you, young lady...

669
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:25,150
A lady of decision.

670
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:29,279
Full of confidence and spirit.

671
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:31,656
Christmas spirit.

672
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:35,994
Keep up the good work.

673
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:39,081
Thank you.

674
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:41,666
And Billy.

675
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:44,836
It is Billy?

676
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:49,257
I see you've made some new friends.

677
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,512
Yes, sir. I sure have.

678
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:55,931
That's a lucky lad.

679
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,517
There's no greater gift than friendship.

680
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:04,481
And speaking of gifts...

681
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,779
...let's have this young fellow
right here.

682
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,485
Now...

683
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,655
...what would you like for Christmas?

684
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,699
Me.

685
01:14:55,867 --> 01:14:57,284
You.

686
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:14,593
Yes. Indeed.

687
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,931
Yes, indeed.

688
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:30,567
The first gift of Christmas!

689
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,877
This bell is a wonderful symbol
of the spirit of Christmas...

690
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,962
...as am I.

691
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:54,925
Just remember...

692
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,802
...the true spirit of Christmas...

693
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,347
...lies in your heart.

694
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:13,652
Merry Christmas.

695
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:18,573
Better keep that in a safe place.

696
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:43,348
Hey, hey. Man alive, are you lucky.

697
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:08,206
Pull, Comet. Pull, boy!

698
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:13,545
Prancer, that's a girl.

699
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:20,468
Good boy, Donder.

700
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:56,588
Now, Dasher. Now, Prancer and Vixen.

701
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:08,516
It's everything I dreamed it would be.

702
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,435
Could all...?

703
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:13,605
Could all this be nothing but a dream?

704
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:15,273
No.

705
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,038
<i>♪ To the top of the roof
To the top of the wall ♪</i>

706
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:35,043
<i>♪ Now, dash away, dash away
Dash away all ♪</i>

707
01:19:07,535 --> 01:19:10,412
All aboard!

708
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,497
One, two. One, two, three, go.

709
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:16,501

713
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:28,263
Come on, shorty!

714
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,695
Show your tickets.
Have your tickets ready.

715
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,448
Remember to eat
the five basic food groups.

716
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,366
Ticket, please.

717
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:51,870
And please brush after every meal.

718
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:57,375
Remember to duck and cover.

719
01:19:57,585 --> 01:20:00,587
All right, you. Ticket, please.

720
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:09,679
"Lean." Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

721
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:12,140
"Lean" is spelled with four letters.

722
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,559
I believed I punched five.

723
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:19,564
Hey, are you saying
I don't know how to...?

724
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:23,026
I'm sorry. It says "learn".
My mistake.

725
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:25,069
Lesson learned.

726
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,654
Ticket.

727
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:44,923
That is some special ticket.

728
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:46,591
Sure is.

729
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:51,095
So can you count on us
to get you home safe and sound?

730
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,933
Absolutely.

731
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,601
Me...

732
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,896
...and my friends.

733
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:03,858
Ticket.

734
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:15,453
It says "lead." Like "lead balloon."

735
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:18,289
I believe it also is pronounced "lead."

736
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:20,458
As in "leader," "leadership."

737
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,794
"Lead the way."

738
01:21:22,962 --> 01:21:25,213
Follow you anywhere, ma'am.

739
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:29,384
Yes.

740
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:32,470
Young man with all the questions.

741
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:34,430
Ticket.

742
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:46,693
- It says...
- Don't...

743
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:48,570
It's nothing I need to know.

744
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:01,833
- Come on, let's see the bell.
- Let's see it.

745
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:04,669
- Come on, let's see the bell.
- Show us the bell.

746
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,005
Yeah, let's see the bell.

747
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,014
It's gone.

748
01:22:17,308 --> 01:22:20,143
- Where is it?
- I lost it.

749
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:22,854
I lost the bell from Santa's sleigh.

750
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:24,856
It's gone?

751
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:27,525
Don't worry.

752
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:30,153
- We'll... We'll find it.
- Yeah, we'll find it.

753
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:32,655
Yeah, we'll help you.
All of us.

754
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:35,658
Yeah, let's hurry out
and find it right now.

755
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:46,878
It's too late.

756
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,882
Gee, that's really too bad.

757
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,551
Really.

758
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:09,901
I'm sorry.

759
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:44,769
11344 Edbrooke.

760
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:50,441
Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

761
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,617
Hey, where you going?

762
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:01,786
Home.

763
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:05,540
Okay.
Merry Christmas.

764
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:13,464
Thanks for stopping the train for me.

765
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:20,972
Have a wonderful Christmas.

766
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,560
Watch your step, please.

767
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:29,147
And merry Christmas.

768
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:47,498
Look.

769
01:24:50,169 --> 01:24:53,004
Santa got to Billy's house already.

770
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:58,593
Look, look! Santa got here!

771
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:00,344
Isn't that amazing?

772
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:01,929
It is amazing.

773
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,439
It is amazing.

774
01:25:57,736 --> 01:26:00,071
I'm sorry about the bell.

775
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:03,324
It was a really special present.

776
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,243
Well, you know what they say.

777
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,703
It's the thought that counts.

778
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:09,831
Yeah.

779
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,876
Well, see you.

780
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:18,005
Well...

781
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,258
...see you.

782
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,593
See you.

783
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:38,943
Watch your step, please.

784
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,445
Thank you.

785
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:44,115
No, thank you.

786
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:47,702
One thing about trains:

787
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:49,954
It doesn't matter where they're going.

788
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:54,125
What matters is deciding to get on.

789
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:12,643
Merry Christmas!

790
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:17,565
What?

791
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:23,237
Merry Christmas!

792
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:36,143
Wake up. Wake up.
Santa's been here. Santa's been here.

793
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,979
Hurry up. Hurry up!

794
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:41,482
Mom, Dad, wake up. Wake up!

795
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,652
Santa's been here! Santa's been here!

796
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:48,739
Mom, Dad, look!
He brought us all kinds of stuff!

797
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:51,409
Look, a train!

798
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:13,347
This is the most beautiful-est,
most wonderful-est Christmas ever.

799
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:15,766
Wait. Look.

800
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:18,936
Here's one more.

801
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:22,398
Has your name on it.

802
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:53,888
Found this on the seat of my sleigh.

803
01:29:54,056 --> 01:29:56,724
Better fix that hole in your pocket.

804
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:58,142
Mr. C.

805
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:11,322
What a beautiful bell.
Who's it from?

806
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:13,574
- Santa.
- Santa?

807
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:15,326
Really?

808
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:18,829
- That's too bad.
- What's this?

809
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:22,333
Broken.

810
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:24,668
Sorry about that, sport.

811
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:32,343
Come on, kids.
We don't wanna be late.

812
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:43,854
At one time,
most of my friends could hear the bell.

813
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:48,109
But as years passed,
it fell silent for all of them.

814
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:53,531
Even Sarah found, one Christmas, that she
could no longer hear its sweet sound.

815
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,366
Though I've grown old...

816
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:57,952
...the bell still rings for me.

817
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:02,206
As it does for all who truly believe.
