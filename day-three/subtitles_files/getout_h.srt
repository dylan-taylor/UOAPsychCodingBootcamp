1
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,294
The thing I've
been asking myself is

2
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,772
what kind of sick individual
names a street Edgewood Way

3
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,675
and he put it half a mile away
from Edgewood Lane?

4
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,470
Huh?

5
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,177
It's crazy.

6
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:19,052
You got me out here in this
creepy, confusing ass suburb.

7
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:25,159
I'm serious, though. I feel
like a sore thumb out here.

8
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,864
All right, baby. All right,
I'll talk to you soon.

9
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,291
See you.

10
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,064
Okay,
so this is Rhine Ave.

11
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,537
It's like a fucking
hedge maze out here.

12
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,540
East...

13
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:51,720
Keep going straight and then
I think it said a left on...

14
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,017
What was that?
Peacock?

15
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:58,186
Go straight and a left on...

16
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,006
Okay.

17
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,011
All right,
just keep on walking, bruh.

18
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,877
Don't do nothin' stupid.

19
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,382
Just keep on...

20
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,685
Fuck this. I'mma fucking
go the other way I came.

21
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,749
Not today. Not me.

22
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,359
You know how they like to do
motherfuckers out here, man. I'm gone.

23
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,207
Yo... Come on, brother,
this is...

24
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,300
Yo! Yo! Hey!

25
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,103
Sid, Sid, Sid.

26
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,441
How's it goin' over there?

27
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,505
Good.

28
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,152
You got your toothbrush?

29
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,642
Check.

30
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,047
Do you have your deodorant?

31
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,657
Check.

32
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,484
Do you have your cozy clothes?

33
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,354
Got that.

34
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,824
Can you give me
a minute, Sid?

35
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,331
We gotta pry something
out of your dad.

36
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,030
What?

37
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,150
Do they know I'm black?

38
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,709
No.

39
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,315
Should they?

40
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:34,431
It seems like it's something
you might wanna, you know,

41
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,493
mention.

42
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,834
"Mom and Dad,
my black boyfriend

43
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,498
"will be coming
up this weekend

44
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,199
"and I just don't
want you to be shocked

45
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,677
"that he's a black man"

46
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,247
You said I was the first
black guy you ever dated.

47
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,337
Yeah, so what?

48
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,509
Yeah, so this is uncharted
territory for them.

49
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,520
You know, I don't wanna get chased
off the lawn with a shotgun.

50
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,087
You're not going to.
First of all,

51
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,191
my dad would've voted for Obama
a third time if he could've.

52
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,690
Like, the love is so real.

53
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,195
I'm only telling you
that 'cause he's definitely

54
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,730
gonna wanna talk
to you about that.

55
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,299
And it will definitely fucking suck.

56
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:13,302
But that's because he's a lame
dad more than anything else.

57
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,937
They are not racist.

58
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,899
All right.
I would've told you.

59
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,913
I wouldn't be
bringing you home to them.

60
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,777
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Think about
that for, like, two seconds.

61
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,041
I'm thinkin'.

62
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,209
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.

63
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,298
No, no, no.

64
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,298
Come on, I'm a grown man.
No way.

65
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,391
You broke my cigarette.

66
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,962
Seriously, you just
threw it out a window?

67
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,473
Just like a dollar. You basically
threw a dollar out the window. Great.

68
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,407
That was a dollar you decided
to spend on nicotine.

69
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,570
Yeah.
Tobacco.

70
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,304
Hold on, I gotta call Rod.

71
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,948
Oh, Rod.

72
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,583
Don't do that.

73
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,576
'Sup?

74
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,845
Yo, you at work?

75
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,321
<i>Yeah, yeah,
I'm at work.</i>

76
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,789
<i>Look, Chris,
tell me this, okay?</i>

77
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,154
How can I get in trouble

78
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:14,162
for patting down an old lady?
It's standard procedure.

79
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,596
Gary just think 'cause
an elderly bitch is elderly,

80
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,429
she can't hijack no
motherfucking plane.

81
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,161
<i>C, wait, wait, wait.
I know you laughin'.</i>

82
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,703
I'm serious, man.
The next 9/11

83
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,307
is gonna be on
some geriatric shit.

84
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,498
<i>Straight up.</i>

85
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,304
Look, man, thanks for
looking after Sid this weekend.

86
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,003
Remember, no human food.

87
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,512
He's got IBS.

88
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,013
Damn, C.
Give me some type of credit.

89
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,118
<i>Okay, I don't forget shit.
You do.</i>

90
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,844
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, all right.

91
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,615
No, I accept your apology.
It's all good.

92
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,355
How Little
Miss Rosie doin'?

93
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:41,990
She's good. She's driving.

94
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,286
Can I talk to him?
No.

95
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,860
I'd like to talk
to him, please.

96
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,861
Hold on, hold on.

97
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,299
<i>Hi, Rod!
Now, look here.</i>

98
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,957
You know you picked
the wrong guy, right'?

99
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:54,001
Yeah, of course I know that. This
is all just a ploy to get to you.

100
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,696
It's not too late for us.
Okay, get your own girl.

101
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,829
Goddamn.

102
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,909
<i>She's all mad at you 'cause
you never take my advice.</i>

103
00:09:58,998 --> 00:09:59,976
Like what?

104
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,035
<i>Like don? go to
a white girl's parents' house.</i>

105
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,175
What's she doin'? Lickin'
your balls or somethin'?

106
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,847
Yeah, bye. You know
what I'm sayin', Chris?

107
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:08,808
Chris.

108
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:10,810
Chri...

109
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,547
This motherfucker
hung up on me.

110
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,483
You're jealous.

111
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,393
I'm not jealous.
I made you jealous?

112
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,657
I'm not jealous of Rod.
It's Rod!

113
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,075
Fuck. Are you okay?

114
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,239
Yeah, that scared
the shit outta me.

115
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,409
You?
Yeah, I'm okay.

116
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,507
All right.

117
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,678
Oh, my God.

118
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,690
Fuck.

119
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,935
Stay here.
What?

120
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,940
What are you doing?

121
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,239
I don't know.

122
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,747
Well, maybe he's gone, you know?

123
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,713
Chris.

124
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,266
So, in the future, the number to
call is Animal Control Services.

125
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:17,176
Yes. Sorry about that.
I was just disoriented.

126
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,140
So you guys
coming up from the city?

127
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,185
Yeah, yeah. My parents are
from the Lake Pontaco area.

128
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,345
We're just heading up
there for the weekend.

129
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,954
Sir, can I see
your license, please?

130
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,184
Wait, why?

131
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,329
Yeah.
I have state ID.

132
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,657
No, no, no.
He wasn't driving.

133
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,357
I didn't ask who was driving.
I asked to see his ID.

134
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,799
Yeah, why? That doesn't
make any sense. Here.

135
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,996
No, no, no. Fuck that. You
don't have to give him your ID

136
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,301
'cause you haven't
done anything wrong.

137
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,865
Baby' baby, it's okay.
Come on.

138
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,137
Any time there is an incident,
we have every right to ask...

139
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,202
That's bullshit.

140
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,871
Ma'am...

141
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,720
<i>Everything all right, Ryan?</i>

142
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,049
Yeah, I'm good.

143
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,189
Get that headlight fixed.

144
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:10,724
And that mirror.

145
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,226
Thank you, Officer.

146
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,403
What?

147
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,048
That was hot.

148
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,912
Well, I'm not gonna
let anyone fuck with my man.

149
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,051
I see that.
Okay.

150
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,253
We're here.

151
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,608
It's the groundskeeper.

152
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,275
Are you ready?

153
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,724
Hi!

154
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:15,959
My little girl!
Come here!

155
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:20,002
How are you? I love you too.
I missed you.

156
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,638
This is my dad, Dean.
This is Chris.

157
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,171
Call me Mr. Armitage.

158
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,330
Of course.
How you doin'?

159
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:27,478
I'm kiddin'! You call me Dean.
And you hug me, my man.

160
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,135
How are ya?
I'm good. How are you?

161
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,645
We're huggers.
Yes.

162
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,941
This is my mom.
This is Chris.

163
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,481
Hi, welcome.

164
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,481
Nice to meet you.

165
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,414
Your father gets
really excited, but...

166
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,015
Anyway, yeah.
I'm Missy.

167
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,150
Yes. Come on in. Please, welcome.
Inside.

168
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,324
So how was your drive in?

169
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,960
It was fine.
We actually hit a deer.

170
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,662
What?
oh, no.

171
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,171
Is it dead?
Yeah.

172
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,173
That's horrible.
Are you guys all right?

173
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,369
Yeah.
it just fruck us out.

174
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,479
It did?

175
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,344
Yeah. It came outta nowhere.
We got it pretty good.

176
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,212
Yeah, it must have
frucked you out, big time.

177
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,684
Frucking weird. Well, you
know what I say?

178
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,551
I say one down, a couple
hundred thousand to go.

179
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,647
Dean.
Dad.

180
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,853
No, I don't mean to get on my
high horse, but I'm telling ya,

181
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,190
I do not like the deer. I'm sick of it.
They're taking over.

182
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,732
They're like rats. They're
destroying the ecosystem.

183
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:25,029
I see a dead deer on the side
of the road, I think to myself,

184
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,534
"That's a start."

185
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,367
I don't even
understand that.

186
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,496
I'm sorry.
I'm just sayin'.

187
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,839
You know what, lam grateful
for what you've done today.

188
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,375
I don't like 'em.

189
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,638
We got that.

190
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,736
Okay.
Yeah.

191
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,908
All right, you guys
look so wiped out.

192
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,710
Yeah, a little.
Yeah.

193
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,379
So how long has this
been going on? This...

194
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:46,879
This thang?

195
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,022
How long?

196
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:51,918
Four months.

197
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:53,690
Four months?

198
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,591
Mmm.
Five months, actually.

199
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,733
She's right, I'm wrong.

200
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,064
Attaboy. Better get
used to saying that.

201
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,875
Please, I'm so sorry.

202
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,068
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
She's right, I'm wrong.

203
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,701
See?

204
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,240
Does he have an off button?
This is exhausting.

205
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,405
I know.
I wanna give you a tour.

206
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,743
They just got...
Can we unpack first?

207
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,410
You wanna unpack?
Before the tour?

208
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,725
This is Missy's office. She
takes appointments in there.

209
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,193
She's a therapist,
right?

210
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,422
Psychiatrist, yeah.

211
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,859
Turns out people up here

212
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,694
are just as messed up in the
head as they are in the city.

213
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,028
This is Jeremy.

214
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,395
That's Rose's little brother.
There he is.

215
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,267
I've heard stories.

216
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,770
Yeah, I bet you have.

217
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:39,307
He's studying medicine now. Wants
to be just like his old man.

218
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,069
You'll meet him.
All right. Cool.

219
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,103
I picked these up in Bali.

220
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:51,484
It's pretty eclectic. I'm a
traveler and I can't help it.

221
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,289
I keep bringing
souvenirs back.

222
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,818
It's such
a privilege to be able

223
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,486
to experience
another person's culture.

224
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:00,620
You know what I'm saying?
Mmm-hmm.

225
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,794
Oh, you're gonna
love this.

226
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,493
My dads claim to fame.

227
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,733
He was beat by Jesse Owens

228
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,297
in the qualifying round for
the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

229
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,341
Those are the ones where...
Owens won in front of Hitler.

230
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,069
Yeah, what a moment.
What a moment.

231
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:19,649
I mean, Hitler's up there with all
his perfect Aryan race bullshit.

232
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:20,977
This black dude
comes along,

233
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,178
proves him wrong in front
of the entire world.

234
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,514
Amazing.

235
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,985
Tough break for
your dad though.

236
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,249
Yeah.

237
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,690
He almost got over it.

238
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:34,097
That's the basement.
We had to seal it up.

239
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,096
We got some black
mold down there.

240
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:40,198
My mother loved her kitchen, so
we keep a piece of her in here.

241
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,937
Georgina, this is Chris.
This is Roses boyfriend.

242
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:45,998
Hi.

243
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,140
Hello.

244
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,709
The garbage goes
under the sink,

245
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,342
<i>and new {or me
piéce de résistance,</i>

246
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,855
the field of play.

247
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:05,685
I love it.

248
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,730
The nearest house
is across the lake.

249
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,365
It's total privacy.

250
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,044
I know what
you're thinking.

251
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,201
What?

252
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,541
Come on, I get it.

253
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,143
White family,
black servants.

254
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,311
It's a total cliche.

255
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,545
I wasn't gonna
take it there.

256
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,383
Well, you didn't have to.
Believe me'

257
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:34,886
No.

258
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:39,492
We hired Georgina and Walter
to help care for my parents.

259
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,487
When they died,

260
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,499
I couldn't bear to
let them go. I mean...

261
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,766
But, boy, I hate
the way it looks.

262
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,368
Yeah' I know
what you mean.

263
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:59,277
By the way, I would have voted for
Obama for a third term if I could.

264
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,714
Best president in my lifetime.
Hands down.

265
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,251
I agree.
Yeah.

266
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,586
So what do your
parents do, Chris?

267
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,589
Uh...

268
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,429
My dad wasn't
really in the picture.

269
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,365
My mom passed
away when I was 11.

270
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,527
Oh, I'm sorry.
How did she die?

271
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:22,900
A hit and run.

272
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,234
That's awful.

273
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,433
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.
You were young.

274
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:30,241
Actually, I don't remember a
lot from that time, so...

275
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,244
Well, that's okay. We don't
have to talk about that.

276
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,788
You smoke, Chris?

277
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,782
Mmm-hmm.

278
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,418
You jonesing
a little bit over there, huh'?

279
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,584
I'm quitting.

280
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,459
Dad, this is why I don't bring
people to the house anymore.

281
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:51,124
That's okay. We're not judging.
We're not.

282
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,792
That's a nasty habit,
though.

283
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:56,801
You should have Missy take
care of that for you.

284
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,764
How?

285
00:19:58,931 --> 00:19:59,932
Hypnosis.

286
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,012
She developed a method, and I'm
telling you, it works like a charm.

287
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,638
Wow, um...

288
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,173
Some people
don't want strangers

289
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,410
messing around in
their heads, guys.

290
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,987
Listen, Chris, I thought
it was total bullshit.

291
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,454
I smoked cigarettes
for 15 years.

292
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,856
I loved every
goddamn puff I took.

293
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,257
She puts me under once...

294
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,657
The sight of a cigarette
makes me want to vomit.

295
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,824
Okay, fall back, Dean.

296
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,095
It's a service we provide.

297
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,265
I'm good, actually.

298
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,364
Yes.
Thank you, though.

299
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,443
Well, smoker or not, we're
thrilled to have you up here

300
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,172
for the big get-together.
Yeah.

301
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,177
Wait, holy shit.
That's this weekend?

302
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,337
Yes, this weekend.

303
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,006
What get-together?
Oh, my God.

304
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,480
Thanks, George.

305
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,854
It's Rose's grandfather's party.

306
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,292
My dad would throw
a shindig once a year.

307
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,154
Get all his friends together,

308
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,353
bocce ball, badminton...

309
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,623
Wait, why didn't you
guys tell me about this?

310
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:57,056
Well, it's the same day
every year, sweetheart.

311
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,859
No, it's not.
Um...

312
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,465
It is.
Actually, it is.

313
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:01,504
Is it really?

314
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,903
Yeah, that's where you'd be wrong.
Yeah.

315
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,533
We just kept it up because after
they died, it felt like...

316
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,040
We keep them close to us.

317
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,544
Yeah, they're still with us.

318
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,979
I just wanted to
have a chill weekend.

319
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,716
Sounds like fun, actually.

320
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,376
Oh, Georgina.

321
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,314
I'm so sorry.

322
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,481
That's okay.

323
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,355
Why don't you go lay down?
Just get some rest.

324
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,158
Yes, I think I will.

325
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,035
Good.

326
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,069
My God, it must be very...

327
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,539
'Sup, fam!

328
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,405
Hey, Jar-Bear.

329
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,206
Hi, darling.
Hey, buddy.

330
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,908
Nobody answers
the door around here?

331
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,012
Hey, Rosie.

332
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,543
<i>Why would I lie, huh?</i>

333
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,710
I love it!

334
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,889
Did she tell you about
her toenail collection?

335
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,551
What?
Oh, my God!

336
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:01,897
She used to bite 'em off, suck on
'em, and save 'em in a jewelry box.

337
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,959
No, I didn't. I don't know
what you're talking about.

338
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,229
That is so disgusting.

339
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,461
I fucking hate you.

340
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,198
Okay, here's a good one.

341
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,573
Uh, let me set the scene.
It was our junior year.

342
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,406
Rose has a crush on this guy,
Conner Garfield.

343
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:17,569
Conner Garfield.

344
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,774
No. Mom?

345
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,111
No, Jeremy, stop.

346
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,049
No, no, these are good.

347
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,243
I want to hear them.

348
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,151
Yeah, Rose,
where are your manners?

349
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,383
Our guest wants to
hear the stories, please.

350
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,425
Thank you.

351
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,257
So Conner's from my lacrosse team, right?
Huge kid, like 6'3".

352
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,921
And he's pretty dumb, right?
So we threw this party.

353
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,125
You threw a party.

354
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,603
I think my parents
were in Greece or something.

355
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,102
We raided their liquor cabinet
and we're all shit-faced.

356
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,262
Like 15 of us.

357
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,602
Oh, my God. Tell me
this isn't true, Rose.

358
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,466
Yeah.

359
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,011
I filled the liquor
bottles with water...

360
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,673
And let me finish?

361
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,316
Uh-huh. Go ahead.
I'm curious.

362
00:22:55,407 --> 00:23:01,255
So I'm upstairs hooking up with the
hottest girl in class, Jean Deely.

363
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,314
Oh, God.

364
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:03,984
You realize you're
coming off as, like,

365
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,652
the world's
biggest douchebag, right?

366
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:11,364
So Conner starts banging
on the bathroom door, right'?

367
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,001
I open it

368
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,968
and blood's gushing from his mouth.
And he's screaming,

369
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,608
"Your sister
bit my fucking tongue off!"

370
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,368
You bit him?
What?

371
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,274
Okay, to be fair,
it was my first kiss

372
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,177
and he slipped some tongue
and I was not expecting it.

373
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,012
It was a reflex. I'm sorry.

374
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,384
A reflex that I have
since gotten rid of.

375
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,851
Yeah.
Yeah, you better be careful.

376
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,458
Yeah, I'm very careful now.

377
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:41,522
I'm gonna go get dessert. And, Dean,
maybe clean it up just a little bit?

378
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:50,640
So, Chris, what's your sport?
Football? Baseball?

379
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,907
Basketball, mostly, I guess.

380
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,339
You an MMA fan?

381
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,004
Dude.

382
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,169
"Dude" what?

383
00:23:58,704 --> 00:23:59,705
What?

384
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:03,251
Hey, Jeremy, why don't we let someone
else have the floor for a second?

385
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,550
You're dating
my sister, right?

386
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,926
He's dating my sister.
You had your chance.

387
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,491
I can't get to know
the guy?

388
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,762
You mean like UFO?

389
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,494
Yes.

390
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,234
Nah, too brutal for me.

391
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,334
You ever get into
street fights as a kid?

392
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:32,708
I did judo after school,
first grade.

393
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,073
Aw...
You should've seen me.

394
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,377
Judo?

395
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:40,917
'Cause with your frame
and your genetic makeup,

396
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,757
if you really
pushed your body,

397
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,563
and I mean really train,
you know?

398
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:50,431
No pussyfooting around.
You'd be a fucking beast.

399
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,893
Carrot cake!

400
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,438
Ooh!

401
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,062
Carrot cake.

402
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,631
What did I miss?

403
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,437
A whole bunch of nothing.

404
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:06,579
Just talking about sports.
Right?

405
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:07,639
Yeah.

406
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,108
That sounds good.

407
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:12,482
So the thing
about jiu-jitsu is

408
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,724
strength doesn't matter, right?
It's all about this.

409
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:23,122
It's a strategic game
like chess.

410
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:27,634
It's all about being two,
three, four moves ahead.

411
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:32,598
Cool.

412
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:39,580
Stand up.

413
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,981
Jeremy, no karate
at the dinner table.

414
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,279
It's not karate, Ma.

415
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,683
Yo, I got a rule. No
play-fighting with drunk dudes.

416
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,778
I don't play,
I'm just...

417
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,288
Jeremy.

418
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,199
I wasn't gonna hurt him.

419
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:12,144
He was gonna put you
in a fucking headlock.

420
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:13,877
What is his problem?

421
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,144
He has never treated
any of my boyfriends that way.

422
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,514
Ever, ever, ever.

423
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,610
Mmm-hmm.

424
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:22,189
Oh, my God. And then my dad
with the "my man" stuff.

425
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,820
"My man, my man."

426
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:27,293
I don't think he's ever heard that
or said it. And now he just...

427
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,522
It's all he says.

428
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:29,689
Yup.

429
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,835
Oh, and my mom being
rude to Georgina?

430
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,200
What the fuck was that about?
That was so crazy.

431
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,004
I mean...

432
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,408
How are they different
than that cop?

433
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,010
That's the fucking
bummer of it all.

434
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:48,407
Mmm-hmm.

435
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,375
<i>Mmm-hmm?</i>

436
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,485
Anything more
you'd like to add?

437
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,225
I told you so, like...

438
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,898
I didn't want to say it.

439
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,037
I didn't want to say it.
I didn't want to say that.

440
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,199
I don't like being wrong.

441
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,362
I've noticed that

442
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:11,430
But I am sorry.

443
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:14,203
No, no, no.
Wait. Come here. Come here.

444
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,004
I'm sorry.
This sucks.

445
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,613
What? Why you saying "sorry"?

446
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,180
'Cause I brought you here and
I'm related to all of them.

447
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,876
No, it's fine.
It's fine.

448
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,878
Yeah?
Yeah?

449
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,956
Uh-huh.
How are you so calm?

450
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,092
Honestly, it's nothing.

451
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:32,122
I like you on your
racial flow, though.

452
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,088
Is this a racial flow?
Racial flow.

453
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,289
Am I feeling
a racial flow?

454
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,128
Yeah, you're
feeling racially flowy.

455
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,144
Oh, fuck. The party.

456
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,244
How bad can it be?

457
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,911
They are so white.
Like, so white!

458
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,112
It's all good.

459
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,383
Yeah?
Yeah.

460
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,391
You know,
with my genetic makeup,

461
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,427
shit gonna go down.

462
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,327
I'm a beast.
I'm a beast!

463
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,802
Do you realize how
dangerous smoking is?

464
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,001
Yeah.

465
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,170
Come in and sit with me.

466
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,403
Please?

467
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,650
Just for a little while.
Please.

468
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:16,975
Thank you.

469
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,352
So you're
comfortable enough, right?

470
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:26,791
It's perfect. Thanks.

471
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,153
Sure.

472
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,003
You wanna know
how it works?

473
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:47,474
You just dangle a pocket watch in
front of people's faces? Is that it?

474
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,620
You watch a lot of TV.

475
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,653
Uh...
When I was a kid.

476
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,158
Now you're
feeling very sleepy.

477
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,388
We do use focal
points sometimes

478
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,695
to guide someone into a state
of heightened suggestibility.

479
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,494
"Heightened suggestibility."

480
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,535
That's right.
That's right.

481
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,735
Do you smoke in front
of my daughter?

482
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,410
I'm gonna quit.
I promise.

483
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,642
That's my kid.
That is my kid.

484
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:22,807
You understand?

485
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:29,385
What about your mother?

486
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,855
What about her?
Wait, are we...

487
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,061
Where were you when she died?

488
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,071
I don't want to
think about that.

489
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,418
Home. Watching TV.

490
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:01,524
Do you hear the TV?
What do you hear?

491
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,214
Rain.

492
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,883
Rain. It was raining.

493
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,085
Hmm.

494
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,254
You hear the rain?

495
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:15,260
Mmm-hmm...

496
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,267
You hear it? Find it.

497
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,406
Tell me when you've found it.

498
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,786
Come here, Chris.
Look at me.

499
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,251
I found it.

500
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,287
Where was your mom?

501
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,968
She was coming home
and she wasn't home.

502
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:57,636
From work?

503
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:58,770
Hmm.

504
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,438
Hmm.

505
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,785
And what do you do?

506
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:12,984
Nothing.

507
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:15,487
Nothing.

508
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:18,824
I just sat there.

509
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,300
You didn't call anyone?
No.

510
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,360
Why not?

511
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,973
I don't know.

512
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,942
I just thought that if I did,
it would make it real.

513
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,539
Hmm.

514
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,520
You're so scared.

515
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,853
You think it was your fault.

516
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,692
How do you feel now?

517
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,200
I can't move.

518
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:00,841
You can't move.

519
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,205
Why can't I move?

520
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,411
You're paralyzed.

521
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,982
Just like that day
when you did nothing.

522
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,378
You did nothing.

523
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,145
Now,

524
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:17,152
sink into the floor.

525
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,217
Wait, wait, wait.
Sink.

526
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,637
Now you're in
the Sunken Place.

527
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,735
'Sup, man?

528
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,466
They're workin' you
good out here, huh?

529
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,105
Nothing I don't want
to be doing.

530
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:05,280
Yeah.

531
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:11,488
I didn't get to meet you,
actually, up close. I'm Chris.

532
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,327
I know who you are.

533
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,155
She is lovely, isn't she?

534
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,090
Rose?

535
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:22,600
Yeah, she is.

536
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,638
One of a kind.
Top of the line.

537
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,271
A real doggone keeper.

538
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,813
Right.

539
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,278
Sorry about last night.

540
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:39,344
What?

541
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,248
My exercise.

542
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,314
I didn't mean to scare you.

543
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,191
Yeah. Yeah.

544
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,189
And did it work?
Did what work?

545
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:53,633
You were in Mrs. Armitage's
office for quite some time.

546
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:56,999
Oh, yeah.

547
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,164
Hmm?

548
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,609
I guess I had too much
of that wine last night.

549
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,271
Can't really remember. Sorry.

550
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:10,716
Well, I should get back to
work and mind my own business.

551
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,672
I think your mom hypnotized
me last night.

552
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,405
What?

553
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:38,336
When?

554
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:42,549
I went out for some air last
night, and I run into her.

555
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,051
And I can barely
remember anything,

556
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,349
but now the thought of a cigarette
makes me wanna throw up.

557
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:51,416
Oh, my God.

558
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,528
I'm sorry. I can't believe
she did that to you.

559
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,589
And I had some
fucked-up dreams.

560
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,064
What's! you dream?

561
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,899
I was in a hole or something. And
I couldn't move. It was like...

562
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:06,008
oh, God. That sounds terrible.

563
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:07,234
I'm sorry.

564
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:12,075
Hey, uh, what's Walter's deal?

565
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,247
What do you mean "his deal"?

566
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,018
I just talked to him.
Dude's whole vibe is hostile.

567
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,418
Did he say something?

568
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,288
It's not what he says.
It's how he says it, you know?

569
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:25,883
Hmm.

570
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,423
Maybe he likes you.

571
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,128
Maybe he's jealous
or something. I don't...

572
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,037
Are you fucking with me?

573
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:38,096
No.

574
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,578
So you think I've got
a chance with him?

575
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:46,541
All right, you got jokes.
Putin a good word?

576
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,115
Great. No, funny.

577
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,616
I'm gonna talk to my dad about that.
That's not...

578
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:52,277
No, don't talk to your dad.
It's not cool.

579
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,252
It's fine, it's not a big
deal- It's not a big deal.

580
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:56,449
Forget about it. It's done.

581
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:57,982
Okay.

582
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,119
Oh, boy.

583
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,304
Oh, man.

584
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:12,601
It begins.

585
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,436
Are you ready for this?

586
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,805
Yeah, I am.

587
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:16,934
I'm not.

588
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,915
There they are.
Oh!

589
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,075
So nice.
How are you?

590
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,482
Just smile.
Smile? All right.

591
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:27,679
How do you do that again?

592
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,519
Yeah, just smile
the whole time.

593
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,420
Yeah, there you go.
There it is.

594
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:35,655
Oh, look,
it's the Greenes.

595
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,128
Gordon and Emily,
this is Chris.

596
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,826
Chris, this is Gordon
and Emily Greene.

597
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,094
Chris. Nice to meet you.

598
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,502
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Nice to meet you indeed.

599
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,695
Oh, that's quite a grip.

600
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:44,829
Thank you. You too, man.

601
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,532
You, uh, ever play golf?

602
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:49,141
Mmm, once, a few years ago.
I wasn't very good.

603
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:52,638
Gordon was a professional
golfer for years.

604
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:54,176
Oh, you kiddin'?

605
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:57,185
Well, I can't quite swing the
hips like I used to, though.

606
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,321
But, uh, I do know Tiger.

607
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:00,378
Oh.

608
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,158
Oh, that's great.
Super.

609
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,955
Gordon loves Tiger.

610
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,459
Oh, the best I've ever seen.

611
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,324
Ever. Hands down.

612
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:10,989
So, Chris, uh,
let's see your form.

613
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,328
This is Nelson and Lisa.

614
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:15,698
Hey, how you doin'?

615
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,568
So, how handsome is he?

616
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,340
I don't know, are you handsome?

617
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:24,835
Okay.

618
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:28,707
Oh!
Not bad. Eh, Nelson?

619
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,882
So, is it true?

620
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:37,215
Is it better?

621
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:38,316
Oh, wow.

622
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:39,684
Wow.

623
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:44,064
Fairer skin has been in favor for the
past, what, couple of hundreds of years'?

624
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,828
But now the pendulum
has swung back.

625
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,167
Black is in fashion.

626
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,537
Pardon me, I'm gonna
take some pictures.

627
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,906
Sure thing.

628
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,367
There he is.
Oh!

629
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,138
Good to see another
brother around here.

630
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:10,142
Hi. Yes, of course it is.

631
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:13,978
Something wrong?

632
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,118
There you are.

633
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,417
Do something with this.

634
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,584
Ah, yes, yes.

635
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:24,189
Oh, hello. I'm Philomena.
And you are?

636
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,658
Chris. Rose's boyfriend.

637
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,168
Fantastic.

638
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,830
You two make a lovely couple.

639
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:33,832
Thanks.

640
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:35,443
Oh, where are my manners?

641
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,840
Logan. Logan King.

642
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:40,138
Chris was just telling me
how he felt

643
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,184
much more comfortable
with my being here.

644
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:44,342
That's nice.

645
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:49,856
Logan, I hate to tear you
away, dear, but

646
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,688
the Wincotts were
asking about you.

647
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,192
Ah, mmm.

648
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,731
Well, it was nice to
meet you, Chris.

649
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,339
Goodbye.

650
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:22,081
What the fuck?

651
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:41,168
Ignorance.

652
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,045
Who?

653
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,580
All of 'em.

654
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:49,048
They mean well but they have no
idea what real people go through.

655
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,784
Jim Hudson.
Chris.

656
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:54,946
I know who you are.

657
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,889
I am an admirer of your work.
You have a great eye.

658
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,896
Wait, Jim Hudson?
Hudson Galleries?

659
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:08,928
Believe me, the irony of being a
blind art dealer isn't lost on me.

660
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:11,937
How'd you do it?

661
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:16,774
My assistant describes the
work to me in great detail.

662
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,111
You've got something.

663
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:23,377
The images you capture.
So brutal, so melancholic.

664
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,748
It's powerful stuff, I think.

665
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:28,919
Thank you.
Hmm.

666
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:33,393
Used to dabble myself,
wilderness mostly.

667
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:39,494
<i>I submitted to Nat Geo 14 times before
realizing I didn't have the eye.</i>

668
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:43,296
I began dealing. Then, of
course, my vision went to shit.

669
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:44,628
Damn.

670
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,803
I know. Life can be
a sick joke.

671
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,944
One day, you're developing
prints in the darkroom.

672
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,639
The next day,
you wake up in the dark.

673
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:57,444
Genetic disease.

674
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,285
Shit ain't fair, man.

675
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,083
Oh, you got that right.
Shit ain't fair.

676
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:00,504
Hey.

677
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:02,878
Come here, come here.

678
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,882
What the fuck?
You left me out there.

679
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:08,887
Look at this.

680
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:12,653
She unplugged my phone.

681
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,751
Who?

682
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:16,855
Georgina. I came here to talk
to Rod, and I got no juice.

683
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:19,058
So you think she
did that because...

684
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,993
Maybe she doesn't like

685
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,703
the fact that I'm with you.

686
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,406
Really?

687
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:32,403
It's a thing.

688
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:36,451
So you are so sexy that people
are just unpluggin' your phone?

689
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:39,843
Forget it. Never mind.

690
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,912
No, no, no. Stop, don't...

691
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,753
Don't do that.
Don't...

692
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,361
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's all good, all right?

693
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:03,207
They got you on
display now, huh?

694
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,643
<i>It's weird, man.
And it's the people here, too.</i>

695
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,114
It's like they haven't met a black
person that doesn't work for 'em.

696
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:09,783
Yep, you're in it.

697
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,248
<i>Also, shit...</i>

698
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,277
I don't even wanna tell you.

699
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:14,445
<i>What?</i>

700
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,619
I got hypnotized last night.

701
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,450
Nigga, get the fuck
outta here.

702
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:21,960
No. Yo, yo.
Yeah, to quit smoking.

703
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,463
But it's Rose's mom's
a psychiatrist, so...

704
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:27,296
Bruh, I don't care if the bitch
is lyanla Vanzant, okay?

705
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:30,234
She can't fix my motherfuckin' life.
You ain't gettin' in my head.

706
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,301
I know. She caught me
off guard, right?

707
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:37,344
But it's cool because
I'm cured. It worked.

708
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,674
Bruh, how are you
not scared of this, man?

709
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:41,817
Look, they could've made you
do all types of stupid shit.

710
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,282
They'd have you fuckin'
barking like a dog,

711
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:46,315
<i>flying around
like you're a fuckin' pigeon,</i>

712
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:47,478
lookin' ridiculous, okay?

713
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,955
Or, I don't know
if you know this,

714
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:51,821
white people love makin'
people sex slaves and shit.

715
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,694
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're
not a kinky sex family, dawg.

716
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:59,357
Look, Jeffrey Dahmer was eating the
shit outta niggas' heads. Okay?

717
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,434
But that was after
he fucked the heads.

718
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:03,199
Do you think they
saw that shit comin'?

719
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,532
Hell no.

720
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:06,470
<i>Okay? They was cumin'
over there like,</i>

721
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,338
"I'mma just suck a little dick,
maybe jiggle some balls and shit."

722
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,343
No. They didn't get
a chance to jiggle shit

723
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:13,175
because their head
was off their fuckin' body.

724
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:15,283
Yeah, they still sucked a dick,
but without their heads.

725
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:17,148
It was fuckin' weird,
detached head shit.

726
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:18,481
You know, that's
Jeffrey Dahmer's business.

727
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:21,646
And thanks for that
image right there, man.

728
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,122
Hey, man, l ain't makin' this shit up.
I saw on A&E, man.

729
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,159
<i>It's real life.</i>

730
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:26,455
Yo, and it's the black people
out here, too.

731
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:28,394
It's like all of them
missed the movement.

732
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:30,395
<i>'Cause they
probably hypnotized.</i>

733
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,234
Look, bruh, all I'm doin'
is connecting the dots.

734
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,531
I'm taking what you
presented to me, okay?

735
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:39,641
I'mma tell you this.
I think that mom

736
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:40,835
is puttin' everybody
in a trance,

737
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:42,341
and she's fuckin'
the shit out of 'em.

738
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:43,739
Thanks, Rod, bye.

739
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,709
Hello.
Fuck. Hi.

740
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:53,052
I owe you an apology.

741
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,688
How rude of me to have touched
your belongings without asking.

742
00:51:57,748 --> 00:51:58,852
Oh...

743
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:01,396
No, it's cool.
I was just confused.

744
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:06,023
Well, I can assure you,
there was no funny business.

745
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,729
Allow me to explain.

746
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:13,034
I lifted your cellular phone
to wipe down the dresser,

747
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,908
and it accidentally
came undone.

748
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,376
Yeah, I told... Rather than
meddle with it further,

749
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:20,442
I left it that way.

750
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,111
How foolish of me.

751
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:28,412
It's fine.
I wasn't trying to snitch.

752
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:31,115
Snitch?

753
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:33,255
Rat you out.

754
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:36,894
Tattletale.

755
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:39,223
Yeah.

756
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:42,593
Oh, don't you
worry about that.

757
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:45,467
I can assure you,

758
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,108
I don't answer to anyone.

759
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:51,103
Right.

760
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:53,646
All I know is sometimes

761
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:57,251
if there's too many white people,
I get nervous, you know?

762
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,574
Oh. Oh!

763
00:53:25,636 --> 00:53:29,311
No. No. No.

764
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:33,511
No, no, no, no.

765
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:36,454
Aren't you something?

766
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:39,286
That's not my experience.

767
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:41,353
Not at all.

768
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:47,435
The Armitages are
so good to us.

769
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,169
They treat us like family.

770
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,023
This bitch is crazy.

771
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,193
The bitch is crazy.

772
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,532
Oh, hey, hang on. Chris.

773
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:22,867
Chris, I wanna introduce you
to some friends.

774
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,469
This is David
and Marcia Wincott,

775
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:27,304
Ronald and Celia Jeffries,

776
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,570
Hiroki Tanaka,

777
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,702
and Jessika and
Fredrich Walden.

778
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:35,875
Too many names to remember, but hi.

779
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:39,580
Do you find that
being African-American

780
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:45,387
has more advantage or
disadvantage in the modern world?

781
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:46,683
Whoa!

782
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,063
It's a tough one.

783
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:55,062
Yeah, um, I don't know, man.

784
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:57,831
Hey.

785
00:54:58,395 --> 00:54:59,999
Yo, my man.

786
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:02,074
They were askin' me about the
African-American experience.

787
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,575
Maybe you could take this one.

788
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:05,535
Oh.

789
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:10,078
Well, well, I find that the
African-American experience

790
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,585
for me has been, for the
most part, very good.

791
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:16,748
Although I find it difficult
to go into detail

792
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:21,021
as I haven't had much of a desire
to leave the house in a while.

793
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,096
We've become such homebodies.

794
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:24,789
Yes, yes.

795
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:28,131
But even when you go into the
city, I've just had no interest.

796
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,863
The chores have become
my sanctuary.

797
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,778
Fucking shit.

798
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:48,145
Get out.

799
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,786
Sorry, man.
Logan.

800
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:53,657
Get out!
Yo!

801
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,158
Yo, chill, man.
Get out!

802
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,300
Get outta here! Get outta here!
Chill! Chill, man! Chill!

803
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,059
Get the fuck outta here!
Chill!

804
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:11,604
Seizures create anxiety
which can trigger aggression.

805
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:14,271
Yeah, but randomly
attacking other people?

806
00:56:14,438 --> 00:56:15,849
It's not random.

807
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:19,180
You know, it was your flash.
That's what set him off.

808
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,480
Hey.
Well...

809
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,750
How's he doing?
He's much better.

810
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,030
I imagine that I owe
you all an apology.

811
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:32,531
No, no, no.

812
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:35,329
We're just very happy
that you're yourself again.

813
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,028
Yes. Yes, lam.
Hmm.

814
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,971
And I thank God
for you for calming me clown.

815
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:44,676
I know that I must've
frightened you all quite a bit.

816
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,442
Especially you, Chris.

817
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,277
No. I'm sorry.

818
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:51,345
The flash. I didn't know.

819
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:54,348
Of course not.
How could you have?

820
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,684
And you shouldn't
have been drinking, either.

821
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:58,287
Yes.

822
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,161
Well, I'll have to
let you all gel on

823
00:57:01,218 --> 00:57:03,528
the rest of the night without
the aid of my marvelous wit.

824
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:08,198
The whole ordeal has made me
quite a bit exhausted.

825
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,531
Logan' you just
get some rest.

826
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,532
It was nice
meeting you, Chris.

827
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,870
Yeah.

828
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:21,644
Something to lighten the mood?

829
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:25,048
Yes! Yeah, let's get this
party back on track.

830
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,052
How about sparklers
and Bingo?

831
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,719
We're gonna go on a walk.

832
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,388
You sure?

833
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:38,355
Shall we?

834
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:41,363
My cousin's epileptic.

835
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:42,995
That wasn't a seizure, right?

836
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:46,398
My dad's a neurosurgeon.

837
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,565
And that's what he said it was.
I'm inclined to trust...

838
00:57:48,732 --> 00:57:50,905
That wasn't a seizure.
What was it then?

839
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:52,411
How long have you
known that guy'?

840
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,244
I met him today. Why?

841
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:01,122
Man, this is gonna
sound weird,

842
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,690
but when he came at me,

843
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,455
it felt like I knew him.

844
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:12,089
Like you've met Logan before?

845
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:13,928
No, I don't know Logan. I
knew the guy that come at me.

846
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:28,279
I think your mom got in my head, all
right'? I think she got in my head.

847
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:30,042
Yeah, and it worked,
I thought...

848
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:33,213
No, it did not.
It didn't work.

849
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,380
She got in my head,

850
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,118
and now I'm thinking all this fucked-up
shit that I don't want to think about.

851
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:40,787
Like what?

852
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:55,469
I just need to go.

853
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,983
You wanna go?
Mmm-hmm.

854
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,448
Without me?

855
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:10,814
Whatever you want.

856
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:26,830
I told you about that
night my mom died.

857
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:30,062
When I didn't call 911,
didn't go out looking for her.

858
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:32,662
Yeah.

859
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:37,739
One hour went by,
then two, then three,

860
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:41,511
and I just sat there.

861
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,746
I was just watching TV.

862
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,579
There's nothing
you could've done.

863
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:52,352
I found out later
that, uh,

864
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,759
she had survived
the initial hit.

865
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:03,067
She laid there bleeding
by the side of the road,

866
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:05,103
cold and alone.

867
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:11,440
That's how she died in the
early morning, cold and alone.

868
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:15,277
And I was watching TV.

869
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:21,555
There was time. There was time.
You were just a little kid.

870
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:23,956
There was time.

871
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:27,050
There was time, if somebody
was looking for her.

872
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:30,289
There was time, but nobody,
nobody was looking.

873
01:01:40,597 --> 01:01:42,270
You're all I got.

874
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:45,811
I'm not gonna leave here without you.
I'm not gonna abandon you, okay?

875
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,241
You're not?

876
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:51,113
No, no, I'm not.

877
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:03,822
Oh, my God.

878
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,461
You scared me.

879
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:12,102
Let's go home.

880
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,639
What?

881
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:17,711
Let's go home. This sucks.

882
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:20,938
This sucks. Let's go home.

883
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:22,540
I'll make something up.

884
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,381
I love you.

885
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:29,018
I love you too, baby.

886
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:47,731
Good night.
Thank you.

887
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:49,205
Come on, sweetie.

888
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:53,637
Good night, Chris!
It was great to meet you.

889
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:00,475
Asshole.

890
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:05,275
Yo!

891
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:06,716
That's Dre.

892
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:07,911
<i>Dre?</i>

893
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,719
Andre Hayworth. He used
to kick it with Veronica.

894
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,781
Veronica from what?

895
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:14,394
Teresa's sister, that worked at
the movie theater on Eighth!

896
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:18,331
Yes, that is him!
That is him! But wait...

897
01:04:18,488 --> 01:04:21,298
This is so fucking crazy!

898
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:23,301
Yo, he's different.

899
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,804
No shit. Why's he
dressed like that?

900
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,805
It's not that,
it's everything.

901
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:30,604
He came to the party with a while
woman 30 years older than him.

902
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:33,976
Sex slave! oh, shit!

903
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:35,775
<i>Chris, you gotta get the
fuck up outta there, man!</i>

904
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:38,749
<i>You in some Eyes Wide Shut situation.
Leave, motherfucker.</i>

905
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:39,976
Hello?

906
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:42,588
You gonna be a...
Hello? Chris?

907
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:45,453
Oh, shit. His battery
must've fuckin' died.

908
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,124
Hey, handsome.
Are you packing?

909
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:50,355
Rose, we gotta go.

910
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,760
We gotta go now.

911
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:53,963
Okay.
Okay.

912
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:55,261
Is everything okay?

913
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:57,601
I'll tell you in the car.
But we gotta go right now.

914
01:04:57,694 --> 01:04:59,264
Is that okay?
Okay, yeah.

915
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:01,673
Uh, let me go get my bag. Okay.

916
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:03,299
Okay.

917
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:08,037
Shit.

918
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:42,434
Hey, you ready?

919
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:46,209
Yeah, I'm just looking
for my camera.

920
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:47,270
Uh...

921
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:50,540
It's right here.

922
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:52,983
Have you got the keys'? I'm gonna put
the bags in the trunk real quick.

923
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:54,143
Okay.

924
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,291
Uh, yeah.
They are in here somewhere.

925
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,256
It's just a matter of
finding them.

926
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,316
You okay?

927
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:02,060
Yeah. Yeah.

928
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:03,222
Okay.

929
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:05,956
Might take me a second.

930
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,330
Hey, uh...

931
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:10,737
What, you can't
find those keys?

932
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:12,167
No. I can never find
them.

933
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:13,466
Let's do this on the move.

934
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:14,897
Yeah.

935
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,516
Chris?
Just get the keys.

936
01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:24,413
Yo.
Yo, man.

937
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:25,976
Where you going? The party
was just getting started.

938
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:28,249
Just putting the bags
in the car, man.

939
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:29,981
Would anyone like tea?

940
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,523
Nah, I'm good.
We leavin', actually.

941
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:33,991
Really? Why?
ls something wrong?

942
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:36,762
Rose?
His dog got really sick.

943
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:39,331
So he has to be at the vet
first thing in the morning.

944
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:40,990
Sick.
Yeah.

945
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:42,602
Oh, how terrible.

946
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:45,836
Rose, the keys.
Looking.

947
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:51,534
Rose?

948
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:03,187
What is your
purpose, Chris?

949
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:05,815
What?

950
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:11,194
In life, what is your purpose?

951
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:13,389
Right now,

952
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:15,864
it's finding those keys.

953
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:19,367
Fire.

954
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:22,370
It's a reflection
of our own mortality.

955
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:25,479
We're born, we breathe,
and we die.

956
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:26,536
Rose?

957
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:29,372
I'm looking.

958
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:33,554
Even the sun will die someday.

959
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,048
But we are divine.

960
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,884
We are the gods
trapped in cocoons.

961
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,427
Rose...

962
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:44,829
I don't know where they are.

963
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:45,988
Rose?

964
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,899
Rose!
Rose, give me those keys!

965
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:51,235
Rose, give me...

966
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,240
Give me those keys.
Rose, now! Now, the keys!

967
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:57,404
Be careful, bro.

968
01:08:57,567 --> 01:08:58,739
What the fuck?

969
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:00,914
I didn't do anything.

970
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,516
What the fuck
is going on?

971
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,749
Where are those keys, Rose?

972
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:18,864
You know I can't give you
the keys, right, babe?

973
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:37,641
Come on.

974
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:48,956
Oh, shit.

975
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:51,621
Is he hurt?
Did you see him drop?

976
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:54,291
Yes, I did.
Jeremy, grab his legs, please.

977
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:56,164
Take him downstairs.
Dean, help him.

978
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,633
I can get him alone.

979
01:09:57,794 --> 01:09:58,966
No, you can't.

980
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:00,129
You've already
damaged him enough.

981
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:01,639
Okay, fine.

982
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:03,900
Okay.

983
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:08,411
Ready?
Mind his head. Please.

984
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,652
Easy.

985
01:10:18,815 --> 01:10:19,816
You're gonna drop him.

986
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,086
No, I'm not.

987
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:22,929
You're not gonna give me
a little credit?

988
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:24,994
Okay, that was my fault.

989
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,766
You were
one of my favorites.

990
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:34,764
You hear that, Chris?
Huh?

991
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,538
You're one of her favorites. Chris?

992
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:02,669
Hey, it's Chris.

993
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:06,036
<i>Fm either away from the phone or I
just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.</i>

994
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:14,337
Chris!

995
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,025
Hey, it's Chris.

996
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:29,222
<i>Pm either away from the phone or I
 just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.</i>

997
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:35,061
Yeah.

998
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,059
Me too.

999
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:38,398
...College Fund.

1000
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:41,236
<i>A mind is a terrible
thing to waste.</i>

1001
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:44,742
<i>Millions of Americans fee!
the effects of aging.</i>

1002
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:22,939
Oh, shit.

1003
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:13,331
Oh, shit!

1004
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:46,858
<i>Is there anything
more beautiful than a sunrise?</i>

1005
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:52,870
<i>Hi. I'm Roman Armitage.</i>

1006
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:57,205
<i>And if you're watching this, you're
probably wondering what's going on.</i>

1007
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:59,513
<i>There's no need to worry.</i>

1008
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,204
<i>Let's take a walk.</i>

1009
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:07,843
<i>You have been chosen because
of the physical advantages</i>

1010
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:10,513
<i>you've enjoyed
your entire lifetime.</i>

1011
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:14,024
<i>With your natural gifts
and our determination,</i>

1012
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:16,925
<i>we could both be
part of something greater.</i>

1013
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:19,032
<i>Something perfect.</i>

1014
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:27,937
<i>The Coagula procedure
is a man-made miracle.</i>

1015
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:33,070
<i>Our order has been developing
it for many, many years,</i>

1016
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:36,444
<i>and I! wasn't until
recently it was perfected</i>

1017
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:41,420
<i>by my own flesh and blood.</i>

1018
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:48,923
<i>My family and I are honored to offer it
as a service to members of our group.</i>

1019
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:51,588
<i>Don 'I waste your strength,
don't try to fight it.</i>

1020
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:55,759
<i>You can'! stop the inevitable.
And who knows?</i>

1021
01:14:56,725 --> 01:15:02,573
<i>Maybe one day, you?! enjoy
being members of the family.</i>

1022
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,439
<i>Behold,</i>

1023
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,648
<i>the Coagula.</i>

1024
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:25,288
What the fuck?

1025
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:42,073
Hello, Mr...

1026
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:44,614
Uh, Williams. Rod Williams.

1027
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:46,077
From the TSA?

1028
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:47,314
Yes, ma'am.

1029
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:52,451
You know all TSA issues should be brought
up with your authorizing officer.

1030
01:15:52,515 --> 01:15:54,620
Yes, ma'am, but this
is not TSA business.

1031
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:58,153
Okay, don't call me "ma'am."
Otherwise we're not gonna get along.

1032
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:02,259
How can I help you,
Rod Williams from the TSA?

1033
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:03,928
All right, here it is.
Mmm.

1034
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:08,499
My boy, Chris, has been
missing for two days.

1035
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:10,435
Your son is missing?

1036
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:14,276
Oh, no. Not my son,
my friend. He's 26.

1037
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:16,338
His name is Chris Washington.

1038
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:23,153
He left on Friday with
his girlfriend, Rose Armitage.

1039
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:26,182
She's white.

1040
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:30,053
All right. Go on.

1041
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:32,358
Look, Chris was supposed
to come back on Sunday, right?

1042
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:35,024
And I've been watching his dog, Sid.

1043
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:37,159
That's Sid.

1044
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:38,569
Cute, right?

1045
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:42,706
So Chris sent this to me from his
girlfriend's parents' house.

1046
01:16:43,032 --> 01:16:44,739
See, that's Andre Hayworth.

1047
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,880
Okay? Somebody we knew
from back in the day.

1048
01:16:47,036 --> 01:16:50,415
Apparently, he's been missing for
six months in some affluent suburb.

1049
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:53,475
Well, he don't look
so missing to me.

1050
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,647
That's 'cause we
found him, right?

1051
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:57,213
But Chris said
he's acting real different.

1052
01:16:57,746 --> 01:16:58,850
Different how?

1053
01:16:58,914 --> 01:16:59,915
This dude is from Brooklyn.

1054
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:02,189
Huh? He didn't dress
like this.

1055
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:04,224
I didn't use to
dress like this.

1056
01:17:04,587 --> 01:17:06,863
Plus he's married to a
white woman twice his age.

1057
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:09,260
And that would explain
the clothes. All right.

1058
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:14,203
Oh, Lord! Rod Williams
from the TSA.

1059
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:15,264
I know, I know, I know.

1060
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,241
Okay, I'm trying to
work towards this.

1061
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:20,106
Look, what I'm about to
tell you gonna sound crazy.

1062
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:22,071
You ready?
All right.

1063
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:24,242
Try me.

1064
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:27,415
I believe they've been
abducting black people,

1065
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:31,217
<i>brainwashing 'em, making 'em work
for 'em as sex slaves and shit.</i>

1066
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:32,748
Oh, sorry about the "shit."

1067
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:34,617
Sorry.

1068
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,591
Hold on a second.

1069
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,364
Then he sent me some
weird picture and I'm like,

1070
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:45,871
"Oh, man,
that's Andre Hayworth."

1071
01:17:45,928 --> 01:17:47,373
This dude been missing
for six months, right?

1072
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,739
So I do all my research, you
know, 'cause as a TSA agent...

1073
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:52,210
You guys are detectives? I got
the same training, you know?

1074
01:17:52,268 --> 01:17:53,872
We might know more
than y'all sometimes.

1075
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:55,777
'Cause we dealin' with
some terrorist shit, so...

1076
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:57,110
But that's a
totally different story.

1077
01:17:57,273 --> 01:17:59,879
So, look, I go do
my detective work, right?

1078
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:01,988
And I start putting
pieces together.

1079
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:03,556
And' see, this is
what I came up with.

1080
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:08,220
They're probably abducting black people,
brainwashing 'em and making 'em slaves.

1081
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:11,888
Or sex slaves. Not just regular
slaves, but sex slaves and shit.

1082
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:17,128
See, I don't know if it's the hypnosis
that's making 'em slaves or whatnot,

1083
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,834
but all I know is they already
got two brothers we know,

1084
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:23,500
and there could be a whole bunch
of brothers they got already.

1085
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:25,467
What's the next move?

1086
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:40,092
And don't ever, ever say that
I don't do nothin' for you.

1087
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:47,433
Oh! White girls.
Oh, they get you every time.

1088
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:48,490
Oh!

1089
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,464
Magic ain't real.

1090
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,142
None of this shit makes sense.

1091
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:13,682
<i>Hello?</i>

1092
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:15,718
<i>Chris?</i>

1093
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:17,188
Yo, um...

1094
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:21,291
Hey, what up?
Rose, it's me, Rod.

1095
01:19:21,457 --> 01:19:22,458
<i>Hi.</i>

1096
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:25,061
Where's Chris?

1097
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:28,805
He left two days ago.

1098
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:30,036
He left?

1099
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:34,505
Yeah. He got all paranoid,
and then he freaked out on me.

1100
01:19:34,837 --> 01:19:38,046
And then he just got
in a cab and left his phone.

1101
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:41,017
Wait. You haven't seen him?

1102
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:42,917
No, he never came back here.

1103
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:44,919
Oh, my God.

1104
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:48,888
Look, look, I've been calling
his phone a bunch of times.

1105
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:50,520
Matter of fact,
I went to the police.

1106
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,163
What did you say?

1107
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:54,899
I just said he was missing.

1108
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:57,197
Oh, good. Uh...

1109
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:00,202
Let me ask you somethin'.

1110
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:05,170
What cab company
did he, uh, use to leave'?

1111
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:06,406
Oh, gosh.

1112
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:10,780
I don't know. I guess
maybe a local one.

1113
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:13,683
Or I guess he could've
called an Uber?

1114
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:16,746
Um, wait. I'm so confused.

1115
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:19,857
Oh, you confused? Okay.

1116
01:20:20,716 --> 01:20:22,195
You know somethin'? Me too.

1117
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:23,853
Could you hold on one second?
Okay.

1118
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:25,225
Okay. Hold on.

1119
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:31,265
You lyin' bitch. She is lyin' like
a motherfucker. I know that...

1120
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,769
Ooh, that TSA shit tingles.
This motherfuckers lying.

1121
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:38,602
Okay, I got you.
I'm gonna record your ass.

1122
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,039
I'mma record
the shit outta you.

1123
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:43,777
You talk too goddamn much.
You're gonna say somethin'.

1124
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:45,543
Hold on. Record.

1125
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:47,880
Speaker.

1126
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:49,714
Unmute.

1127
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:52,448
Uh, Rose?

1128
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:54,150
<i>Uh-huh?
Um...</i>

1129
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:58,122
So last time I talked to Chris, he
told me your mama hypnotized him.

1130
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,392
Rod, just stop.

1131
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:03,091
<i>Huh?</i>

1132
01:21:06,462 --> 01:21:07,805
I know why you're calling.

1133
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,465
Why is that?

1134
01:21:10,933 --> 01:21:13,004
It's kind of obvious,
don't you think?

1135
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:14,970
<i>What?</i>

1136
01:21:16,138 --> 01:21:18,015
That there's something
between us.

1137
01:21:18,507 --> 01:21:20,680
No. What you talkin' about, girl'?
I called you about Chris.

1138
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:24,623
No, Rod, whenever we'd go out,
I remember you looking at me.

1139
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,853
What the fuck you...
No! Chris is my best friend.

1140
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:28,155
<i>Look, if you did
somethin' to him...</i>

1141
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,628
I know you think about
fucking me, Rod.

1142
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:33,257
<i>Ain't nobody thought about fucking you.
Why would you say some stupid shit?</i>

1143
01:21:33,322 --> 01:21:35,962
<i>What the... You ass! Fuck you!
I didn't wanna...</i>

1144
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,435
Fuck you! Bye!

1145
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:39,530
Shit!

1146
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:43,174
God! She's so...
She's a fuckin'... She's a...

1147
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:44,500
She's a genius.

1148
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:21,378
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1149
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:26,879
<i>Hey, Chris.</i>

1150
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:28,719
<i>How's it going, buddy?</i>

1151
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:33,188
<i>You can answer. There's
an intercom in the mom.</i>

1152
01:22:35,017 --> 01:22:36,655
Where's Rose?

1153
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:38,388
<i>Oh, you dirty dog.</i>

1154
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:42,661
<i>You're one of the lucky ones,
trust me.</i>

1155
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:46,433
<i>Jeremy's wrangling method
sounds way less pleasant.</i>

1156
01:22:46,862 --> 01:22:50,207
<i>I'm supposed to answer
any outstanding questions,</i>

1157
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:52,845
<i>concerns you may have so {an.</i>

1158
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:57,111
<i>Apparently, our common
understanding m' the process</i>

1159
01:22:57,239 --> 01:23:00,243
<i>has a positive impact on the
success rate of the procedure.</i>

1160
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:07,023
<i>You could give a shit,
right? Okay.</i>

1161
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:10,022
<i>Lei me just tel! you
what it is.</i>

1162
01:23:10,786 --> 01:23:14,461
<i>Phase one was the hypnotism.</i>

1163
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:16,399
<i>That's how they sedate you.</i>

1164
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,529
<i>Phase two is this.</i>

1165
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:22,303
<i>Menal preparation. It's
basicaliy psychological pre-op.</i>

1166
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:25,803
<i>Pre-op?</i>

1167
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:27,478
<i>For phase three.</i>

1168
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:30,746
<i>The transplantation.</i>

1169
01:23:33,609 --> 01:23:35,418
<i>Well, partial, actually.</i>

1170
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:39,721
<i>The piece of your brain connected
to your nervous system</i>

1171
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:44,457
<i>needs to stay put, keeping those
intricate connections intact.</i>

1172
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:48,066
<i>So you won't be gone,
not completely.</i>

1173
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:52,333
<i>A sliver of you will still be in there.
somewhere. limited consciousness.</i>

1174
01:23:56,999 --> 01:23:59,411
<i>You'll be able to see and hear</i>

1175
01:24:01,103 --> 01:24:02,411
<i>what your body is doing,</i>

1176
01:24:03,305 --> 01:24:06,684
<i>but your existence
will be as a passenger.</i>

1177
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:13,991
<i>An audience. You?! live in...</i>

1178
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:15,823
The Sunken Place.

1179
01:24:16,318 --> 01:24:18,320
Now you're in
the Sunken Place.

1180
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:25,495
<i>Yeah. That's what
she calls it.</i>

1181
01:24:26,695 --> 01:24:30,165
Now, I'll control the motor
functions, so I'll be...

1182
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:31,266
Me.

1183
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:34,711
You'll be me.

1184
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,510
Good, good.

1185
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:40,179
<i>You go! it quick. Good on you.</i>

1186
01:24:41,877 --> 01:24:43,356
Why us, huh?

1187
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:47,954
Why black people?

1188
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:52,697
<i>Who knows?</i>

1189
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:56,829
<i>People want a change.
Some people wanna be stronger,</i>

1190
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:59,866
<i>faster, cooler.</i>

1191
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,871
Black is in fashion.

1192
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:06,877
<i>But please don't lump me in with that. I
could give a shit what color you are.</i>

1193
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:11,245
<i>No. What I want is deepen.</i>

1194
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:16,746
<i>I want your eye, man.</i>

1195
01:25:18,714 --> 01:25:21,354
<i>I want those things
you see through.</i>

1196
01:25:23,552 --> 01:25:25,259
This is crazy.

1197
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:29,229
<i>Okay, I'm done.</i>

1198
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:07,934
No, no, no, no.

1199
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:03,807
Jeremy?

1200
01:31:24,245 --> 01:31:25,417
You fuck!

1201
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:27,082
You fuck.

1202
01:31:32,454 --> 01:31:34,764
Fuck you!

1203
01:31:37,358 --> 01:31:39,599
Come on! Come on!

1204
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:46,271
One Mississippi.
Two Mississippi.

1205
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:50,245
Three Mississippi.
Four Mississippi.

1206
01:33:19,861 --> 01:33:21,340
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

1207
01:33:21,496 --> 01:33:24,375
I'm at the Armitage house.
My name is Chris.

1208
01:33:24,499 --> 01:33:26,206
<i>I'm sorry, sir,
can you repeat that?</i>

1209
01:33:27,035 --> 01:33:28,378
I'm at the Armitage...

1210
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:44,924
No, no, no.
Don't do it, don't do it.

1211
01:33:45,086 --> 01:33:47,362
Don't do it. Just fuckin' go.

1212
01:34:10,178 --> 01:34:11,452
Grandma.

1213
01:34:26,761 --> 01:34:30,265
You ruined my house!

1214
01:35:14,242 --> 01:35:15,653
Get him, Grandpa.

1215
01:35:33,494 --> 01:35:34,700
Damn you!

1216
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:55,626
Let me do it.

1217
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:09,966
<i>Chris, I'm so sorry.</i>

1218
01:37:11,726 --> 01:37:12,932
It's me.

1219
01:37:15,363 --> 01:37:16,740
And I love you.

1220
01:37:17,098 --> 01:37:18,441
I love you.

1221
01:37:20,101 --> 01:37:21,444
I love you.

1222
01:38:10,318 --> 01:38:12,491
