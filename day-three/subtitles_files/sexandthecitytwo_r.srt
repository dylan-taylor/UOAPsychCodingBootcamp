1
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,860
<i>CARRIE: Once upon a long time ago,
there was an island...</i>

2
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,420
...some Dutch, some Indians
and some beads.

3
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,740
And those beads led to steamboats
and skyscrapers...

4
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,540
...Wall Street and electric lights...

5
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,420
...newspapers, Ellis Island, the Yankees...

6
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,670
...Central Park and the first World's Fair...

7
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,220
...Broadway, the Chrysler Building
and Studio 54.

8
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,550
I like to think of that
as New York City B.C.:

9
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,890
Before Carrie.

10
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,680
Hi, guys.

11
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,100
I arrived on this island
at exactly 3:30 p.m...

12
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,400
...on Tuesday, June 11th, 1986.

13
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,490
Oh. Oh!

14
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,290
Cab! Cab, cab, cab! Taxi! Ca--!

15
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,670
It seems like only yesterday.

16
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,460
Taxi!

17
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,880
Thank you.

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,220
The very next year, I met Charlotte.

19
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,350
We were on a subway car at 2 a.m.
when a homeless man dropped his pants.

20
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,450
Miranda and I met in 1989
at Bloomingdale's.

21
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,660
I was working in the dress department.

22
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,040
She was crying in the changing room.

23
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,130
-Hey.
-Hey.

24
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,630
Hi. How are you?

25
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,470
I met Samantha when she was
bartending at CBGB's.

26
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,730
- Bite me!
- My place or yours?

27
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,230
-Hi.
-How are you?

28
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,570
Let's go.

29
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,940
Hi.

30
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,280
Ready?

31
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,860
Time is a funny thing.

32
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,700
A decade can flash by
in an uneventful second.

33
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,330
And then, in just two years,
monumental things can happen.

34
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,840
Things you couldn't imagine happening
in a million years.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,210
Welcome to Bergdorf Goodman.
May I help you?

36
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,300
Yes, our friend is getting married.

37
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,220
-I never thought I'd see this day.
-You and me both.

38
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,720
Hell just froze over.

39
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,010
-What's the name?
-Oh, Blatch. It's Stanford Blatch.

40
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,480
Actually, I think they're registered
under both names.

41
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,650
Her best gay friend
is marrying my best gay friend.

42
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,520
-That's wonderful.
-I know.

43
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,820
-Let me get the registry.
-Thanks.

44
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,700
How did this even happen?
I thought they hated each other.

45
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,820
It's like musical chairs. The music stopped
and they were the last two left standing.

46
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,120
When you thought everyone you knew was
too old to get married, here come the gays.

47
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,140
And so, one weekend, we all gathered
at a charming inn in Connecticut...

48
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,510
...where the view was breathtaking...

49
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,850
...and the wedding was legal.

50
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,400
How's my tie?

51
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,690
-How's my tie?
-Wow.

52
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,610
You didn't tell me you were wearing that.

53
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,200
Well, I am the best man.

54
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,370
Oh, and you need a little help here.

55
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,660
So is a gay wedding shorter or longer
than a straight wedding?

56
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,540
-Why?
-Just wanna know what I'm in for.

57
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,420
Well, I think the marriage ceremony
is about the same...

58
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,760
...but I have no idea how long
the sacrificing of the straight men will take.

59
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,430
There you go.

60
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,720
Don't make me look too good.
Gay wedding.

61
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,690
Will you please stop referring to this
as a gay wedding?

62
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,400
Well, isn't it a gay wedding?

63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,570
Well, yes, but it's not just a gay wedding.

64
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,400
It's Stanford and Anthony's wedding.

65
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,820
-Mm. Got it.
-Mm-hm.

66
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,950
Whoops. Your fly is down.

67
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,660
Better let me.
These things can be tricky.

68
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,000
You did not pull it up.

69
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,170
I have to be there in an hour.
I'm the best man.

70
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,550
Then I better do my best.

71
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,840
Don't wanna be late
to my first gay wedding.

72
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,090
This is not a gay wedding.

73
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,930
Wasting time talking.

74
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,270
Oh, come on, you're not gonna.

75
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,900
If ever I would leave you

76
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,570
It wouldn't be in summer

77
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,120
Seeing you in summer

78
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,120
Okay, it's a gay wedding.

79
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,960
Your hair streaked with sunlight

80
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,170
Hey.

81
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,970
-Hey.
-Hello.

82
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,840
-White enough?
-This is what it looks like...

83
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,970
...when you stare directly into the sun.

84
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,890
Well, I think it's beautiful.

85
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,020
Oh, this wedding is way more
than beautiful.

86
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,230
It's Lady Di.

87
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,440
- Mommy, can I go look at the swans?
- Yes, honey.

88
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,650
Sure, baby.
Stay where we can see you, okay?

89
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,320
- Right there.
- Hi, swans.

90
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,820
Oh, there's Samantha. Hey.
- You brought your dog?

91
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,910
It's a gay wedding. I figured, what's
one more little bitch with an attitude?

92
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,250
You guys, shouldn't we be
a little bit more PC?

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Char!

94
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,210
Anthony! Hey.

95
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,670
Can you believe this place?

96
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,500
It looks like the Snow Queen exploded.

97
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,420
-How's that for PC?
-True.

98
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,840
So you're not the wedding planner?

99
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,180
Hell to the no. I pulled out
when Stanford mentioned swans.

100
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,520
Finally, I just threw up my arms,
whatever he wants, give it to him.

101
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Aw.

102
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,690
Yep, Stanford gets the wedding
of his dreams and I get to cheat.

103
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,860
And don't give me that face, Char.

104
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,570
Just because I'm getting married doesn't
mean I have to change who I am.

105
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,070
So you're allowed to cheat
because you're gay?

106
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,360
No, because I'm Italian.

107
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,620
Carrie, Stanford's looking for you.

108
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,950
Cute hat.

109
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,370
- Anthony.
- Coming.

110
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't get it.
Why get married if you're gonna cheat?

111
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,080
Well, he didn't say he was going to cheat,
he just said he was allowed to cheat.

112
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,460
Is that how you heard it?

113
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,510
-Well, it's not really any of our business.
-Except, he told us.

114
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,050
I'm just saying, I think every couple
has the right to make their own rules.

115
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,810
Well, not really. It's marriage.

116
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,850
-Hey, who wants a cocktail?
-Oh, I do.

117
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,690
And see if they have any food.
I need a little nosh.

118
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,820
Eight years later, she's finally a Jew.

119
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,740
There were bells on a hill

120
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,580
Oh, Stanny. You're wearing white.

121
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,080
Like a virgin.

122
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,460
Touched for the very first time.

123
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,340
Hi.

124
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,800
So, what do you think of everything?

125
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,170
You have swans.

126
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,930
-Too much?
-When are swans ever too much?

127
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,010
I don't know what came over me.

128
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,060
Remember that summer
when I got hooked on coke?

129
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,770
-Mm.
-This was like that.

130
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,770
Well, you dropped quite a bundle.

131
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,520
Well, I've been saving for this day
since I was 19.

132
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,650
You always knew you
were gonna get married?

133
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,530
Yes. I just thought it would be
to a chubby, patient Jewish girl.

134
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,370
FYI, Anthony's out there telling people
he's allowed to cheat.

135
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,080
I know.

136
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,460
He hates the tradition
so he pushes against it.

137
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,040
So he is allowed to cheat?

138
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,500
Yes, but only in the 45 states where
we're not legally married.

139
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,130
Okay, now you do mine.

140
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,680
"Carrie Preston"?

141
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,560
What?

142
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,850
Nothing, I'm just surprised not
to be "Bradshaw" at your wedding.

143
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,150
The wedding planner said that couples
are always listed under their married names.

144
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,900
Oh, that makes sense.

145
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,650
Are you taking Anthony's name?

146
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
No. We're guys.

147
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,990
"Guys"? Have you seen yourself
in the mirror, Lady Dior?

148
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,160
Bitch.

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,170
-Hey, did anybody send up my, um--?
-Oh.

150
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,340
Now, the boutonniere may say "Preston."

151
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,340
But the hat...

152
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,770
...says "Bradshaw."

153
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,730
Sunrise, sunset

154
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,780
Sunrise, sunset

155
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:22,370
Swiftly flow the days

156
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:29,460
Seedlings turn overnight
To sunflowers

157
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:36,090
Blossoming even as we gaze

158
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,300
Sunrise, sunset

159
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,800
Who's that hot straight guy with Carrie?

160
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,260
-That's Anthony's brother, Nicky.
-How can you tell that he's straight?

161
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,310
It's a gift.

162
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,740
Could this wedding get any gayer?

163
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,240
Look who's marrying them.

164
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,080
Oh, my--

165
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,790
Sunrise, sunset

166
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,750
Why would Liza say yes to this?

167
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,040
It's a law of physics.

168
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,460
Any time there's this much gay energy
in one room, Liza manifests.

169
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,680
Another

170
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,760
Laden with happiness

171
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,890
And tears

172
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,780
A little while later, it was time for
Stanford and Anthony to exchange vows.

173
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,490
And now, the brooms have written their
own v-- "Brooms"?

174
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,910
Bride, groom. Broom.

175
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,330
Oh, broom. Oh, that's marvelous.

176
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,210
Thank you, Liza Minnelli.

177
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,590
Quiet, now.

178
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,300
Weddings are serious.

179
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,680
At least that's what I've heard.

180
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,140
"It was not exactly love at first sight.

181
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,530
But it turns out, it was love.

182
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,860
You are the first man to accept me...

183
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,330
...for the man that I actually am."

184
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,670
That's the thing about tradition.

185
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,000
Like it or not, it sneaks in.

186
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,130
Mazeltov!

187
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,300
Congratulations.

188
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,180
- All the single ladies
- All the single ladies

189
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,560
-All the single ladies
-All the single ladies

190
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,980
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

191
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,520
Up in the club
We just broke up

192
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,030
I'm doing my own little thing

193
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,700
You decided to dip
But now you wanna trip

194
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,620
'Cause another guy noticed me

195
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,700
I'm up on him
He's up on me

196
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,200
Don't pay him any attention

197
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,620
Cried my tears
Three good years

198
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,120
Can't be mad at me

199
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,710
'Cause if you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

200
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,090
If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

201
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,670
Don't be mad
Once you see that he wants it

202
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,130
If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

203
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,970
Whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

204
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,890
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

205
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,600
Whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

206
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,270
Whoa, oh
Oh, oh, oh

207
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,270
Don't treat me to the things
Of the world

208
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,280
I'm not that kind of girl

209
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,610
Hey. How's everything?

210
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,570
Fine. Rose is giving her a hard time.

211
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,240
Should I go up to the room?

212
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,410
What was the point of bringing
the nanny out here, then?

213
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,910
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah, Rose is just driving us a little crazy.

214
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,750
No, not crazy. She's just a little fussy.
Everything's fine.

215
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,170
If you don't you'll be alone

216
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:10,930
And like a ghost I'll be gone

217
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,350
If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

218
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,850
If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

219
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,440
Don't be mad
Once you see that he wants it

220
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,270
If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

221
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

222
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,860
If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

223
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,320
Don't be mad
Once you see that he wants it

224
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,570
If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring

225
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,910
Oh, ohh, ohhhh

226
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,710
Good luck.

227
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,050
Now I know why we got married.

228
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,800
So we wouldn't have to dance
to that song at weddings.

229
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,060
That the only reason?

230
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,560
Yeah.

231
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,020
-I have to try on your crown.
-Oh, you have to.

232
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,820
I'm sorry.

233
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,240
-Hey, I'm kissing here.
-I have to. It's from him.

234
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,820
It's Saturday. You're at a wedding.

235
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,660
Did I mention that he hates me?

236
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,580
Who would dare hate you?

237
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,040
The new senior law partner at her firm.
He rides her ass nonstop.

238
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,580
- Why?
- No idea.

239
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,880
It's like he can't stand the sound
of my voice.

240
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,670
Every time I open my mouth,
he shuts me down.

241
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,590
Sometimes he holds his hand up like this:

242
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,050
-Ew!
-Yeah. He hates me less over e-mail.

243
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,970
How's it going?

244
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,140
Good. Thanks.

245
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,850
Enjoy.

246
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,020
You have a nice night.

247
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,690
You have a nice night.

248
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,370
-Thank you.
-A guy just hit on me.

249
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,210
Really?

250
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,920
How's it make you feel?

251
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,300
Like I still got it.

252
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,380
You most certainly do.

253
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,220
-So sorry to bother you. I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

254
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,300
-I'm so sorry to bother you.
-It's okay.

255
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,970
I've just been reading your books
for years and your column.

256
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,940
I swear,
we had the exact same dating life.

257
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,400
- Wow.
- Cut to the chase, Ellen.

258
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,730
She means she is you.

259
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,570
I am. I am you.

260
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,450
Well, in that case, may I introduce
you to your husband, John James Preston.

261
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,910
-Hi.
-Good to meet you.

262
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,910
-Hey.
-How long have you been married?

263
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,120
Well, it'll be two years next month.

264
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,580
We're married two years next month
as well.

265
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,080
- Wow. You are me.
- I guess.

266
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,630
We're expecting a baby, and get this:
the due date is our anniversary.

267
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,130
Well, I'm not pregnant.
Well, I guess that's obvious.

268
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,680
-Surrogate.
-Wow. Congratulations.

269
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,350
You guys have kids?

270
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,930
If you need a surrogate service,
ours was flawless.

271
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,100
Oh, no, thanks. It's not a surrogate
situation. We're just not having children.

272
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,940
You don't want kids?

273
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,940
Well, no, we love them.

274
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,520
It's just not for us.

275
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,400
So it's going to be just...

276
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,610
...you two?

277
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,870
Uh, but she does have a new book
coming out next month.

278
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,620
Great. Great. And what's that about?

279
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,460
Marriage.

280
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,750
Well....

281
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,050
Have a nice night.

282
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,390
And all this time I thought Samantha
was my publicist.

283
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,060
I had to say something. She looked like
someone told her there was no Santa.

284
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,810
May I have your attention, please?

285
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,650
My son and his husband would like to ask
all couples to join them on the dance floor.

286
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,400
Oh, that's very nice, dear.

287
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,070
Ohhh.

288
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,490
You're done. We're going to dance.

289
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,830
Fake to the right. Nice.

290
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,170
I'm done. I'm done. I'm done!

291
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,170
Dance me.

292
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,340
May I have the honor, Mrs. Goldenblatt?

293
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,380
You most certainly may.

294
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,680
Sad sensation

295
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,760
Lately I've not slept a wink

296
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,520
- Come on, honey.
- Come on, sweetie.

297
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,730
Let's go dance.

298
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,560
Care to dance?

299
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,020
Just us two?

300
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,650
Samantha, you look amazing.

301
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,410
Oh, yes, you do.
What have you had done?

302
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,370
Nothing. I'm 100 percent natural.

303
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,870
I'm serious. I need names.

304
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,420
-Gentlemen.
-I heard that.

305
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,060
You looked pretty hot out there before.
Wanna dance again?

306
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,230
I can think of so many other more
fun things I'd rather do with you.

307
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,310
-I'm Nicky.
-Samantha.

308
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,980
Nice to meet you, Samantha.

309
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,900
What do you do for a living, Nicky?

310
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
-I lay concrete.
-That sounds promising.

311
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,530
- Yeah. Yeah!
- Yeah!

312
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,030
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

313
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,080
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

314
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,500
- Yeah!
- What the--?

315
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,370
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

316
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,620
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

317
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,250
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

318
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,260
Rose, come on, now.
Come on, now. Sleepy time.

319
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,930
Rose. Come on.

320
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,600
Rose, Rose, Rose.

321
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,440
-Please?
-Good. Good. Here?

322
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,230
Let's go sleepy.

323
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,940
Please, Rose?

324
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,400
Come on, come on.

325
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,160
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

326
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,620
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

327
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,620
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

328
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,710
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

329
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,710
-I don't know which is worse.
-Samantha.

330
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,710
The baby will tire eventually.

331
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,960
Let's get a little white noise.

332
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,470
Right from your home.
Amnesty International.

333
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,310
Visit any location. Lumber Liquid--

334
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,810
Where do you want to--?

335
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,100
- Jackpot.
- Do you mind if I try?

336
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,310
A little black-and-white noise.

337
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,780
It Happened One Night.

338
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,650
Never seen it.

339
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,320
Well, kid, you are in for a treat.

340
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,740
Climb up in here.

341
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,660
What are you gonna do?

342
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,210
A system all my own.

343
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,300
Oh, that's shocking.

344
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,510
For the '30s, it was.

345
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,510
Did you see it when it opened originally?

346
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,020
Aren't you going to give me
a little credit?

347
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,060
She's pretty.

348
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,900
She's got nothing on you.

349
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,610
There Big and I were...

350
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,780
...somewhere between wild sex
and a baby.

351
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,370
-Hey, you.
-Hey, how are you?

352
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,630
- Hi, guys.
- How are you?

353
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,380
Thanks.

354
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,380
-Ready to order?
-Um, I think we'll wait for our friend.

355
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,590
- Okay. Yup.
- Thanks.

356
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,050
Okay. Yeah, that sounds great. Yeah.
- That's a whole lot of health.

357
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,810
-How many are there?
-Forty-four.

358
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,230
I'm on the one-a-day Fruity Pebbles plan.

359
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,900
Women our age shouldn't joke
about vitamins.

360
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,110
Women who are not our age shouldn't
say "women our age."

361
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,240
-Yeah.
-Well, one day very soon you will thank me.

362
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,740
I am leading the way
through the menopause maze.

363
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,580
With my vitamins, my melatonin sleep
patches, my bioidentical estrogen cream...

364
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,580
...progesterone cream,
a touch of testosterone--

365
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,120
-She's the hormone whisperer.
-I am.

366
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:21,170
I've tricked my body
into thinking it's younger.

367
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,500
I've tricked my body
into thinking it's thinner. Spanx.

368
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,130
And I'm telling you, no hot flashes,
no mood swings...

369
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,260
...and my sex drive,
it's right back to where it was.

370
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,060
-Really? Hadn't heard.
-Where are you getting your information?

371
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,310
From Suzanne Somers
and her team of doctors.

372
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,440
I'll get you a copy. It's a revelation.

373
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,110
You're taking medical advice from
the woman who invented the ThighMaster?

374
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,320
Damn right. Have you seen my thighs?

375
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,320
Okay, go ahead, laugh. It's working.

376
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,990
By the time you ladies are 50, I'll be 35.

377
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,040
Take Mommy's hand.
- Oh, here she is.

378
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,370
I thought it was just gonna be
the four of us.

379
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,210
Don't worry, the nanny will be here.

380
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,540
Harry's just not back from playing golf.

381
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,960
Oh, here.

382
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,130
Let me hold that pretty
little morning Rose.

383
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,880
No. No.
- Okay, no sale.

384
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,220
She just learned the word "no."

385
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,390
Good for her. We're hoping Samantha
learns it one of these days.

386
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,430
-Terrible twos.
-She's not terrible.

387
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,640
No, of course, she's not terrible.
The terrible twos are terrible.

388
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:18,980
Right.

389
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,810
She's in the "I only want Mommy" phase.

390
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,980
And me and Erin.

391
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,320
That's right. Just you and me and Erin.

392
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,150
-Who's Erin?
-Her nanny.

393
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,110
How are you gonna swallow all those?

394
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,660
Have we met?

395
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,990
Erin!

396
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,840
-Good morning, ladies.
-Morning.

397
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,590
I hear it was quite the glorious wedding.

398
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,010
It was.

399
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,390
Oh, and you must be
the famous Samantha.

400
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,850
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

401
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,690
Now, I know a little girl...

402
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,570
...who would just love to practice
her cartwheels on the lawn.

403
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,240
- Yay.
- Yay.

404
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,700
Do you have the sunblock?

405
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,030
Come to me, you little pet.

406
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,530
There you go.

407
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,040
-Yes.
-You have yourselves a lovely morning.

408
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,040
- You too.
- Thanks, Erin.

409
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,250
-Oh, that is so sweet.
-I know.

410
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,130
That's your nanny?

411
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,590
Yes, that's Erin.

412
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,260
You mean Erin Go Braless.

413
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,220
Ha, ha. She doesn't wear a bra.

414
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,390
-Was she wearing a bra at the job interview?
-I don't know.

415
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,720
I was too busy thinking about her degree
in Children's Education...

416
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,730
-...and how much the girls liked her.
-Her tits never came up?

417
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,600
No, her tits never came up.

418
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,570
- And she's amazing.
- Well, I'm sure she is.

419
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,820
But, honey, there ought to be a law
against hiring a nanny that looks like that.

420
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,650
Yeah, the Jude Law.

421
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,530
- Are we ready?
- Yes, I think so.

422
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,950
- One, two, three!
- Yeah, go!

423
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:07,500
That's a good girl! One more time!

424
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:19,140
It seems it wasn't only the children that
were captivated by Charlotte's Irish nanny...

425
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,600
...and her lucky charms.

426
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:33,610
And later that day,
Big and I arrived home.

427
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,990
- Hot in here.
- Yeah.

428
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,910
I'll get the air in the bedroom.

429
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,910
-You get the living room.
-Okay.

430
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,130
After Big and I sold the extravagant
rooftop penthouse...

431
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,170
...we thought we were meant to live in...

432
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,920
...we decided that maybe we needed
to come a little more down to earth.

433
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,130
So we did.

434
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,640
Twelve floors, to be exact.

435
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,890
We may be closer to earth...

436
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,100
...but we kept a little bit of heaven.

437
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,340
We've got excellent panels,
some of the best blinds....

438
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,880
It's 4:30. Where should
I make reservations? Any cravings?

439
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,380
Don't we have anything to eat here?

440
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,970
Nothing?

441
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,390
Come on. You knew when you married me
I was more Coco Chanel than coq au vin.

442
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,850
Let's just order in.

443
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,730
We ordered in two nights last week.

444
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,190
Well, we've been out all weekend.

445
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,530
Let's just stay home.

446
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,450
Okay.

447
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,250
-That couch is good, right?
-Mm-hm.

448
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,330
Worth the year and a half wait.

449
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,210
All we need is a piece for that corner
and we're done.

450
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,800
You did good, kid.

451
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,400
You know you have your shoes
on the couch, right?

452
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,780
Year and a half, I'm just saying.

453
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,580
-That must be the rest of the luggage.
-Oh, good.

454
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,960
For a minute I thought it might be
the shoe police.

455
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,500
And a few mornings later,
in a different home....

456
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,420
Why bring rat into New York house?

457
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,470
So Brady can win the
second grade science fair. Right, B-boy?

458
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,720
BRADY;
Yeah, I'm gonna win.

459
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,180
-Sit down, please, have some breakfast.
-I can't.

460
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,810
I have this presentation
and I'm sick to my stomach.

461
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,060
I used to love going to work
and now I'm sick at the thought of it.

462
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,610
Here.

463
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,570
-Two bites.
-Thanks, Magda.

464
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,780
You don't have to put
yourself through this.

465
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,280
I'm a lawyer. That's who I am.

466
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,200
Life's too short.
Go someplace where they appreciate you.

467
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,830
Until you find a better job, you can be home
and help out around the house.

468
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,410
I've waited too long to get here.

469
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,160
I just have to suck it up.

470
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,170
Yeah.

471
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,130
Mom, you gonna come
to the science fair today?

472
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,130
Sorry, honey, she can't. Mommy's--
- She has to go to work. Yeah.

473
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,140
We think that these new numbers
show a much more optimistic upside for us.

474
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,480
And the savings that we found
for the client...

475
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,440
...will easily make up
for any escalated legal fees that they incur.

476
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,690
So it's win-win.

477
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,480
It's totally win-win, Tom.
And what's more, based on--

478
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,320
Kevin, I'd like you to run
with this from here on.

479
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,780
But it's Miranda's case.

480
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,160
Actually, it's the firm's case,
and as senior partner, I'm--

481
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,290
Is there a problem?

482
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,370
I don't know. Is there?

483
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,830
Have something you'd like
to say to me in private?

484
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,500
I don't know that it needs
to be in private.

485
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,760
Okay, and we're all paying attention.

486
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,300
Honorable mention goes to Rachel
for "What is Static Electricity?"

487
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,430
-Let's give her a big hand.
-What...?

488
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,180
-I quit.
-Good for you.

489
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,810
-You okay?
-I'll get another job. A better job.

490
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,520
And I already called the headhunter.
Where's Brady?

491
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:46,700
Now, our first prize goes to Brady
for his Mouse Maze.

492
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,370
Hey, Mom, I won!

493
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,040
I made it.

494
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
I never make it.

495
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,040
- Good work, Brady.
- Good boy.

496
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,750
Your dolphin has got all the skills...

497
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,550
...and it's gonna have a little swim
with the crab.

498
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,260
Yes, it is, baby girl.

499
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,430
Hey, cutie, come look.
Now, what does this do here?

500
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,930
Look at this. Well, what is that gonna do?

501
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,990
There can be many tortured moments
in the life of someone...

502
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,000
...who spends her days writing books.

503
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,290
The antidote to those moments...

504
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,130
...is the moment the finished book
finally arrives.

505
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,110
-Hello?
-Do I have anything to worry about?

506
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,120
-Can you be more specific?
-I mean with the nanny and Harry.

507
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,450
That's just Samantha.

508
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,950
You're the one who said that thing
about Jude Law.

509
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,040
Oh, sweetie, it was a joke. You know,
it was right there, I had to go for it.

510
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:23,630
-And it was funny.
-No, no, I really wish I hadn't said it.

511
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,960
-Look, Mommy.
-Just a second, honey...

512
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,340
...I just have to finish these cupcakes
for the party tomorrow, okay?

513
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,390
-Hey, wait, what was I saying?
-Should you be threatened.

514
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,640
Did I say "threatened"?

515
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,810
Uh....

516
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,720
-Should I be threatened?
-Look, Mommy, look.

517
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,520
Okay, honey. Let me just put Rose
in her chair. Carrie?

518
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,520
I'm gonna put you down for a second.

519
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,980
I'm gonna put the baby down,
I'll be right back.

520
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,030
-Ooh.
-It's okay. It's okay, sweetheart.

521
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,320
- Oh, I know.
- Look, Mommy, look.

522
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,990
Oh, precious.

523
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,820
- Look at me.
- It's okay.

524
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:58,450
Look. Look.

525
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,830
Okay, I'm listening.

526
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,330
Well, did you have any worries
before the Samantha comment?

527
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,000
No, of course not.

528
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:09,050
I love Erin and I trust Harry.

529
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,340
I believe you just answered
your own question.

530
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,550
Me, me, me!

531
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,350
Lily! This skirt is vintage.

532
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,520
-What skirt?
-It's the cream Valentino.

533
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,520
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

534
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,560
I've gotta go!

535
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,230
Lily, look at what you did!

536
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:33,860
Mommy just has to get something, okay?

537
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,500
Mommy.

538
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,500
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

539
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,710
Mommy will be out in a minute.

540
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,050
Mommy, Mommy.

541
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,090
Mommy.

542
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,760
I was just getting more sprinkles.

543
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,180
Girls.

544
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:05,190
Let's go and play in my bedroom.

545
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,650
Mommy needs some cooking time.

546
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,940
Charlotte was thankful
to have Erin come home at that moment.

547
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,700
Threat or no threat.

548
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,410
Bra or no bra.

549
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,570
Good. Come on, darling.

550
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,910
And from no bra
on the Upper East Side...

551
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,040
...to no panties in Times Square.

552
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,370
It's 12 and your lunch is at 12:30.

553
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,080
I'm just freshening up.

554
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,220
Call the restaurant and tell them
I'm going to be 15 minutes late.

555
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,090
Samantha Jones.

556
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,430
Smith Jerrod's on the phone.

557
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,270
Refresh my memory.

558
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,480
- How do we know each other again?
- You used to do my publicity.

559
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Doesn't ring a bell.

560
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,780
You used to do me.

561
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,490
Oh, ding, ding ding.

562
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,950
How's L.A.?

563
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,290
I'm in Abu Dhabi.

564
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,960
You're back in the Middle East?

565
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,790
Yeah. We're shooting the poster
for the movie I made here.

566
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,210
And I just found out
that we're premiering in New York.

567
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,920
I'm calling because I want you
on that red carpet next to me.

568
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,180
Smith.

569
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,340
-You do?
-Hell, yeah.

570
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,310
My career never would've happened
without you.

571
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,390
Who else would I take to my big night?

572
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,980
That is so sweet.

573
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,650
Oh. Honey? I gotta go.

574
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,530
I'm pulling up my panties
to get to a lunch date.

575
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,160
Not to brag...

576
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,330
...but did I make us
a delicious anniversary meal?

577
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,830
It was delicious.

578
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,660
And you did brag.

579
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,330
Oops.

580
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,000
You have a little osso buco right...

581
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,130
...there.

582
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,680
See, that's one of the perks of eating
at home. You get to kiss the cook.

583
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,850
And no tipping.

584
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,970
-More wine?
-Yes, please.

585
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,950
Happy anniversary.

586
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,830
-Now?
-Yes, now.

587
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,040
Before I'm lulled into a coma
by your light Milanese fare.

588
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,640
-Very nice.
-It's vintage. It's from 1968.

589
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,310
Very, very nice.

590
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:58,730
And it's engraved.

591
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,740
"Me and you.

592
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,280
Just us two."

593
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,010
Your gift is in the bedroom.

594
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,430
There better be something in there
I haven't already seen.

595
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,150
Well, I've seen the desk.

596
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,450
But you haven't seen
what's in the desk.

597
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,370
A state-of-the-art flat-screen.

598
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,840
And when
bedtime comes, take them in your arms...

599
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,750
-And....
-...into your dreams.

600
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,800
WowWee Alive comes in pups.
Each sold separately from WowWee.

601
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,810
So we can lay in bed and watch
old black-and-white movies.

602
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,190
The only word I heard
in that sentence was "old."

603
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,190
Come on.
You remember how nice it was...

604
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,480
...at the hotel watching
It Happened One Night.

605
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:24,150
Yes. And it was nice because
it only happened one night in a hotel.

606
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,990
Did I fuck up?

607
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:35,250
Well, a piece of jewelry
would've been nice.

608
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,580
Oh.

609
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,050
Can you get me and Big invited
to Smith's premiere?

610
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,010
-Oh, yeah, sure.
-Good.

611
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,970
I think we need some glamour.

612
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,810
You know, the television
and the ordering in...

613
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,190
...it's just getting
a little too "Mr. and Mrs. Married."

614
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:00,440
-You'll have a good time.
-Yeah. Ooh.

615
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,860
Look at that.

616
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,320
Very nice.

617
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,580
It is a fabulous dress for the premiere.

618
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,290
What's the worst thing
they could say about me in this dress?

619
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,450
Uh....

620
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,870
-"Who the hell does she think she is?"
-Just went to the top of my list.

621
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,130
So, um, you and Smith.

622
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,380
You're going
to this premiere together as...?

623
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,880
Oh, honey, just friends. But I may
throw him a fuck if I like the movie.

624
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,800
Oh, that's nice. That should take
the edge off the reviews.

625
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,260
Carrie. I haven't seen you here
in forever.

626
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,730
Yeah, I know. I've been cheating on fashion
with furniture.

627
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,440
-So, what can I help you with?
-Well, we need to find a red-carpet look...

628
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,070
-...for my friend Samantha.
-And I think we found it.

629
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,730
Is that maybe a little young?

630
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,950
I don't know.

631
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,950
Exactly how old do you think I am?

632
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,530
And not that it matters...

633
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,750
...but I am 50-fucking-2
and I will rock this dress.

634
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,500
I'll get you a changing room.

635
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,130
How's the writing going?
Still working for Vogue?

636
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,960
-Freelance.
-Oh, that's fabulous.

637
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,430
You had to do that to her?

638
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,260
Well, how else is she gonna learn?

639
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,510
And speaking of Vogue...

640
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,020
...they want you to write a piece
to accompany the release of your book.

641
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,560
Oh, great. Has there been any long-lead
press reaction to the book yet?

642
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,270
Not yet, but I'm sure it'll all be fabulous.

643
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,320
Is that you?

644
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,660
I hope so.

645
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,290
-Who else has a key?
-The Gristedes delivery boy.

646
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,120
Really?

647
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,960
Well, you know, you want food at home,
that's a risk you take.

648
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,960
Don't get too comfortable on that couch.
We have to be at the premiere in an hour.

649
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,260
-Is that tonight?
-Mm-hm.

650
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,840
-On a Monday?
-Yes.

651
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,180
We don't go out on Mondays.

652
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,970
Well, first of all,
I didn't know we didn't...

653
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,650
...and second of all, problem?

654
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,480
The market fell a hundred points...

655
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,690
...and now I have to get dressed up
and go to some Hollywood thing?

656
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,740
All you have to do
is put on a fresh shirt.

657
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,150
Can't you go without me?

658
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,450
I don't wanna go without you.
I wanna go with you.

659
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,660
That's the point.

660
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,830
Me and you out on the town.

661
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I've been out on the town for 30 years.

662
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,080
I've seen the town, kid.

663
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,090
You go have fun with your friends.

664
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,380
But I wanna spend time with you.

665
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,930
Oh, well, if you wanna spend time
with me, we'll stay here.

666
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,140
At our home. Which you made so perfect.

667
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,520
You just don't want to get your ass
off the couch.

668
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,770
All right, fine. Stay.

669
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,070
I'll go with Stanford.

670
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,940
Okay.

671
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,450
Information. What is it...?

672
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,910
What's that?

673
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,370
Oh, I picked up some dinner
from that new Japanese place on Madison.

674
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:16,050
--before their acquisition changed history,
before the merger, certainty...

675
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,600
...before action, knowledge.
Thomson Reuters.

676
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,560
Throw this back. We're going.

677
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,810
-I thought you just said--
-I changed my mind.

678
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,650
Do you really want to be pushed and shoved
in a crowd and eat bad catered food?

679
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:35,400
Yes. Yes. I'm dying
to be pushed and shoved in a crowd...

680
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,910
...and eat bad catered food.

681
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:41,870
I'm dying to eat anything
that doesn't come in a takeout box.

682
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,200
Bottoms up.

683
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,540
I'll put out a fresh shirt.

684
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,970
Fans on the right, take models to the left.

685
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,260
I think we're a little overdressed,
don't you?

686
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,890
Please walk off the red carpet.

687
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,600
Oh, we're VIPs. See?

688
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,060
Show your bracelets.

689
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,600
Show your bracelet.

690
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,270
Smith! Right here!

691
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,610
- One more.
- One more.

692
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,280
Samantha looks smoking hot.

693
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,860
Is that dress maybe a little young?

694
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,780
- Miley!
- Miley!

695
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,660
Miley!
- Maybe.

696
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,990
Mother of God.

697
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,870
She's wearing the same dress
as teen queen Miley Cyrus.

698
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:30,130
I know what's gonna happen,
but I can't look away.

699
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,130
It's a red-carpet Hindenburg.

700
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,220
- Right this way, Miley!
- Over here!

701
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,130
Awkward times two.

702
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,640
Miley! Miley, is that your mother?

703
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,140
Miley! Miley, right here! Miley!

704
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,480
Sometimes, a girlfriend
is a girl you've never even met.

705
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,810
Great dress.

706
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,730
Thanks for saying that.

707
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,070
And all is right in Hollywood.

708
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,110
-Ooh.
-Just got pushed.

709
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,620
In the VIP room at the after-party...

710
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,620
...Samantha found herself
in the middle of the Middle East...

711
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,420
...seated directly across
from the film's producer, Sheikh Khalid.

712
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:15,210
This is our first venture
into the world film market...

713
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,300
...and we are honored
to be represented...

714
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:21,510
...by such a magnificent American star
as Smith Jerrod.

715
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,720
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

716
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,100
But you should really be
thanking Samantha.

717
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,520
I mean, it's all her.
I was just a waiter before she came along.

718
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,900
She handled my public relations
and made everybody see me as a star.

719
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,980
Is this true?

720
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,520
Well...

721
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:36,980
...yes.

722
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,530
Have you ever been
to the United Arab Emirates?

723
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,280
No, and I could kick myself.

724
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:48,370
But friends of mine have been to Dubai
and they say it is amazing.

725
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,710
Dubai is--

726
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,540
I am at a loss for the word in English.

727
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,050
Dubai is over.

728
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,050
-Really?
-With all respect to my Emirate brother...

729
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,890
...Abu Dhabi is the future.

730
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:09,930
A progressive, global city of commerce,
culture and...

731
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,890
...style.

732
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:16,150
-It is the new Middle East.
-The new Middle East.

733
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,570
But you should see it for yourself.
As my guest, at my new hotel.

734
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,570
And if it does not interfere too much
with your wonderful time...

735
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,580
...we might be able
to discuss some business.

736
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,370
-Business?
-Perhaps you could make...

737
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,580
...America see my hotel as a star...

738
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,580
...as you did with Smith Jerrod.

739
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,010
And suddenly, it's all about the couch.

740
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,630
Two years ago, we never even
uttered the word "couch."

741
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,640
And now, our entire universe
revolves around it.

742
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,010
Count your blessings.

743
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,180
Remember when you couldn't even
get him to sleep over?

744
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,480
Yeah, I know. I know.

745
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,100
We're out tonight. He could at least slap
on a smile and have a good time.

746
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:58,940
Already had a nervous breakdown.
No, believe me--

747
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,440
He seems to be having a good time now.

748
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,610
People think that Spaniards don't work...

749
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,660
...that we just take siestas
and drink Rioja and go to the beach.

750
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,330
There was a jumbo shrimp free-for-all
at the raw bar.

751
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,210
-I'm gonna be-- I'll be right back.
-Okay.

752
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,000
Every night before bed,
I am on my knees praying:

753
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,380
"Please, God, let it stay up."

754
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:28,550
-Please let what stay up?
-Hi. The stock market.

755
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,220
-This is Carmen Garcia Carrion.
-Carrion.

756
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,640
-Carrion.
-Very good.

757
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,850
She is the Senior Vice President
of the Bank of Madrid.

758
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,650
- Hi.
- Hi.

759
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:39,820
-This is--
-Carrie Preston. Hi.

760
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,320
Oh, Carrie Preston. Nice to meet you.
Your husband is very charming.

761
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,990
Isn't he?

762
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,660
So you were right about the catered food
and the shoving.

763
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,240
So I'm ready to go whenever you are.

764
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,040
Oh.

765
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,120
-Well, nice to meet you both.
-Nice to meet you.

766
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,830
I'll try to keep it up for you.

767
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,800
-You're so funny. He's very funny.
-He is.

768
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,050
-Good night.
-Good night.

769
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,340
Bye. Good night.

770
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:07,550
Is that all you got?

771
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,060
I mean, all we're trying to do is just
keep from getting dead.

772
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,600
Damn!

773
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:22,190
Since the very first Deadliest Catch
cameras rolled seven seasons ago--

774
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,230
It's a little loud.

775
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,700
--the fleet has gone on
more than 60 voyages.

776
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:33,200
And for the record,
that is not a black-and-white movie.

777
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:34,790
What?

778
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:38,370
That was supposed to be
for black-and-white movies...

779
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:41,250
...and that
is not a black-and-white movie.

780
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,720
When the gay guy hit on me
at the wedding you thought it was funny.

781
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,050
I'm not upset about the flirt.

782
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:55,720
I like the flirt. In fact, you could dial up
the flirt around here a little more.

783
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,310
I get TV and take-out guy...

784
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,230
...and Bank of Madrid lady,
she gets sparkle guy.

785
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,820
I'm sorry. Are we having a discussion
or watching television?

786
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,070
What is it with you and this television?

787
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,240
I don't wanna be one of those couples...

788
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:16,450
...lying in bed,
watching television and not talking.

789
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,580
That is not the relationship
I signed up for.

790
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,630
It's a television,
not the end of the world.

791
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:25,170
Well, maybe to you it's not.

792
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,010
The Bering Sea has many faces.

793
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,850
You're not happy in,
and you're not happy out.

794
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,310
What does that mean?

795
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,270
Well, what do you want from me?

796
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,060
I put on the shirt, I went to the thing...

797
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:47,070
...and now you're hammering me
about lying in bed and watching a little TV?

798
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,030
I mean, what is the problem?

799
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,870
Look...

800
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:00,160
...it's just going to be you and me...

801
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:03,460
...every night, for the rest of our lives.

802
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,630
And I think that we are going...

803
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,300
...to have to work on the sparkle...

804
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,470
...for the rest of our lives.

805
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,970
Sparkle.

806
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,470
Got it.

807
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,400
Listen to that!

808
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:33,160
When it starts really screaming, the waves
stack up, and you've got these big, nasty--

809
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,280
You can, by unlocking
the power of natural juice...

810
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,490
...with Jack LaLanne's Power Juicer.

811
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,450
Change your life. Save your life.

812
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,660
You are the most important person
you have.

813
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,670
If you don't do it, who will?

814
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:49,340
Juicing is the easy way to help save
your life. And I guarantee it.

815
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,760
So don't delay. Drink yourself healthy.

816
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:55,140
Start enjoying the benefits of fresh,
all-natural juice.

817
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,800
Order your Jack LaLanne
Power Juicer now.

818
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,390
The last two years
weren't exactly the best time...

819
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,100
...to put an apartment on the market.

820
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,640
So we didn't.

821
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,560
And from time to time,
I'd come here to write.

822
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,560
Or to visit the clothes.

823
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,120
-Hello?
-What time did you wake up?

824
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:09,630
I don't know, about 6.

825
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:14,800
I'm worried about the Vogue article,
so I wanted to get started.

826
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,010
You haven't written over there in a while.

827
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,090
Yeah, I know. I know. I just--

828
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,760
I don't know, I thought it would be easier
to work here. No distractions.

829
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,430
-Okay.
-Anyway, it's due Thursday...

830
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,100
...and I'm not even sure
what I'm writing yet, so, um....

831
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,610
Maybe I should just stay here
until I get it done.

832
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,400
You're going to stay there?

833
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:35,940
Just two days.
You know, just to bang it out.

834
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,780
-Is that all right?
-Whatever you need.

835
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,660
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

836
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,330
No, I just feel like I really need
to lock myself in a room...

837
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:50,290
...and not think about anything
but writing.

838
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:51,840
Okay?

839
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,300
Okay.

840
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,720
-Just two days. Okay?
-Okay.

841
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,590
-Okay.
-Bye.

842
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,180
Bye.

843
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,890
And I did think about nothing but writing.

844
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,560
Until the next day, when I could think
about nothing but food.

845
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:11,230
And as long as I was going to break
to eat anyway, I thought:

846
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,810
"Why not call the girls?"

847
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,230
One week in Abu Dhabi,
all expenses paid.

848
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:19,650
I've always been fascinated by
the Middle East. You know, desert moons...

849
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,620
...Scheherazade, magic carpets.

850
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,000
-Like Jasmine in Aladdin?
-Yes, sweetie, just like Jasmine.

851
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,830
But with cocktails.

852
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:34,710
-It is exciting. When are you gonna go?
-I don't know. When can you all be free?

853
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:38,840
You didn't think I was going
without my gals.

854
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:41,340
-What?
-I told the sheikh I'd go on one condition:

855
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,010
I'd get to bring my three best girlfriends.

856
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,970
-Get out of town.
-My point exactly.

857
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,560
And we are being flown
on the sheikh's own airline.

858
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,520
-He has his own airline?
-Mm-hm.

859
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:55,520
- Oh, that is one chic sheikh.
- Super, super, super first class.

860
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:58,860
And you get your own individual suite
on the plane.

861
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:00,860
- Oh, my God.
- All expenses paid for...

862
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,950
...everything for all of us.
All we have to do is pick the week.

863
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,370
And the sooner, the better.
I can hear the decadence calling.

864
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:10,580
Let me just check my work schedule.
Yeah. All clear.

865
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,040
I gotta check with the old ball and chain,
but I'm good to go. Middle East me.

866
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:16,960
Charlotte, how's three weeks from now?

867
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:18,920
Oh, I don't know. I--

868
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,800
We have to go this month. Next month,
it gets so hot, you burst into flames.

869
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,220
I bet that's not on their website.

870
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,350
I mean, I don't know if I can go at all.

871
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,600
I have two children.

872
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,350
Yes, yes, but you have a husband.

873
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,060
And a full-time nanny. You said so yourself.
The kids love the nanny, right?

874
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:37,980
- Yes, but--
But what? What's the problem?

875
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,320
I mean, we haven't been
anywhere together...

876
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,240
...since Carrie and Big's wedding blowup
honeymoon disaster.

877
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,370
-Memories.
-And that was two years ago.

878
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:49,580
Two years of bad business
and this bullshit economy, and I'm done.

879
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,120
We need to go somewhere rich.

880
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,250
-Samantha, I appreciate the--
-No.

881
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,040
I go to children's birthday parties for you.

882
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,260
You are going to Abu Dhabi for me.

883
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,420
Children's birthday parties.

884
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:03,970
Pulling out the big guns.

885
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,100
-Okay.
-Thank you.

886
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,440
Look at us. Going to Abu Dhabi.

887
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,910
- Hello.
- How'd it go?

888
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,280
Just finished.
And thanks for the time.

889
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:33,120
How soon can you be dressed for dinner?
I have 9:00 reservations.

890
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,000
Well...

891
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,540
...it's 8:30 already.

892
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,710
I'm downstairs.

893
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,630
And just like that, it was 1998 again.

894
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,470
I'll be right down.

895
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,870
-Hey, kid.
-Hey.

896
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,530
I missed you.

897
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,120
I missed you.

898
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,460
We had a wonderful dinner out.

899
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:22,920
And back at home...

900
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:27,380
...the television stayed off
the entire night.

901
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:35,180
And pretty soon,
the Middle East was upon us.

902
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,640
I need that.

903
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,900
-Almost packed?
-One more to go.

904
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,530
I had an idea I wanted
to talk to you about.

905
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,070
Remember when you took those
two days away to finish your article...

906
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,160
-...and then we had that great night?
-Mm-hm.

907
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,580
Maybe we should think
about doing that every week.

908
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:57,370
Hear me out.

909
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:02,960
After you took those two days
at your old apartment, I started thinking:

910
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,550
What if I got a place?

911
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,130
-You want your own apartment?
-No, not my own apartment.

912
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,760
Just a place that I can go
two days a week...

913
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,560
...lie around, watch television,
do the shit I wanna do that bugs you.

914
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,230
And then the other five days...

915
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:22,230
...I'd be here and available
for dinners and sparkle or whatever.

916
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:27,400
So you're telling me that you want
two days off a week from our marriage.

917
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,450
And you'd have the same two days.

918
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,240
Oh, my God.

919
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:33,530
To work or see your friends.

920
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,540
Do the things you wanna do without me.

921
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,580
But I don't wanna do things without you.

922
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,370
Carrie, come on, I know you.

923
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,790
Can you honestly tell me you didn't enjoy
those two days to yourself?

924
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,470
Two days, yes,
but I don't need it every week.

925
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,840
Are you saying you need it every week?

926
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:56,260
I don't know, it was just an idea.
Something to think about.

927
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,810
Marriage doesn't work like that.

928
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,810
I thought we were supposed to be
making up our own rules.

929
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,240
So two days, then four days,
then what, no days?

930
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:18,080
-Is that where this is heading?
-I never would've brought it up if I thought...

931
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,460
...it was gonna make you think I want out.
Look, I knew two years ago:

932
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,630
I am exactly where I wanna be.

933
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,460
Five days a week.

934
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:29,210
Look, I'm just trying to make it
a little easier for us to live together.

935
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,840
I mean, we're married...

936
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,880
...but we're still us.

937
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,050
Is this because I'm a bitch wife
who nags you?

938
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,390
I feel like I'm disappointing you
all the time.

939
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:44,690
No, you're not disappointing me.

940
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:47,980
Well, something is.

941
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:58,490
So, what would I tell the girls?
"Big and I are taking two days a week off...

942
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,660
...to make our marriage work better"?
They'd never understand.

943
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,580
I don't care if they understand.

944
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,210
This is our marriage.

945
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,340
Me and you. Just like you said.

946
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,760
Carrie...

947
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,170
...we're adults without children.

948
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,180
We have the luxury to design our life.

949
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,560
Well, you can't get your own apartment.

950
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,230
That would freak me out
and it's a waste of money.

951
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:27,150
You can have my old place
two days a week.

952
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:33,450
Temporarily, till I figure out
how I feel about this.

953
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:38,070
And I can take it back any time.

954
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,080
Deal.

955
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:45,170
-There's the car.
-I'll get your bags.

956
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,710
Oh, yes, you will.

957
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,000
And in a week, I'll pick you up
at the airport and take you home.

958
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,130
Whose home, yours or mine?

959
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:55,720
Ours.

960
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,810
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

961
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,770
Ladies and gentlemen...

962
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:14,900
...we are pleased to welcome you onboard
our flight to Abu Dhabi International Airport.

963
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:17,410
-Nice.
-Hi.

964
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,910
Wow.

965
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,040
Welcome aboard Afdal Air.

966
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:29,920
Thank you.

967
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,250
Thank you. I love your hat.

968
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,170
Thank you.

969
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,340
And I thought mine
was gonna be too much.

970
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,590
Oh, my God.

971
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,140
-This is bigger than my first apartment.
-Hot towel?

972
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,010
And everything is so beautiful.

973
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,310
Just like I promised: the best of the best.

974
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:48,480
And look:

975
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,480
Arabic Pringles.

976
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,270
Okay, now I'm impressed.

977
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,900
- Date?
- Would you care for a date?

978
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:58,280
Not on vacation five minutes
and I already got a date.

979
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,950
Dates are the traditional welcome fruit
of the Middle East.

980
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,620
I read that in one of these.

981
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:08,620
-Oh. You moving there?
-I've got us covered. The dos and don'ts.

982
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:10,040
And speaking of don'ts...

983
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:13,000
...men and women do not embrace
in public in the Middle East.

984
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:16,090
Eh, eh, eh!
No, no, no. She's talking to you, sister.

985
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,380
Oh, please.
We're going to the new Middle East.

986
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:22,390
And when I need a break
from all the real information...

987
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:26,640
...I have this.

988
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:31,810
Let me see this.

989
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,990
Oh, listen. How exotic.
I wonder what she's saying.

990
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:42,660
Probably telling us not to bring
those magazines on a 13-hour plane ride...

991
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:46,660
-...with an impressionable woman.
-Charlotte, honey, don't read that.

992
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,870
Sorry.

993
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,670
You see,
it becomes a "Y" after a few drinks.

994
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,050
-I see.
-Care for another round, ladies?

995
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,930
It means "yes."

996
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,350
Yeah, not the best word for her to learn.

997
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,350
How many times are you gonna read that?

998
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:19,150
Big and I are thinking about taking
two days a week apart to do our own thing.

999
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,360
Is everything okay?

1000
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:23,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's just something we're talking about.

1001
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:26,870
You know, he would get two days off
to do his things...

1002
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,000
...and on those days,
I would do my things.

1003
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:33,000
You know, like write
or have dinner with you guys...

1004
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:35,710
...or I don't know, whatever.

1005
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,710
Love it. I'm available.

1006
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,880
Two days off?
You make marriage sound like a job.

1007
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,550
Well, it may not be a job, but it's work.

1008
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,140
Well, would that mean
that you would have two nights off too?

1009
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,720
Mm-hm.

1010
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:50,890
-Where would you sleep?
-Well, he's gonna stay at my old place...

1011
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,690
...and I'll stay at our new place.

1012
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,730
I loved that time when Steve and I
knew we were together...

1013
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,440
...but we still had our own places.
That was the best of both worlds.

1014
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:03,660
I just think marriage is two people...

1015
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,740
...night after night,
sleeping in the same bed.

1016
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:09,540
You have four people in your bed.

1017
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,410
I've had four people in my bed.

1018
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,670
No?

1019
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:17,210
Well, ladies...

1020
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:21,210
...I am going to slap on
a patch of melatonin...

1021
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,680
...and have a seven-star snooze.

1022
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,930
-I will see you in the Middle East.
-Night.

1023
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,640
It means "good night."

1024
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:36,020
I'm sorry.

1025
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:37,810
Explain it again.

1026
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,770
Just, what is it really about?

1027
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:46,610
Big and I are just trying
to make our own rules.

1028
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,620
You know, figure out what works best
for us as a couple...

1029
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,870
...not what society says should work
for us.

1030
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,290
Okay. God.

1031
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,540
Charlotte...

1032
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:57,960
...we're adults with no children.

1033
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:01,210
We have the luxury
to design our own life.

1034
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,970
But doesn't it hurt your feelings
that he would want time off?

1035
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,730
You just don't get it.

1036
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:27,490
Somewhere over Africa...

1037
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,990
...I began to wonder about relationships.

1038
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,580
Can we really ever expect anyone
on the outside...

1039
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,540
...to understand what goes on
between two other people?

1040
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,300
Eight time zones and a change
of clothes later, we arrived in the future.

1041
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:51,180
Have any of you ladies ever been
to the Middle East before?

1042
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:54,270
No, we're all virgins.

1043
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,190
Thank you.

1044
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,150
Super, super, super gentle.
Thank you, thank you.

1045
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,050
I am sorry, but...

1046
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,630
...do you have any drugs in your luggage?

1047
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,760
No. Just my hormones.

1048
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,720
You gotta be kidding me.

1049
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:38,810
I am sorry. It is just a UAE law.

1050
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,940
But they're all natural.
They're made from yams.

1051
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,610
Ladies, these are not drugs.

1052
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:50,530
Okay, I need to speak to an ambassador
or an embassy...

1053
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,570
...or someone in menopause.

1054
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,990
Samantha, please calm down.

1055
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,290
-This is getting very, very Midnight Express.
-Okay. Fine, take them.

1056
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:03,540
Without those creams and vitamins,
I will go ricocheting back into menopause.

1057
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:07,420
-Relax, it's one week.
-Tell that to the beard I'll be growing.

1058
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:10,800
We've set your meeting
with Sheikh Khalid for the end of your trip...

1059
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:13,260
...after you and your friends
have experienced...

1060
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:15,760
...the best of what Abu Dhabi has
to offer.

1061
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:17,600
Which starts right now.

1062
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,350
Yours for the entire trip.

1063
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,270
Four new Maybachs.

1064
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,440
Wow, do we need all four?

1065
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:29,030
It is already arranged.

1066
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,290
I'll be in my own private air conditioning.

1067
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,620
I will be departing from you here.
The hotel awaits your arrival.

1068
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:45,460
If you need me for anything,
please do not hesitate to ask.

1069
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:47,460
Could you help me check
and make sure...

1070
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:50,050
...that my iPhone
has the proper international code?

1071
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:55,890
I think that we can find someone
not so official to help with that.

1072
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:58,890
-He offered.
-Hey, what's the holdup?

1073
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,600
We got a lot of Abu Dhabi to do.

1074
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:04,310
Abu Dhabi do.

1075
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:07,060
Welcome to Abu Dhabi.

1076
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,980
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

1077
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,910
Oh, my God.

1078
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:03,290
Oh, Toto, I don't think
we're in Kansas anymore.

1079
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,250
Miss Jones?

1080
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,090
I am Mr. Safir, the hotel manager.

1081
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,800
-I trust your flight was pleasant?
-Like a magic carpet.

1082
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,220
-How charming. For you.
-Oh, thank you.

1083
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,050
-Please, for you.
-Thank you.

1084
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,100
Please-- Oh, thank you.

1085
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,430
This way, if you please, ladies.

1086
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,430
How do we tip in Abu Dhabi?

1087
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,480
Have you got any loose rubies?

1088
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:30,060
We have many wonderful things
planned for you at the hotel.

1089
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:34,990
- Oh. This is gorgeous.
- Thank you.

1090
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:38,240
And, please, some Arabic coffee.

1091
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:41,080
-Thank you.
-Made with rose water and cumin.

1092
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:43,620
That means "thank you."

1093
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,080
-You speak Arabic?
-Not yet.

1094
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:48,920
Well, you're off to a great start.

1095
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:53,840
It's different.

1096
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,420
Not your cup of tea.

1097
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,300
-What's with all the men?
-Thank you.

1098
01:06:57,470 --> 01:06:59,260
Oh, the World Cup trials are here.

1099
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:00,590
Wow.

1100
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,930
-Did they also bring their balls?
-Yes, they have many, many balls.

1101
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,430
This way please, for your private elevator.

1102
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,980
-We have a private elevator?
-Apparently.

1103
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,410
This can't be for us.

1104
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,160
We must not be in the right place.

1105
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:31,130
No, for once in my life,
I can say without a shadow of a doubt...

1106
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:34,630
...I am in the exact right place.

1107
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,840
Who ordered the cute?

1108
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:44,140
Welcome to the Jewel Suite.

1109
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,180
-Who is Miss Jones?
-I am.

1110
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:48,480
We are thrilled to welcome you
and your guests.

1111
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,560
- Thank you.
- Abdul will be your butler...

1112
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,270
-...Miss Jones.
-Mm.

1113
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,320
-Miss Bradshaw?
-Oh, that's me.

1114
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,150
-I am Gaurau. I will be here to serve you.
-Thank you.

1115
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,990
And Resir for Miss Hobbes.

1116
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:02,160
It's "Hobbes."

1117
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,870
I'm so very sorry.

1118
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,740
No, it's--

1119
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:07,910
It's not a big deal. It's fine.

1120
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,330
And Adman for Miss York.

1121
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,750
If you will, please, follow us.

1122
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:18,550
-We each get our own butler?
-Makes sense, we each get our own car.

1123
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,300
Rotunda. Miss York, this way, if you will.

1124
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,850
"York"? What happened to "Goldenblatt"?

1125
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:28,680
-It's the Middle East.
-It's the new Middle East.

1126
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:31,640
It's the Middle East.

1127
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,690
This is the den.
Complete with its own private bar.

1128
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:38,530
Ooh. Belly up, ladies.

1129
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:44,410
There is also a private kitchen
available for you day and night.

1130
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:47,030
Dream come true.

1131
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:51,460
In here,
you will find your informal lounge.

1132
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,290
Through there, the double boudoir.

1133
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,500
-Roomies.
-Roomies.

1134
01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:00,880
And in here, the formal salon.

1135
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,560
And, ladies, out on the terrace...

1136
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,440
...you have an overview
of the entire grounds.

1137
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:21,240
There's also a bar pool,
five international restaurants, a spa...

1138
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,110
...a fitness center, a nightclub...

1139
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,740
...and, of course,
the beach and beach clubs.

1140
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:29,950
I've taken the liberty of arranging massages
for you, followed by an early dinner.

1141
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,290
Then you can have a good night's rest
and wake up tomorrow fresh.

1142
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,790
There's nothing I don't love
about everything you just said.

1143
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:41,420
Here is Abdul with drinks.
If there is anything you need...

1144
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,840
...please do not hesitate to ask.
We are at your service.

1145
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,450
The robes are called abayas...

1146
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:11,490
...and the veil that covers everything
except the eyes is a niqab.

1147
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,620
Certainly cuts back on the Botox bill.

1148
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:20,790
"Women are required to dress in a way
that does not attract sexual attention."

1149
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,470
Samantha, you gotta....

1150
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:27,550
We're at the hotel. It's a free zone.

1151
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,640
Still. Out of respect.

1152
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:36,140
Well, I gotta say, I am digging the sequin
trim on the Real Housewife of Abu Dhabi.

1153
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,810
What's up with that?

1154
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:42,650
Younger Muslim women are embracing
old traditions in new and personal ways.

1155
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:45,740
Well, I could get into the head wrap...

1156
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,820
...but the veil across the mouth,
it freaks me out.

1157
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,490
It's like they don't want them
to have a voice.

1158
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:53,990
Yeah, or hormones.

1159
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:57,870
I cannot find one Internet hormone site
that's not blocked.

1160
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,000
At least you know your phone is working.

1161
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:03,550
I can't get Harry to respond
to any of my texts and it's not like him.

1162
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:08,010
-But you called him when you arrived, right?
-Yeah, but that was hours ago.

1163
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,560
French fries for the lady with the veil.

1164
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,520
How is she gonna do that?

1165
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,070
A lift for every fry.

1166
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:25,360
That is a major commitment
to fried food.

1167
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:28,110
What time is it in New York now?

1168
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,700
Okay. Sweetie, you gotta stop.

1169
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,700
-What do you mean?
-You are obsessing...

1170
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:36,700
...about something
that is happening 6700 miles away...

1171
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:40,790
...and you're missing the woman with
the veil eating french fries at the next table.

1172
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,630
Consider this an interfriendtion.

1173
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,420
You have to stop obsessing
about the nanny.

1174
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:49,550
Well, it is all Samantha's fault.

1175
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:53,220
I was perfectly happy and then she went
and opened her big mouth.

1176
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:55,180
Maybe we should get her a niqab.

1177
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:57,770
Look, I warn you right now,
don't come down on me.

1178
01:11:57,930 --> 01:11:59,730
With the jet lag
and the no hormones...

1179
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:03,020
...who knows what kind
of mood swings I'm capable of.

1180
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,070
I like the necklace.

1181
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,070
Hi.

1182
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,290
-Miss?
-Ah!

1183
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,210
Oh, God.

1184
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:08,500
I'm so very sorry.

1185
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:12,510
It's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't--

1186
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,140
I didn't expect you to still be here.

1187
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,800
You did not dismiss me.

1188
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:20,180
Oh. I was supposed to do that?

1189
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,640
Oh.

1190
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:24,480
I'm sorry, Gaurau, I didn't know.

1191
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,520
It is my pleasure. What can I do for you?

1192
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:31,110
Nothing, I was just gonna warm
some milk up, but you go, go home.

1193
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,360
No, no, allow me, please. I insist.

1194
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:36,870
I will bring it to you.

1195
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:38,990
Oh, you don't have to. I'll wait.

1196
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:52,880
If you will permit me,
might I suggest a touch of cinnamon?

1197
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,550
It is a secret learned from my wife.

1198
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:01,220
Well, please apologize to your wife
for my keeping you here all night.

1199
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:03,520
It is fine. She is in India.

1200
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:05,390
Oh.

1201
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,980
I will see her in one month.

1202
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:10,690
I'm afraid if I apologize then,
it will hardly make sense.

1203
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:16,030
So you work here
and you travel back and forth?

1204
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:21,620
Yes. Every three months, when I have a
break in work and can afford the plane fare.

1205
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:25,870
Isn’t that hard?

1206
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,210
What, miss?

1207
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:32,630
Just, you know, being married
and spending all that time apart.

1208
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,180
Time does not matter.

1209
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:40,890
When we see each other, each time...

1210
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,640
...it is very wonderful.

1211
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:47,060
I'm a lucky man.

1212
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:56,780
Okay, now I'm gonna try
one of these little date confections.

1213
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,620
I think my butler's gay.

1214
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:09,500
-First, he's way too cute.
-That's genetics.

1215
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:12,590
I asked about his dating life
and he said it was private.

1216
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,130
That's appropriate.

1217
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:17,260
When I asked how to pronounce
his name he said:

1218
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,760
"Abdul. Like Paula."

1219
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:22,970
-And that's gay.
-Yeah.

1220
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:25,100
- Morning.
- Morning.

1221
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,930
-Morning.
-How'd you sleep?

1222
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,940
All right.

1223
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:32,770
-Samantha, what are you eating?
-Mm. Hummus.

1224
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,440
I read online that chickpeas are high
in natural estrogen.

1225
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:40,450
So are yams.
Paula Abdul's getting me some later.

1226
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,200
Is she here too?

1227
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:48,120
Good morning, miss.
What can we bring you for breakfast?

1228
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,120
Just some fruit, please.

1229
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:52,040
Thank you.

1230
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:55,170
He is so nice. What's his name again?

1231
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:56,710
Gaurau.

1232
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,470
He's from India.
His wife still lives there.

1233
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,970
They only see each other once
every three months when they can afford it.

1234
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:08,310
And I asked him if that was hard
for them and he said:

1235
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,100
"Time doesn't matter."

1236
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:14,150
That each time they see each other
it's wonderful.

1237
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:17,820
So, see, there are all kinds
of marriages.

1238
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,910
Who's up for a morning trip
to the souk in Old Abu Dhabi?

1239
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,120
What's a souk?

1240
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:33,380
It's a market where you can buy
gold, spices...

1241
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:35,500
...textiles and souk things.

1242
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:38,170
I'm in. One sip then souk.

1243
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:43,090
Wow.

1244
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:47,010
-Oh, it's so beautiful.
-We'll be back in time for lunch.

1245
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,060
- Thank you, Gaurau.
- Thank you, Resir.

1246
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:52,020
Got it.

1247
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,780
You must not have
a forbidden experience.

1248
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,530
Oh, okay.

1249
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,070
Men may approach you
with black-market wristwatches.

1250
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:09,370
If you engage them, they'll move you to a
room and try to sell you items. It is illegal.

1251
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:13,500
Other than that, you'll not have to worry.
People here are very honest.

1252
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,710
Driver.

1253
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:00,000
Mm. Smells so good.
- Yeah.

1254
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,760
Ladies.

1255
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:10,100
-Forbidden experience coming at you.
-Ladies. Ladies.

1256
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:11,600
-No, no.
-Ladies.

1257
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:14,430
No.

1258
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,600
Oh.

1259
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:20,020
And from the forbidden to the necessary.

1260
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,610
I'll be going there.

1261
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:25,820
Of course you will. I'm going back
for more spices. I don't think I got enough.

1262
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:27,660
Okay.

1263
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:36,960
These are very pretty.

1264
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:38,170
Do you speak English?

1265
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:40,130
Yes.

1266
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:48,140
May I try this? Thank you.

1267
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,560
Let me just get them....

1268
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:55,350
Oh, thank you.

1269
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,770
So, yes, yes.

1270
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,820
I'll take them.

1271
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:05,860
Thank you.

1272
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,820
So pretty.

1273
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:14,040
Just....

1274
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,080
Thank you.

1275
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,710
So, for this, how much?

1276
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,670
One hundred dirham.

1277
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,170
-Twenty dollars?
-Yes.

1278
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:28,680
-For shoes?
-Yes.

1279
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,970
Okay, thank you.

1280
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,980
That's 100. Thank you.

1281
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:40,650
Oh, you know what,
I'll just put the shoes in my purse.

1282
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:43,650
Okay. I'm just gonna make room.

1283
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:54,240
Is that the call to prayer?

1284
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:56,370
Yes.

1285
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:16,600
And there, in the middle of Old Abu Dhabi,
was an old love.

1286
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,770
-The guy hid them back there--
-Aidan.

1287
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:50,340
This is the best mirage that I've ever had.

1288
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,180
And I did some peyote once in Arizona
that blew my head off.

1289
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,060
Come here, you.

1290
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:01,940
Is this allowed here?

1291
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:04,440
What the--?

1292
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,860
Abu Dhabi? What? You? Why?

1293
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:13,660
Well, I heard
about this amazing deal on shoes.

1294
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:17,120
No, I'm here with the girls.

1295
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:20,950
Yeah, Samantha worked us all in
on her free PR trip.

1296
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,290
And you? What...?

1297
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:27,590
I'm on the third leg of a buying trip.
Bali, India, here.

1298
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:30,010
Yeah, I import rugs to sell
with the furniture...

1299
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:33,220
...and I'm talking like I don't know you.
Come here again.

1300
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,300
Holy moly.

1301
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:46,810
You know,
Miranda's here with me, so, I don't--

1302
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:50,690
Shall we grab a kebab or a whatever?

1303
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:55,570
Shoot. I have to eat lunch
with my business partners.

1304
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:01,750
And they don't cotton to the ladies
at the lunches.

1305
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:04,370
I knew I should've packed my burqa.

1306
01:22:05,210 --> 01:22:08,290
We're going to a different city after lunch.
I'll be back tomorrow.

1307
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,750
Can I take you out to dinner,
just you and me?

1308
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,760
Oh. Uh....

1309
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,380
Well, I don't really know
what the girls have planned.

1310
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:17,840
You know,
Miranda's got us scheduled pretty....

1311
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:21,180
It's okay. Look, if you have the time...

1312
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,810
...the locals say that the restaurant at
my hotel has the best muhammara in town.

1313
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,850
That's my international cell.

1314
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,360
International cell.

1315
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,030
Look at you, all grown-up.

1316
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,200
I should get going.

1317
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,410
They consider it rude
to keep people waiting here.

1318
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,450
Bye.

1319
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:50,250
They also consider it rude
not to call an old boyfriend for dinner.

1320
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:57,300
Carrie!

1321
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,550
How weird is this?

1322
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:04,220
How did he look?

1323
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:07,100
Like no time had gone by.

1324
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,310
- Did you tell him you and Big got married?
- Yes.

1325
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,440
Those were the first words
out of my mouth.

1326
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:15,400
"Hey, we're here in Abu Dhabi
and I married that man you hated."

1327
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:19,410
-Is he still married?
-I have no idea.

1328
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:21,200
Was he wearing a wedding ring?

1329
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:22,740
I believe he was.

1330
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:27,160
-Are you gonna have dinner with him?
-We're here to spend time together.

1331
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:29,750
- Just the four of us.
- Right.

1332
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:34,500
-Um, legs.
-Miranda, I'm at the pool.

1333
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:37,590
-What am I supposed to wear?
-How about a burkini?

1334
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,760
Yeah, they have them at the gift shop.

1335
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:43,430
Forget about them.

1336
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,770
Look.

1337
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:49,770
Arriving at the pool,
direct from a sweaty practice match:

1338
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:51,600
The Australian rugby team.

1339
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,320
Who ordered the Aussie sausage?

1340
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:11,460
This is a disaster.

1341
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:14,710
I have a whole pool of testosterone
from down under...

1342
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,050
...and I'm not feeling anything
down under.

1343
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,630
It's official.
The estrogen has left the building.

1344
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,300
Okay, I am pulling an interfriendtion.

1345
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:26,350
If I can't talk anymore about Harry...

1346
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,810
...then she can't talk anymore
about hormones.

1347
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:32,850
I can't eat any more yams.

1348
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:34,230
Couldn't hurt.

1349
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:38,070
Ladies, we came here
to have fun together.

1350
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,740
And I, being the type-A
control freak that I am...

1351
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:45,490
...have planned a full day and night
of big Abu Dhabi fun.

1352
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:47,870
I am gonna turn this interfriendtion...

1353
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,000
...into an interfuntion.

1354
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:58,210
Still nothing.

1355
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:44,470
Thank you.

1356
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,930
Thank you, Gaurau.

1357
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,390
-Oh, my.
-You said we were going to lunch.

1358
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,560
We are. Camels, then lunch. It'll be fun.

1359
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:59,480
Not to not be fun...

1360
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:02,740
...but I'm not really dressed
to get on a camel.

1361
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:03,900
I've got that covered.

1362
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,830
-What?
-Gift of the hotel.

1363
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:12,250
And don't worry,
I had Abdul pick them out.

1364
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,250
Serious?

1365
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,460
-Care to change in the Bedouin tent?
-Bedouin, Bath and Beyond.

1366
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:22,630
Still nothing.

1367
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,260
Thank you, Gaurau, yes.

1368
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:28,300
- This is very exciting suddenly.
- Help. Wait, wait. Help.

1369
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:30,600
Heels. Sand. Hot.

1370
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,990
-I'm having a hot flash.
-You're fine.

1371
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,040
Seriously, they're starting.

1372
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:38,620
Look, you're on a camel
in the middle of the desert.

1373
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:40,880
If you're not having a hot flash,
you're dead.

1374
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,420
-What do you think?
-This is fabulous.

1375
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,420
There's my phone. Oh, my God.
It's my phone.

1376
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:48,510
Who's her long distance provider?

1377
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,350
Hello, Harry? What have you been doing?

1378
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:56,060
I woke you up? Harry, wait.
You're going in and out.

1379
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,230
Can you hear me now?

1380
01:27:58,600 --> 01:27:59,730
Harry?

1381
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,190
Miranda, I'm falling!

1382
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:03,770
Sir, she's falling!

1383
01:28:04,690 --> 01:28:06,440
Are you okay?

1384
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:07,860
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

1385
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:09,280
Are you all right?

1386
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,410
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1387
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,450
Oh.

1388
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:17,870
Wow, you have an actual
camel camel-toe.

1389
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:23,080
Oh, it's not that funny.

1390
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:25,210
She's having a little sand wedge.

1391
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,880
Harry? Hi!

1392
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:32,430
Harry, are you there?
I just fell off a camel.

1393
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:33,850
Thank you, sir.

1394
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:35,890
Did you get my texts?

1395
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:42,060
It is amazing how much food and clothing
four butlers can fit into four Maybachs.

1396
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:44,230
-Thanks.
-Enjoy.

1397
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,570
Gorgeous.

1398
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:50,740
To Fouad and Marzouk and--

1399
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,910
-Hatimi.
-Hatimi.

1400
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:54,070
-Yes.
-Thank you.

1401
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:11,510
My apologies, ladies,
for disturbing your fun.

1402
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:16,140
Gaurau, my friend, if you would do me
the kindness of calling the hotel...

1403
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:19,520
...telling them I'll be an hour or two late.

1404
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,390
My pleasure, sir.

1405
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,690
What's the sense
in a boring business dinner...

1406
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:26,110
...when you have sand dunes
and sunset?

1407
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,520
Am I right?

1408
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:54,720
You all saw that, right?

1409
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:55,970
Well, I sure did.

1410
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:57,970
Who's Lawrence of Arabia?

1411
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:01,640
He's a Danish architect who stays
at the hotel each time he's in Abu Dhabi.

1412
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:04,810
-Very nice man.
-Very hot man.

1413
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:09,400
Well, ladies, I am definitely feeling
something down under.

1414
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,990
- No, don't, don't.
- And he's staying at our hotel.

1415
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:16,490
Lawrence of my labia.

1416
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:30,090
It feels like the first time

1417
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:34,630
It feels like the very first time

1418
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,010
It feels like the first time

1419
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:42,680
It feels like the very first time

1420
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:52,570
Karaoke in the U.S., tired.

1421
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:55,700
Karaoke in the Middle East, fresh.

1422
01:30:56,280 --> 01:31:00,780
Now, why are those women allowed
to show their bellies and chests?

1423
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:05,200
Well, from my research, there's some
kind of nightclub-belly-dancer loophole.

1424
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:09,210
Oh, those clever religious men.

1425
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:12,300
Oh, excuse me. I mean, marhaba.

1426
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:20,050
Okay. Could we get another round
of champagne?

1427
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,260
-Okay.
-Okay.

1428
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:22,810
Shukran very much.

1429
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:26,060
Another round?
You are fun in Abu Dhabi.

1430
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:28,480
-I'm fun in New York.
-Not for the last two years.

1431
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:32,320
Oh, really?
You think I'm fun now? Just wait.

1432
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:36,650
It feels like the very first time

1433
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:38,240
Give it up, people.

1434
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:42,580
Give it up, Abu Dhabi.
He's working hard, hard, hard for you.

1435
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:46,750
Next we have four girls from America.

1436
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,420
Ladies, you have to come
to the stage now, please, oh.

1437
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:54,800
-Put your hands together. Let's go.
-It'll be fun. It'll be fun. Come on, come on.

1438
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,630
We are waiting for you, America.

1439
01:31:57,670 --> 01:31:59,880
What song did you pick?
What if I don't know it?

1440
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:02,930
-Trust me, you know the song.
-Are those ours?

1441
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,520
They're going to sing for us.

1442
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,600
I am w--

1443
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:14,520
-No, no, no. Not yet.
-Wait for it.

1444
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:16,230
Now. Now we come in.

1445
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,610
I am woman, hear me roar

1446
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:21,780
In numbers too big to ignore

1447
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:27,370
And I know too much
To go back and pretend

1448
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:30,120
'Cause I've heard it all before

1449
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:33,130
And I've been down there on that floor

1450
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:38,420
And no one's ever gonna
Keep me down again

1451
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:42,050
No
Yes, I am wise

1452
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:45,140
But it's wisdom born of pain

1453
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,520
Yes, I paid the price

1454
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,980
But look how much I've gained

1455
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:55,480
If I have to
I can do anything

1456
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:58,150
I am strong
Strong

1457
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,820
I am invincible
Invincible

1458
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:06,030
I am woman

1459
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:09,330
-Pretty good, huh?
-Yeah.

1460
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,120
Everyone!

1461
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,250
Standing toe to toe

1462
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:21,050
As I spread my loving arms
Across the land

1463
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:24,340
I am still an embryo

1464
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:26,850
With a long, long way to go

1465
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:32,350
Until I make my brother understand

1466
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,150
Oh, yes
I am wise

1467
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:37,900
But it's wisdom born of pain

1468
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:40,690
Yes, I've paid the price

1469
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,950
But look how much I've gained

1470
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:49,200
If I have to
I can do anything

1471
01:33:49,370 --> 01:33:51,910
I am strong
Strong

1472
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,920
I am invincible
Invincible

1473
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,290
I am strong
Strong

1474
01:33:57,460 --> 01:34:00,590
I am invincible
Invincible

1475
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:06,090
I am woman

1476
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:15,100
Those are the American women.
I heard them roar.

1477
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:16,940
Oh, my goodness.

1478
01:34:18,770 --> 01:34:23,400
I am a woman

1479
01:34:24,490 --> 01:34:28,490
I got that table

1480
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:45,300
-That was quite a performance.
-Oh, you haven't seen anything yet.

1481
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:48,260
Hello again.
- Hi.

1482
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:51,930
Allow me to properly introduce myself.
My name is Rikard Spirt.

1483
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,270
Rikard. Isn’t that "Richard"?

1484
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:57,940
-In Danish, yes.
-So your name is Dick Spirt?

1485
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:02,530
Could you be any more American?

1486
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:03,980
I don't think so.

1487
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:08,660
Care to join me for a drink?

1488
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:12,450
Oh, I can't tonight. It's girls' night out.

1489
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:14,830
But I do have tomorrow free...

1490
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
...all day and night.

1491
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:20,500
Perhaps you'd be open for a late dinner.

1492
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,050
I'd be open.

1493
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:27,380
You're very funny...

1494
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:29,550
...Samantha.

1495
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:32,390
-Ladies.
-Good night.

1496
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:35,810
Wow.

1497
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:37,690
I gotta hand it to you, Samantha.

1498
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:41,440
Not blowing us off for a guy
in your condition...

1499
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:43,020
...very classy.

1500
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:45,780
Well, we made a deal ages ago.

1501
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:48,780
Men, babies, doesn't matter.

1502
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:50,200
We're soul mates.

1503
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:56,450
It was the perfect end to a perfect day.

1504
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:06,340
-Good morning.
-Good morning, miss.

1505
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:09,510
-Where is everyone?
-Oh, they're having breakfast on the terrace.

1506
01:36:14,890 --> 01:36:16,600
Is this Samantha's? May I?

1507
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:18,020
As you wish.

1508
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:19,390
Thanks.

1509
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:36,040
"And on and on, one by one, she
lampoons the traditional wedding vows."

1510
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,580
Yeah. It's a satire.

1511
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:38,910
And it's hilarious.

1512
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:45,460
"Until the talented Bradshaw is better able
to grasp the complexities of married life...

1513
01:36:46,090 --> 01:36:48,050
...she would be better advised...

1514
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:51,380
...to explore the vow of silence."

1515
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:52,550
Ugh!

1516
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:55,050
And he would be better advised
to go fuck himself.

1517
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:56,760
God.

1518
01:36:56,930 --> 01:36:59,020
The New Yorker.

1519
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:03,770
I have been carrying it around
in my purse for 20 years.

1520
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:07,270
And to make it worse,
they turned me into a cartoon...

1521
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,610
...and slapped tape across my mouth.

1522
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:10,900
Take it as a compliment.

1523
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:14,490
You have a strong female voice
and this guy is intimidated.

1524
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:19,790
You know, I'm just realizing, it wasn't
my tone of voice that my boss didn't like.

1525
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,910
It was the fact that I had a voice.

1526
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:25,380
Men in the U.S. pretend they're comfortable
with strong women...

1527
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:29,340
...but really, a lot of them would prefer us
eating french fries behind our veils.

1528
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:31,550
-Word.
-I should've just stuck to writing...

1529
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:34,010
...about what I know: Being single.

1530
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:35,510
But you're not.

1531
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:37,680
No, I'm married,
and Big wants two days off.

1532
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:39,680
-I thought you both wanted--
-Charlotte.

1533
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:44,100
Well, there'll be other reviews.
Fabulous reviews.

1534
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:47,310
No. But right now,
I need you to go shopping.

1535
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:49,860
We have to find me something
for my date.

1536
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:53,490
Something sexy that doesn't show
my tits, arms or belly.

1537
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:57,120
-I think I'm gonna take a walk.
-What about our spa day?

1538
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:00,200
I'm not in the mood. Not in the mood.
But you guys go, have fun.

1539
01:38:00,370 --> 01:38:02,120
Okay, I'll see you later.

1540
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:05,540
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1541
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:09,130
-We have dinner reservations at 8.
-Yeah.

1542
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:15,050
Miss?

1543
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:17,140
I'm going out.

1544
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:22,520
I don't know how she got ahold of it.

1545
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:24,810
No more yams.

1546
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:39,660
Is there anything you'd like to do, miss?

1547
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:41,830
No, thank you.

1548
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:47,080
I think I'm gonna walk ahead, by myself.

1549
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:56,430
I walked along the Abu Dhabi beach.

1550
01:38:57,180 --> 01:39:00,930
I had never felt so far away from home.

1551
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,600
Or from myself.

1552
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,220
-Hi.
-Hi.

1553
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:46,430
We missed you at the spa.
How was your day?

1554
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:49,060
-It was good.
-Wow, you look great.

1555
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:51,560
I'm meeting Aidan for dinner.

1556
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:55,360
Oh, okay.
We'll change our reservation to 5, then.

1557
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:58,150
No, we're okay with four.
Samantha's got that late date.

1558
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,240
Not necessary,
because we're having dinner at his hotel.

1559
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:02,990
At his hotel.

1560
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:05,790
Yeah. There's a great Middle Eastern
place there.

1561
01:40:05,950 --> 01:40:09,750
It has the best, I don't know, something.

1562
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:13,920
-Why are you having dinner with him?
-How can I not have dinner with him?

1563
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:17,260
We bump into each other
halfway around the world?

1564
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:20,260
-I mean, it means something.
-It doesn't mean anything.

1565
01:40:21,510 --> 01:40:22,760
Are you serious?

1566
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:27,430
You have been saying that everything
means something for the last 20 years.

1567
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:31,940
But seeing Aidan at a spice souk
in the Middle East means nothing.

1568
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:35,690
I think you're playing with fire.

1569
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:40,110
Oh, my God. Now I'm playing with fire?
All right, you've gone crazy.

1570
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:43,530
Seriously, you're crazy in Abu Dhabi.

1571
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:47,870
Just because you're worried about
your marriage, everyone's gonna cheat.

1572
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,370
Have a good time at dinner.

1573
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,540
You okay?

1574
01:40:54,710 --> 01:40:58,170
Yeah. I'm just really, really tired.
I'm gonna take a nap.

1575
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:00,130
Take a nice, long nap.

1576
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:03,180
And then I'll buy you a drink.
How's 9 sound?

1577
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:05,800
-Okay.
-Okay.

1578
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:24,280
Hi.

1579
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:27,580
Hi.

1580
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:33,000
Miss Hobbes.

1581
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:36,840
I thought,
"Why go to a bar when we have a bar?"

1582
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:39,380
Thank you.

1583
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,510
Thank you, Resir. You can go.

1584
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:45,390
How was your nap?

1585
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:46,680
I slept hard.

1586
01:41:46,850 --> 01:41:50,180
You needed it.
Being a mother kicks your ass.

1587
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:53,520
Yes, but the benefits make it worth it.

1588
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:58,940
Okay.

1589
01:42:00,690 --> 01:42:04,780
-We're 6700 miles away from everyone.
-Mm-hm.

1590
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:08,240
-You can say it to me. I'm a mother too.
-Say what?

1591
01:42:08,410 --> 01:42:12,620
All the things you're thinking, but you
won't allow yourself to say out loud.

1592
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:15,210
Okay. I'll go first.

1593
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,340
As much as I love Brady...

1594
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:24,090
...and I do love him more than words...

1595
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,470
...being a mother is not enough.

1596
01:42:29,930 --> 01:42:31,220
I miss my job.

1597
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:39,230
You're not gonna leave me hanging out
feeling like the worst mother, are you?

1598
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,070
Okay.

1599
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:46,030
Well....

1600
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:50,530
-I love my girls.
-I know that.

1601
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,120
But...

1602
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:56,670
...I have enjoyed not having them around.

1603
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,500
-I needed a break.
-Yes, you did.

1604
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:05,300
Rose cries all day, every day.

1605
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:07,130
It's driving me crazy.

1606
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:10,100
I have been watching you.
I don't know how you're doing it.

1607
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:13,600
Sometimes I go in the other room
and I close the door...

1608
01:43:13,770 --> 01:43:16,100
...and I just let her scream.
Isn’t that awful?

1609
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:18,520
No, that's survival. Take a sip.

1610
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,440
And can I tell you something else?

1611
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:25,690
I feel guilty.

1612
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:29,700
I feel so guilty, because all I ever prayed
for was to have a family.

1613
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:32,450
And now I have these two beautiful girls.

1614
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:33,790
And?

1615
01:43:33,950 --> 01:43:37,790
-They're driving me crazy.
-Take a sip.

1616
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,630
And I feel like I'm failing.

1617
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,840
I just feel like I'm failing all the time.

1618
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:47,130
You're not failing.

1619
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:49,130
Being a mother is hard.

1620
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:51,390
Oh, my God. It is so hard.

1621
01:43:51,930 --> 01:43:53,970
And I have full-time help.

1622
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:56,980
How do the women without help do it?

1623
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:59,900
I have no fucking idea.

1624
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,310
-To them.
-To them.

1625
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:06,650
And when I--

1626
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:09,200
Oh, no, I can't. I can't. It's awful.

1627
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:10,490
Sip.

1628
01:44:13,410 --> 01:44:14,950
Go.

1629
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:18,910
When I heard Samantha say...

1630
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:22,040
...that Harry was gonna cheat on me
with Erin--

1631
01:44:22,210 --> 01:44:23,750
Yeah.

1632
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:27,260
--my first thought was:

1633
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,760
"I can't lose the nanny."

1634
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:39,640
We really should eat something.

1635
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:48,190
I'm happy for you. For both of you.

1636
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:50,780
Thank you.

1637
01:44:51,450 --> 01:44:52,570
That means a lot.

1638
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:57,370
I have a confession to make.

1639
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,580
I already knew you were married.

1640
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:02,960
You let me go through all that?

1641
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:07,250
Yeah, my wife showed me something
on the internet.

1642
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:11,970
You know, she always kind of kept
one eye on you, the one that got away.

1643
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:22,310
How is Kathy?

1644
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:26,400
She's great. She's really amazing.

1645
01:45:27,610 --> 01:45:31,070
Her fabric business is through the roof,
even with the three boys.

1646
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:34,280
-Oh, my God. Three?
-Yeah.

1647
01:45:34,450 --> 01:45:36,410
Homer, Wyatt and Tate.

1648
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:38,410
Sounds like a country-music band.

1649
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:40,580
Here's hoping.

1650
01:45:45,790 --> 01:45:47,630
Tate.

1651
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:52,970
Wow. Aidan, they're amazing.

1652
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:55,390
Yeah, they're good boys.

1653
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:57,510
We're really lucky.

1654
01:46:00,390 --> 01:46:02,100
What about you?

1655
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:03,440
Not in the cards?

1656
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,230
I don't know.

1657
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:09,270
We've talked about it a lot
and both love kids, but...

1658
01:46:12,030 --> 01:46:13,780
...that's not who we are.

1659
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:17,450
Yeah, doesn't surprise me.
You're anything but traditional.

1660
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:20,120
I learned that when I tried
to get you to wear a ring.

1661
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:22,620
Exactly. And see? Still:

1662
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:26,040
No diamond.

1663
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:28,500
-And I'm married.
-Man...

1664
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:31,710
...that was my big mistake.
Trying to get a rock on you.

1665
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:36,470
You're not like other women.

1666
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:41,640
Man, are you not.

1667
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:48,650
Fuck, you look good.

1668
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:53,320
You look hot. I'm sorry, but you do.

1669
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,070
Did you enjoy...

1670
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:00,700
...the muhammara?

1671
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:05,080
That is the best muhammara
I've ever had.

1672
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:09,170
There's seven arches.

1673
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:13,210
One to represent each
of the different Arab Emirates.

1674
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:17,340
I memorize a different state
every time I come. I'm up to four now.

1675
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:19,890
I got Abu Dhabi, Ajman...

1676
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:23,520
...Dubai and, um, hold on....

1677
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:41,030
I'm sorry.

1678
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:43,080
No, I'm sorry.

1679
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:46,200
-Oh, fuck.
-Yeah, I should go.

1680
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:47,750
I'm going. Bye.

1681
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:52,880
Is this the way?

1682
01:48:09,190 --> 01:48:11,440
-How was your dinner, miss?
-Yeah.

1683
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:15,980
-I kissed Aidan.
-I knew it.

1684
01:48:16,150 --> 01:48:17,900
I know you knew it.

1685
01:48:18,070 --> 01:48:19,400
I played with fire.

1686
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:23,450
I'm so mad at myself.
Is Samantha still here? I need everybody.

1687
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:25,910
She's getting ready for her date.

1688
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:31,420
Samantha!

1689
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:34,000
In here.

1690
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,050
I kissed Aidan.
I'm freaking out. I need to talk.

1691
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:40,680
I'm coming right out.

1692
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:44,100
Paula, I need a towel.

1693
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:49,940
One minute, he was naming
the Arab Emirates...

1694
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:52,810
...and then, all of a sudden, we kissed.

1695
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:57,110
-Did he kiss you? Or did you kiss him?
-No, both. Both equally guilty.

1696
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:03,620
-Yeah, I wanna call Big and tell him.
-Let's just calm down for a second.

1697
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:07,540
No, really. I don't want the secret.
The secret to me makes it much worse.

1698
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:11,500
So the sooner I tell him, the quicker,
the less damage it will do.

1699
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:14,790
I mean, we're eight hours ahead
of New York. This is the future.

1700
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,460
It hasn't really even happened there yet.

1701
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:22,130
Well, now I'm crazy in Abu Dhabi.

1702
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:24,970
So, what do you think? Should I call him?

1703
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:26,810
I don't know.

1704
01:49:26,970 --> 01:49:29,060
I don't know.

1705
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,810
I don't know.

1706
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:34,400
I'm a little drunk.

1707
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:38,190
When Steve told me he cheated on me,
I was devastated.

1708
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:41,320
But now that I know
it was only that one time

1709
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:44,280
-Yeah?
-Was the pain worth it?

1710
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:47,490
-I don't know.
-Yeah. I don't know.

1711
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:49,370
Let's get something straight here.

1712
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:51,000
Steve had sex.

1713
01:49:51,330 --> 01:49:52,830
I'm sorry, but he did.

1714
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,670
And this was just a kiss.
A kiss is nothing.

1715
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,090
-A kiss with Aidan.
-It was a kiss.

1716
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:00,670
-We have a history.
-It was just a kiss.

1717
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:02,670
Say nothing.

1718
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:04,380
I am gonna tell him.

1719
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:08,890
Do me a favor...

1720
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:11,310
...and sleep on it.

1721
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:25,860
Your first sheesha experience.

1722
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:28,950
This is very exciting.

1723
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,870
You put this pipe in your mouth

1724
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:34,210
And suck?

1725
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:42,130
You are a natural.

1726
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:59,110
I think you have another audience.

1727
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:08,570
Abu Dhabi is so cutting-edge
in so many ways...

1728
01:51:08,740 --> 01:51:10,990
...and so backward when it comes to sex.

1729
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:13,240
And the paradox is...

1730
01:51:13,410 --> 01:51:18,000
...I find myself to be most aroused
on my trips here.

1731
01:51:18,170 --> 01:51:19,920
Do tell.

1732
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:26,930
If we were in, say, Paris,
or Madrid, right now...

1733
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:35,270
...I would be having my hand down
your blouse, brushing your nipples.

1734
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:39,980
But here, such things are forbidden.

1735
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:43,440
And it's like being a boy again.

1736
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,780
And are you a big boy?

1737
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:00,540
Walk on the beach?

1738
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,460
Oh, yes.

1739
01:52:02,630 --> 01:52:05,130
I need a walk on the beach.

1740
01:52:20,650 --> 01:52:23,520
Your top seems to have come undone.

1741
01:52:58,020 --> 01:53:01,350
Well, it's 2:30 a.m. there.
You still can't be jet-lagged.

1742
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,400
Hi.

1743
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:05,520
Something happened.

1744
01:53:06,030 --> 01:53:08,030
-Are you okay?
-Yes. Yes.

1745
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:12,780
Nothing accident-wise or anything.

1746
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:14,700
But it was an accident.

1747
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:17,490
What happened? Are you physically okay?

1748
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:19,580
Yes, I'm--

1749
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:22,170
I'm fine.

1750
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:28,510
I, uh, went to the spice market...

1751
01:53:28,670 --> 01:53:30,720
...and I ran into Aidan.

1752
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:35,550
-Hello?
-Yes?

1753
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:39,560
And we decided to have dinner...

1754
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:46,230
...because it was so strange
to see each other there.

1755
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:52,780
And at dinner we were talking about
how happy we were in our marriages and--

1756
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:57,830
And when we went to say goodbye...

1757
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:00,580
...somehow...

1758
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:04,620
...we kissed.

1759
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:09,960
It didn't mean anything...

1760
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:12,670
...and it lasted only a second.

1761
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:15,590
And I'm sick about it.

1762
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:19,260
And the girls didn't know
if I should even tell you...

1763
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:22,100
...because it was just a kiss
and it means nothing.

1764
01:54:22,270 --> 01:54:26,270
But I told them...

1765
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:31,030
...that I couldn't have a secret from you.
That we don't have secrets.

1766
01:54:31,190 --> 01:54:35,860
And the secret
would just make it worse. So....

1767
01:54:36,530 --> 01:54:39,620
So I'm telling you.

1768
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:46,460
And I feel awful.

1769
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:52,630
And I'm sorry.

1770
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:59,970
Please say something.

1771
01:55:02,890 --> 01:55:04,180
I'm at work, Carrie.

1772
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,140
I have to go.

1773
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:08,020
Goodbye.

1774
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:28,540
- Hi. I was gonna call you back. I just
Carrie, this is outrageous.

1775
01:55:28,710 --> 01:55:30,500
-I've been arrested.
-Wait, wait, wait.

1776
01:55:30,670 --> 01:55:33,210
-Samantha, wait. What's wrong?
-You gotta get down here.

1777
01:55:38,050 --> 01:55:39,180
Get up.

1778
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:41,850
Samantha was arrested for having sex
on the beach.

1779
01:55:42,010 --> 01:55:44,180
She's at hotel security
and she needs a lawyer.

1780
01:55:44,350 --> 01:55:46,020
I'm on it.

1781
01:55:46,190 --> 01:55:47,850
No, no, no. That way.

1782
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:51,020
We did not have sex.
We were just kissing.

1783
01:55:51,190 --> 01:55:54,940
And this uptight couple told
the security guard to arrest us.

1784
01:55:55,110 --> 01:55:57,860
See, kissing is something. It's illegal.

1785
01:55:59,450 --> 01:56:01,820
Oh, Mr. Safir,
thank you so much for coming.

1786
01:56:01,990 --> 01:56:04,870
I'm so sorry
about this unfortunate situation.

1787
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:07,750
Ladies, if you don't mind waiting outside.

1788
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,960
I'm her attorney. I'm gonna stay.

1789
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:12,040
-Sure.
-We'll be right outside.

1790
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:23,220
-It's all right.
-So, what is the severity of the situation?

1791
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:29,060
The gentleman who reported the incident
is very conservative...

1792
01:56:29,230 --> 01:56:32,730
...and has insisted the offending event
be recorded.

1793
01:56:33,190 --> 01:56:36,110
Offending event? It was kissing.

1794
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:39,240
I understand your feelings.
But we will need your passport.

1795
01:56:39,410 --> 01:56:42,280
My passport? You gotta be kidding me.

1796
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:45,910
It's just to make a record.
To satisfy the complaining gentleman.

1797
01:56:48,830 --> 01:56:51,420
This is outrageous.

1798
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:52,580
I know. I know.

1799
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:56,090
It was just a kiss.

1800
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:58,420
Thank you.

1801
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:14,270
I guess I really missed who I used to be

1802
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:17,980
...and Aidan was such a big part
of that and

1803
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:21,200
Yes, I wanted the flirting,
and, yes, I wanted the attention.

1804
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:22,990
But I didn't want the kiss.

1805
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:25,780
The minute I kissed Aidan
I remembered who I used to be.

1806
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:30,290
Someone just running around New York
like a crazy person...

1807
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:33,500
...trying to get the one man I loved
to love me back.

1808
01:57:35,170 --> 01:57:36,500
And now he does love me...

1809
01:57:36,670 --> 01:57:41,470
...and he wants to sit on a couch
in New York City with me.

1810
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:49,020
And I really hope my past hasn't
screwed up my future.

1811
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:53,390
And what's so bad
about a couch anyway?

1812
01:57:57,230 --> 01:58:00,530
Oh, my God. I'm having a mid-wife crisis.

1813
01:58:05,450 --> 01:58:08,660
I should never have said anything to him.

1814
01:58:08,830 --> 01:58:12,910
The New Yorker was right to slap
a big piece of tape across my mouth.

1815
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:20,550
And I'm sorry for that thing I said
about your marriage earlier.

1816
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:22,340
I'm sorry too.

1817
01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:24,260
For what?

1818
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:28,180
For having an attitude
about that two-day idea.

1819
01:58:29,010 --> 01:58:32,230
I've had two days away,
I've gotten a little sleep...

1820
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:36,020
...and I am finally starting
to feel like myself again.

1821
01:58:36,190 --> 01:58:39,110
I think there's really something to it.

1822
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:43,030
Maybe.

1823
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:48,660
Well, let's just hope Big
doesn't want seven days off.

1824
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:54,580
And as morning arrived,
so did Samantha's release.

1825
01:58:54,750 --> 01:58:56,670
I am sorry it took me so long to arrive.

1826
01:58:56,830 --> 01:58:58,540
Well, you're here now, Mr. Mahmud.

1827
01:58:58,710 --> 01:59:01,460
I never got word
until I arrived at my office.

1828
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:04,050
I'm sorry that you had to come
all the way out here.

1829
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:06,970
-Well, it is all settled now.
-Thanks to you.

1830
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:09,970
-Good to see you again, ladies.
-Thank you so much.

1831
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:12,350
I'm starving.

1832
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:15,560
Hello? What's for breakfast?

1833
01:59:15,730 --> 01:59:19,060
Abdul? Anybody?

1834
01:59:19,230 --> 01:59:22,070
Well, that's odd. Where are they?

1835
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:27,240
-Hello?
-Miss Jones, please.

1836
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:29,490
Samantha. It's the front desk.

1837
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:34,410
-This is Samantha Jones.
-Miss Jones.

1838
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:36,250
This is Beydoun at the front desk.

1839
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:39,080
I will need a credit card number
for the room charges.

1840
01:59:39,710 --> 01:59:42,000
Beydoun, there must be some mistake.

1841
01:59:42,170 --> 01:59:46,420
I am a guest of Sheikh Khalid.
There is no room charge.

1842
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:49,430
Yes, I have a record of that.
But not from today on.

1843
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:53,430
What are you talking about? I have
a meeting with the sheikh on Tuesday.

1844
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:58,060
Ah, yes. I have a note here
from Mr. Mahmud.

1845
01:59:58,230 --> 02:00:00,980
That meeting is no longer as well.

1846
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:05,110
That sneaky bastard
has canceled the meeting...

1847
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,700
...and he wants us to pay
for the room from now on.

1848
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:11,450
We have you booked into the Jewel Suite
until Wednesday.

1849
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:13,950
The charge is 22,000 per night.

1850
02:00:14,910 --> 02:00:17,870
The room is $22,000 a night.

1851
02:00:18,710 --> 02:00:20,710
-What?
-We can't pay that.

1852
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:23,290
Let them sue me.

1853
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:28,050
The punishment for not paying
your hotel bill in the UAE is jail.

1854
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:32,800
What time is checkout?

1855
02:00:32,970 --> 02:00:34,640
In precisely one hour.

1856
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:40,560
We have an hour to pack
and get the fuck out of Abu Dhabi.

1857
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:42,310
What?

1858
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:44,570
What do you mean--?

1859
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:47,860
New Middle East, my ass.

1860
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:55,910
Fucking Paula Abdul.
Where is she when you need him?

1861
02:00:58,370 --> 02:00:59,710
Samantha!

1862
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:07,670
Samantha!

1863
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,920
I can't be ready in an hour!

1864
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:12,890
Then you better have $22,000 a night!

1865
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:15,180
Oh, my God.

1866
02:01:17,470 --> 02:01:19,520
All right. Okay.

1867
02:01:23,190 --> 02:01:25,770
I've got the bath products.

1868
02:01:28,530 --> 02:01:31,740
- Yes. Did you call about luggage?
- They're here for the luggage.

1869
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:35,030
Okay. I'm coming.

1870
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:51,550
Hi. I'm calling
to reconfirm four first-class tickets.

1871
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:52,930
- Oh, Christ.
- Are you okay?

1872
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:56,720
We were supposed to be
leaving on Tuesday, but....

1873
02:01:56,890 --> 02:01:58,560
Sir.

1874
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,390
-Shorts?
-I no longer care.

1875
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:03,940
I am going from here to a plane to America,
where legs are not the devil.

1876
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:05,400
At least zip up the jacket.

1877
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:08,480
I am having a hot flash in 119 degrees.
I may die.

1878
02:02:08,650 --> 02:02:10,030
Yes, miss.
- Hello.

1879
02:02:10,190 --> 02:02:12,650
We called down for two cabs going
to the airport.

1880
02:02:12,820 --> 02:02:15,240
Right away.
- Thank you.

1881
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:27,920
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

1882
02:02:28,090 --> 02:02:29,250
Oh, my God!

1883
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:31,800
-What?
-I forgot to buy Harry and the girls a gift.

1884
02:02:31,970 --> 02:02:34,680
- I've gotta run to the gift shop.
- Get them at the airport.

1885
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:38,140
How tacky. No, we have time.
The plane doesn't leave till 6.

1886
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:41,310
Not chancing it. It's a miracle
I got these seats rebooked.

1887
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:45,770
If anything goes wrong, we're flying back
13 and a half hours in coach.

1888
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:47,860
Buy them some crap at the airport.

1889
02:02:48,940 --> 02:02:51,110
It's not here. My passport.

1890
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:54,150
-Well, is it in another purse?
-No, no. I had it right here.

1891
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:57,280
I had it right here next to my money
and the spices.

1892
02:02:58,200 --> 02:02:59,620
Well, they're not here either.

1893
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:05,500
I left it where I bought the shoes.

1894
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:09,130
I put it on the counter and then when
I saw Aidan I got distracted and I

1895
02:03:09,290 --> 02:03:12,000
-It's all right. It's okay.
-I have to go back to the souk.

1896
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:14,800
-What if it's not there?
-It will be there. It has to be.

1897
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:16,260
-Miranda, go with me?
-Sure.

1898
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:18,470
-We'll all go.
-You don't have to do that.

1899
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:20,550
Yeah, like we'd dump you in Abu Dhabi.

1900
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:24,310
Sir, we need to leave the bags here.
We'll come back for them.

1901
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:27,770
No, no, no. Um, um. La, la, la, la.

1902
02:03:30,150 --> 02:03:31,820
No, no. No.

1903
02:03:31,980 --> 02:03:33,320
My nails!

1904
02:03:34,190 --> 02:03:36,530
No, sir. No! Not at all.
No. Not at all.

1905
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:38,360
They're loading the other car!

1906
02:03:43,290 --> 02:03:46,080
Will you stop with the jacket?
You're flashing religious men.

1907
02:03:46,250 --> 02:03:48,330
I don't care,
I'm baking from the inside out.

1908
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:50,170
How much farther?

1909
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:53,130
There he is. Yeah, there he is.

1910
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:57,340
Hello, sir. I was here the other day.

1911
02:03:57,510 --> 02:04:00,090
And I left a blue passport.

1912
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:05,020
Yes!

1913
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:07,850
Yes, that's me.
Oh, thank God. Thank Allah.

1914
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:13,860
-Just please accept this as a thank-you, sir.
-No, no, no.

1915
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:19,910
Oh, sir. Well, then, in that case,
shoes for everyone.

1916
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:22,280
Okay, ladies, on me.
Quick, quick, quick.

1917
02:04:22,450 --> 02:04:23,700
Oh, thank you, sir.

1918
02:04:23,870 --> 02:04:26,410
So I think this...

1919
02:04:26,580 --> 02:04:29,670
...should lead us right out
to Al Ben Abi Talib Street...

1920
02:04:29,830 --> 02:04:32,080
...and we can get a cab back
to the hotel and go.

1921
02:04:32,250 --> 02:04:33,710
-And how are we for time?
-Good.

1922
02:04:36,090 --> 02:04:39,220
Hello, miss. Rolex? Special price.

1923
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:40,930
Make beautiful gift for man.

1924
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:45,640
-Do you have it in silver?
-Yes. Upstairs. Come.

1925
02:04:45,810 --> 02:04:47,480
-This one or this one.
-Not this one.

1926
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:48,770
-Oh, craps.
-Wait!

1927
02:04:48,940 --> 02:04:51,230
-I think it's--
-Charlotte's buying a watch.

1928
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:52,900
Miss.

1929
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:54,900
- Welcome.
- Excuse us.

1930
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:58,070
- Ladies, come this way. Upstairs.
- Wait, wait, wait. Hello?

1931
02:04:59,950 --> 02:05:01,990
We're with them.

1932
02:05:02,410 --> 02:05:03,870
Them. Them.

1933
02:05:04,030 --> 02:05:05,490
Okay.

1934
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:10,790
We have many designer bags.

1935
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:13,580
- Right through there.
- Very good, very nice.

1936
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:15,540
- You really enjoy this store.
- Yes.

1937
02:05:15,710 --> 02:05:17,760
- Please, have seat. Please.
- Very good.

1938
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:19,760
-Yes.
-Welcome.

1939
02:05:19,930 --> 02:05:21,010
-Thank you.
-This is....

1940
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:26,180
Carrie. This is the watch you gave Big,
right? This could be Harry's gift.

1941
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:28,770
No. Mine was vintage.
We should go. We should go.

1942
02:05:28,930 --> 02:05:30,940
-We have ladies' watches too, huh?
-Yeah.

1943
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:33,770
We really, really need to go right now.

1944
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:35,940
Is there any air in here?

1945
02:05:36,110 --> 02:05:38,360
-I have many other kinds.
-No, I'm so sorry.

1946
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:40,690
We're going to miss our plane,
so nothing.

1947
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:42,110
Thank you. Thank you.

1948
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:43,780
-Beautiful.
-You want watch, yes?

1949
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:46,200
-No, no, no. She didn't want anything.
-No.

1950
02:05:46,370 --> 02:05:47,700
-Sorry.
-Thank you, though.

1951
02:05:47,870 --> 02:05:49,790
Go. Then go.

1952
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:52,710
-We have to go.
-No, you have to put this on...

1953
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:54,670
-...before we go outside.
-You go.

1954
02:05:54,830 --> 02:05:56,380
-Sorry.
-No purse? No purse?

1955
02:05:56,550 --> 02:06:00,970
-Thank you, sir.
-No purse? Purse? No purse?

1956
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:09,310
-It's forbidden.
-What?

1957
02:06:09,470 --> 02:06:11,020
It--

1958
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:15,980
-What's that?
-It's the call to prayer.

1959
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:17,310
Hey, lady!

1960
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:22,320
Hey, you! Hey, you. I see you steal this.

1961
02:06:22,490 --> 02:06:24,360
-This is mine!
-I seen you take it!

1962
02:06:24,530 --> 02:06:26,740
I didn't steal it! It's mine!

1963
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:34,580
You broke my Birkin!

1964
02:06:35,170 --> 02:06:36,540
Sorry. Mistake.

1965
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:52,890
Condoms! Condoms, yes! Condoms!

1966
02:06:54,810 --> 02:06:57,520
-I have sex!
-Okay, okay.

1967
02:06:57,690 --> 02:06:59,900
-Samantha.
-Yes! Yes!

1968
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:05,280
I have condoms!

1969
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:07,700
Here they are!

1970
02:07:08,830 --> 02:07:09,870
Bite me!

1971
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:18,290
-Bite me! Oh, bite me!
-No, no, no.

1972
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:23,260
Go, go. Keep going.

1973
02:07:24,550 --> 02:07:26,220
Put your jacket on.

1974
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:29,890
You're worried about getting old?
You're exactly the same as when I met you.

1975
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:32,930
-Yes, I am. Good for me.
-Oh, they're following us.

1976
02:07:33,100 --> 02:07:36,190
Yes, because that was major disrespect.
And it's against the law.

1977
02:07:36,350 --> 02:07:38,600
-So, what do we do?
-Just keep walking and pray...

1978
02:07:38,770 --> 02:07:40,770
...no one calls a cop.

1979
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:53,410
I think they want us to follow them.

1980
02:07:57,540 --> 02:07:59,120
- I think we should.
- Okay, go.

1981
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:00,630
Okay.

1982
02:08:12,390 --> 02:08:15,270
All right. All right. Here we go.

1983
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:23,440
Hello.

1984
02:08:28,530 --> 02:08:30,530
You are welcome, you are welcome.

1985
02:08:33,950 --> 02:08:35,950
That was quite a show outside.

1986
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:37,160
Terrible.

1987
02:08:37,330 --> 02:08:39,040
So disrespectful.

1988
02:08:39,210 --> 02:08:40,500
Yes.

1989
02:08:41,460 --> 02:08:42,790
I quite enjoyed it.

1990
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:49,510
-And the men will be outraged for weeks.
-For months. Some, perhaps years.

1991
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:54,010
Could I bother you for a glass of water?
I'm burning up.

1992
02:08:54,180 --> 02:08:56,140
-Yes.
-Hot flashes.

1993
02:08:57,980 --> 02:09:00,560
Yeah. She knows.

1994
02:09:00,730 --> 02:09:02,900
Have you read this?

1995
02:09:04,150 --> 02:09:07,070
We are discussing it
in our book club today.

1996
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:08,860
-Suzanne Somers.
-Suzanne Somers.

1997
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:10,490
-Suzanne Somers.
-Suzanne Somers.

1998
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:12,700
Lady gets around.

1999
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:14,700
They took my creams.

2000
02:09:17,620 --> 02:09:20,160
I take it you are visiting
from the United States?

2001
02:09:20,330 --> 02:09:23,380
-New York City.
-New York?

2002
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,630
Carnegie Hall, Fifth Avenue.

2003
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:33,840
You've been to New York?

2004
02:09:34,470 --> 02:09:36,180
No.

2005
02:09:36,930 --> 02:09:39,220
But we love the fashion.

2006
02:09:46,690 --> 02:09:48,110
-Louis Vuitton.
-Yes.

2007
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:50,190
Yes.

2008
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:56,280
And there, in a dried-flower shop,
halfway across the world...

2009
02:09:56,450 --> 02:09:59,160
...underneath hundreds of years
of tradition...

2010
02:09:59,330 --> 02:10:01,710
...was this year's spring collection.

2011
02:10:01,870 --> 02:10:03,920
-So beautiful.
-So pretty.

2012
02:10:12,010 --> 02:10:15,550
-What'd she say? What'd she say?
-Something, something, Arab women.

2013
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:19,390
Would you like anything to drink?
Coffee, tea? Anything, really.

2014
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:23,770
Sorry. If we don't leave now,
we'll miss our flight.

2015
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:27,110
But what about those angry men
out there?

2016
02:10:27,270 --> 02:10:29,730
How are we gonna get past them?

2017
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:36,070
All clear.

2018
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:38,030
This way.

2019
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:47,790
It's this way.

2020
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:51,210
Hey, where's Charlotte?

2021
02:10:51,550 --> 02:10:53,130
-She was behind you.
-No, I know.

2022
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:57,260
I'm gonna fucking kill her. If we miss
that flight, we're flying home coach.

2023
02:10:57,430 --> 02:11:01,140
Shoes, the shoes. Look for her shoes.
She was wearing purple peep-toe platforms.

2024
02:11:01,310 --> 02:11:02,520
-Got it.
-Right.

2025
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:11,360
There she is.

2026
02:11:12,610 --> 02:11:13,990
Charlotte!

2027
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:16,490
Look! For the girls!

2028
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:18,950
Taxi!

2029
02:11:20,870 --> 02:11:23,580
- Taxi!
- Don't women here take cabs?

2030
02:11:23,750 --> 02:11:25,160
Taxi!

2031
02:11:25,330 --> 02:11:29,040
Why won't they stop? We're out of time.
We're gonna get bumped from first class.

2032
02:11:29,210 --> 02:11:31,130
I can't be in menopause and in coach.

2033
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:35,170
I have an idea. Hold this.

2034
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:37,630
-What's she doing?
-I don't know.

2035
02:11:48,940 --> 02:11:50,270
- Oh, hurry.
- Get in.

2036
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:51,440
I'll get in the front.

2037
02:11:51,570 --> 02:11:53,280
Thank you so much.
Thank you, sir. Oh, yes.

2038
02:11:53,530 --> 02:11:57,360
We're going to the Taj Al Saharaa.

2039
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:07,790
Thank you.

2040
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:13,590
Do you have anything to declare?

2041
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:15,670
Yes. I'm a mess.

2042
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:19,840
Thank you.

2043
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:23,850
Do you have anything to declare?

2044
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:29,020
Turns out, Big never met me
at the airport like he promised.

2045
02:12:29,190 --> 02:12:31,690
-Thank you, William.
-No problem, Mrs. Preston.

2046
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:53,540
John?

2047
02:12:57,220 --> 02:12:59,970
No Big and no TV.

2048
02:13:04,850 --> 02:13:06,720
- Here comes Mommy.
- Here comes Mommy.

2049
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:09,100
- Hey, there she is.
- Mommy, hi.

2050
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:12,400
Let's say hello, let's say hello.
- Oh, I missed you so much.

2051
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:15,440
- Hi! Baby Rose.
- Hello, my love.

2052
02:13:15,610 --> 02:13:18,780
- I missed you so much.
- Mommy.

2053
02:13:37,090 --> 02:13:40,050
I can't pick up,
so please leave me a message.

2054
02:13:40,220 --> 02:13:42,800
Hi, it's me. I'm home.

2055
02:13:43,140 --> 02:13:44,930
Where are you?

2056
02:14:15,710 --> 02:14:17,460
Hi.

2057
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:20,460
Where you been all day?

2058
02:14:22,220 --> 02:14:24,220
Walking around.

2059
02:14:25,550 --> 02:14:27,470
Killing time.

2060
02:14:30,270 --> 02:14:31,480
Torturing you.

2061
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:34,140
Well, it worked.

2062
02:14:35,650 --> 02:14:38,480
-I thought you weren't gonna come back.
-Oh, no.

2063
02:14:39,110 --> 02:14:41,110
I'm a grownup.

2064
02:14:41,530 --> 02:14:42,820
And I made a vow.

2065
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:45,490
Remember?

2066
02:14:45,990 --> 02:14:47,990
Ever thine, ever mine.

2067
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:49,530
Ever ours.

2068
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:00,500
Just so you know...

2069
02:15:01,420 --> 02:15:03,340
...that really tore me up.

2070
02:15:03,670 --> 02:15:05,720
I'm sorry.

2071
02:15:06,890 --> 02:15:09,600
You know, it seems to me
that you're a bit of a rookie...

2072
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:12,020
...when it comes
to this whole marriage idea.

2073
02:15:12,850 --> 02:15:15,020
And maybe in light of what happened...

2074
02:15:15,190 --> 02:15:18,360
...until you get a better understanding
of what this is all about...

2075
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:20,770
...you need a little reminder.

2076
02:15:24,150 --> 02:15:26,700
This is your punishment.

2077
02:15:28,990 --> 02:15:33,040
You have to wear this every day
so that you remember...

2078
02:15:33,910 --> 02:15:34,960
...you're married.

2079
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:38,290
Gladly.

2080
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:42,380
It dawned on me
when I was walking around...

2081
02:15:42,550 --> 02:15:46,090
...that while you wrote
a funny book about vows...

2082
02:15:46,260 --> 02:15:49,680
...you never actually wrote any vows
from you to me.

2083
02:15:50,390 --> 02:15:52,060
Oh, I did.

2084
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:55,310
But then that wedding never happened.

2085
02:15:57,230 --> 02:15:59,980
I guess we all make stupid mistakes.

2086
02:16:03,030 --> 02:16:04,650
You were saying.

2087
02:16:04,820 --> 02:16:06,440
Vows.

2088
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:10,370
I took the liberty of making up
some vows for you.

2089
02:16:10,530 --> 02:16:13,240
Repeat after me, please.

2090
02:16:13,410 --> 02:16:16,330
I will never kiss another man other
than my husband.

2091
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:19,250
I will never kiss another man other
than my husband.

2092
02:16:19,420 --> 02:16:22,380
I will stop worrying
about being a boring old married couple...

2093
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:24,920
...because we never will be.

2094
02:16:25,090 --> 02:16:29,180
I will stop worrying
about being a boring old married couple...

2095
02:16:29,340 --> 02:16:31,850
...because we never will be.

2096
02:16:32,430 --> 02:16:34,100
Are you sure?

2097
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:37,230
It's gonna be just us two.

2098
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:40,020
Are we enough?

2099
02:16:41,060 --> 02:16:42,770
Kid...

2100
02:16:43,270 --> 02:16:44,770
...we're too much.

2101
02:16:49,950 --> 02:16:51,530
How's that for a little sparkle?

2102
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:55,450
That's a lot of sparkle.

2103
02:16:58,330 --> 02:17:00,460
Why'd you get a black diamond?

2104
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:03,290
Because you're not like anyone else.

2105
02:17:04,590 --> 02:17:06,000
That's a relief.

2106
02:17:06,170 --> 02:17:09,760
I thought you were gonna say
it's the color of my soul.

2107
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:18,980
And, like it always will,
time moved us on.

2108
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:21,020
And in the future--

2109
02:17:21,190 --> 02:17:24,400
I am proud to report
that the settlement we attained...

2110
02:17:24,570 --> 02:17:27,780
...for Global Families Incorporated
surpassed their expectations.

2111
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:32,660
--Miranda learned that at the right law firm,
where her voice was valued...

2112
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:36,030
...she was also fun at work.

2113
02:17:37,910 --> 02:17:42,040
And that July 4th,
on an East Hampton sand dune...

2114
02:17:43,380 --> 02:17:47,500
...Samantha learned that good things
do come to those who wait...

2115
02:17:47,670 --> 02:17:53,510
...when she and Rikard
resumed their date in the land of the free...

2116
02:17:55,390 --> 02:17:57,390
...and the home of the hormones.

2117
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:08,480
And Charlotte learned that she never
really had anything to worry about.

2118
02:18:08,650 --> 02:18:14,200
Turns out, her hot nanny preferred
the company of other hot nannies.

2119
02:18:14,370 --> 02:18:16,450
Stanford, here's a refresher.
- Yes, please.

2120
02:18:16,620 --> 02:18:19,830
-Happy birthday.
-What are you doing? You drank it all?

2121
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,040
And as Rose turned 3...

2122
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:30,130
...and our marriage grew out
of the terrible twos...

2123
02:18:30,300 --> 02:18:35,220
...Big and I found less and less need
to escape to the other apartment.

2124
02:18:38,930 --> 02:18:41,770
But we kept the option open.

2125
02:18:41,930 --> 02:18:45,400
Just in case someone
needed those two days off.

2126
02:19:01,370 --> 02:19:03,790
As for me, I began to think of marriage...

2127
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:07,750
...much like the Real Housewife
of Abu Dhabi's veil.

2128
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:13,130
You have to take the tradition
and decorate it your way.

2129
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:19,390
trying to make up my mind for me.

2130
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:21,930
Well, stop it and do as I tell you.

2131
02:19:23,100 --> 02:19:25,310
Leopold.
- Never take a stubborn woman...

2132
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:28,440
...they're a curse. My mother
warned me against stubborn women.

2133
02:19:28,610 --> 02:19:29,610
Leopold.

2134
02:19:29,770 --> 02:19:32,650
Now, stop following me
or I'll call the police.

2135
02:19:36,780 --> 02:19:40,780
Because while movies may be
wonderful in black and white...

2136
02:19:40,950 --> 02:19:43,120
...when it comes to relationships...

2137
02:19:43,290 --> 02:19:47,580
...there's a whole range of colors
and options to explore.

2138
02:19:47,750 --> 02:19:51,210
And that's where I am today.
