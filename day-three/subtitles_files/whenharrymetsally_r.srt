1
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:19,370
I was sitting with my friend
Arthur Kornblum in a restaurant.

2
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:22,653
It was the Horn & Hardert Cafeteria.

3
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:25,432
And this beautiful girl walked in,

4
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:28,311
and I turned to Arthur, and I said,

5
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:30,738
"Arthur, you see that girl?

6
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:32,512
I'm going to marry her."

7
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:35,267
And two weeks later, we were married.

8
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:38,830
And it's over fifty years later...

9
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:40,949
and we're still married.

10
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:57,970
- I love you.
- I love you.

11
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,043
 

12
00:03:31,913 --> 00:03:33,341
Oh, hi, Sally.

13
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:36,960
Sally, this is Harry Burns.
Harry, this is Sally Albright.

14
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:38,541
Nice to meet you.

15
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:42,191
- You want to drive the first shift?
- No, you're there already. You can start.

16
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:43,798
Back's open.

17
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,957
- Call me.
- I'll call you as soon as I get there.

18
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,715
Oh, call me from the road.

19
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,440
I'll call you before then.

20
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:54,589
- I love you.
- I love you.

21
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:01,199
Sorry.

22
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:04,874
- I miss you already.
- I miss you.

23
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:06,806
- Bye.
- Bye.

24
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:26,912
I have it all figured out.
It's an eighteen-hour trip,

25
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:29,204
which breaks down into
six shifts of three hours each,

26
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:32,723
or alternatively
we could break it down by mileage.

27
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,662
There's a map on the visor

28
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:40,542
that I've marked to show the locations
where we can change shifts.

29
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:42,421
Grape?

30
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,454
No. I don't like to eat between meals.

31
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,490
I'll roll down the window.

32
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,250
Why don't you tell me the story of your life.

33
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:09,059
- The story of my life?
- We got eighteen hours to kill
before we hit New York.

34
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:11,528
The story of my life isn't even
gonna get us out of Chicago.

35
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:13,287
I mean nothing's happened to me yet.

36
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:14,678
That's why I'm going to New York.

37
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:16,184
- So something'll happen to you?
- Yes.

38
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,080
Like what?

39
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,136
Like I'm going to journalism
school to become a reporter.

40
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:23,110
So you can write about things
that happen to other people.

41
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:27,105
- That's one way to look at it.
- Suppose nothing happens to you?

42
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:29,271
Suppose you live there your
whole life and nothing happens?

43
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:31,279
You never meet anybody,
You never become anything.

44
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:33,092
And finally you die
one of those New York deaths...

45
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:36,753
where nobody notices for two weeks
until the smell drifts into the hallway.

46
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,524
- Amanda mentioned you had a dark side.
- That's what drew her to me.

47
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:45,939
- Your dark side?
- Sure. Why, don't you have a dark side?

48
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,961
I know, you're probably one of those cheerful
people who dots their "I's" with hearts.

49
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,667
I have just as much of a
dark side as the next person.

50
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:53,747
Oh, really?

51
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:56,354
When I buy a new book,
I always read the last page first.

52
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,037
That way, in case I die
before I finish, I know how it ends.

53
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,741
That, my friend, is a dark side.

54
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,483
That doesn't mean you're
deep or anything. I mean,

55
00:06:04,553 --> 00:06:07,152
- Yes, basically I'm a happy person.
- So am I.

56
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:09,213
And I don't see that there's
anything wrong with that.

57
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:12,652
Of course not. You're too busy being happy.
You ever think about death?

58
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,947
- Yes.
- Sure you do.

59
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:16,665
A fleeting thought that drifts
in and out of the transom of your mind.

60
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:18,441
I spend hours, I spend days.

61
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:20,351
And you think this makes you a better person?

62
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:23,755
Look, when the shit comes down,
I'm gonna be prepared, and you're not.

63
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,573
That's all I'm saying.

64
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:27,914
In the meantime, you're gonna ruin
your whole life waiting for it.

65
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:38,349
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

66
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,679
He wants her to leave.
That's why he puts her on the plane.

67
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:43,949
- I don't think she wants to stay.
- Of course she wants to stay.

68
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:46,783
Wouldn't you rather be with
Humphrey Bogart than the other guy?

69
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:50,189
I don't want to spend the
rest of my life in Casablanca,

70
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:52,272
married to a man who runs a bar.

71
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,779
That probably sounds very
snobbish to you, but I don't.

72
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:58,594
- You'd rather be in a passionless marriage...
- And be the first lady of Czechoslovakia.

73
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,443
...than live with a man you've had
the greatest sex of your life with,

74
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:04,185
just because he owns a bar
and that is all he does?

75
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:05,305
Yes.

76
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:08,047
And so would any woman in her right mind.

77
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:10,642
Women are very practical, even Ingrid Bergman,

78
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,450
which is why she gets on the plane
at the end of the movie.

79
00:07:17,564 --> 00:07:18,953
I understand.

80
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:21,423
What? What?

81
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:23,473
- Nothing.
- What?

82
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:25,478
Forget about it.

83
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:27,142
- Forget about what?
- It's not important.

84
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,099
No, just tell me.

85
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,710
Obviously you haven't had great sex yet.

86
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:35,307
- Two, please.
- Right over there.

87
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,403
- Yes, I have.
- No, you haven't.

88
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:41,550
It just so happens that
I have had plenty of good sex.

89
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:01,264
With whom?

90
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:03,032
What?

91
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,691
With whom did you have this great sex?

92
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:08,009
I'm not gonna tell you that.

93
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,962
Fine. Don't tell me.

94
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:16,930
Shel Gordon.

95
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,182
Shel? Sheldon?

96
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,782
No. No, you did not have
great sex with Sheldon.

97
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,156
- I did too.
- No, you didn't.

98
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,856
Sheldon can do your income taxes.

99
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,301
If you need a root canal, Sheldon's your man.

100
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:32,697
But humping and pumping
is not Sheldon's strong suit.

101
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:34,661
It's the name. "Do it to me, Sheldon."

102
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:36,201
"You're an animal, Sheldon."

103
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:38,289
"Ride me, big Sheldon."

104
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:39,891
It doesn't work.

105
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:40,739
Hi.

106
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,968
- What can I get you?
- I'll have a number three.

107
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:47,741
I'd like the chef's salad, please,
with the oil and vinegar on the side,

108
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:49,322
and the apple pie a la mode.

109
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:52,851
Chef and apple a la mode.

110
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,612
But I'd like the pie heated, and I don't want
the ice cream on top, I want it on the side.

111
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,978
And I'd like strawberry
instead of vanilla, if you have it.

112
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:01,571
If not, then no ice cream,
just whipped cream, but only if it's real.

113
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:03,116
If it's out of a can, then nothing.

114
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:04,420
Not even the pie?

115
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,126
No, just the pie, but then not heated.

116
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,657
Uh huh.

117
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,700
What?

118
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:17,042
Nothing, nothing.

119
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:20,683
So how come you broke up with Sheldon?

120
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:22,271
How do you know we broke up?

121
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,721
Because if you didn't break up,
you wouldn't be here with me.

122
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:26,948
You'd be off with Sheldon, the Wonder Schlong.

123
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:31,106
First of all, I am not "with" you.

124
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:34,589
And second of all, it is none
of your business why we broke up.

125
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,511
You're right. I don't wanna know.

126
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:43,833
Well if you must know,
it was because he was very jealous,

127
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:45,965
and I had these "Days of the Week" underpants.

128
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:49,144
I'm sorry. I need a judge's ruling on this.

129
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:50,868
"Days of the Week" underpants?

130
00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:53,328
Yes. They had the days of the week on them,

131
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:55,203
and I thought they were sorta funny.

132
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:58,995
And then, one day, Sheldon says to me,
"You never wear Sunday."

133
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:02,171
He's all suspicious.
Where was Sunday? Where had I left Sunday?

134
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:04,635
And I told him, and he didn't believe me.

135
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:07,816
- What?
- They don't make Sunday.

136
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,499
- Why not?
- Because of God.

137
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,020
Okay, so fifteen percent of my share

138
00:10:18,046 --> 00:10:19,953
is ninety.

139
00:10:20,776 --> 00:10:22,310
$6.90.

140
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:27,345
Let's leave seven.

141
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:31,985
What?

142
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:36,599
Do I have something on my face?

143
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:39,770
You're a very attractive person.

144
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:43,028
Thank you.

145
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:45,360
Amanda never said how attractive you were.

146
00:10:45,555 --> 00:10:47,728
Well, maybe she doesn't think I'm attractive.

147
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:52,362
I don't think it's a matter of opinion.
Empirically, you are attractive.

148
00:10:54,283 --> 00:10:56,307
Amanda is my friend.

149
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,871
So?

150
00:10:58,378 --> 00:11:00,867
- So you're going with her.
- So?

151
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:03,440
So you're coming on to me.

152
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:05,542
No, I wasn't.

153
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:08,567
What?

154
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,831
Can't a man say a woman is attractive
without it being a come-on?

155
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:14,580
All right, all right.

156
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:19,381
Let's just say, just for the sake
of argument, that it was a come-on.

157
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,509
What do you want me to do about it?
I take it back, okay?

158
00:11:23,658 --> 00:11:26,003
- You can't take it back.
- Why not?

159
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,857
Because it's already out there.

160
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:31,693
Oh, Geez, what are we supposed to do?
Call the cops. It's already out there.

161
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:35,405
Just let it lie. Okay?

162
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:37,453
Great. Let it lie.

163
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,493
That's my policy.

164
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:42,817
That's what I always say: Let it lie.

165
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:44,795
Wanna spend the night in a motel?

166
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:46,496
See what I did? I didn't let it lie.

167
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:46,938
Harry.

168
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:48,460
- I said I would, then I didn't.
- Harry.

169
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,558
- I went the other way.
- Harry.

170
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,081
What?

171
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:53,361
We are just going to be friends, okay?

172
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:56,000
Great. Friends. It's the best thing.

173
00:11:57,404 --> 00:12:00,066
You realize, of course,
that we could never be friends.

174
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:01,501
Why not?

175
00:12:01,683 --> 00:12:06,120
What I'm saying is, and this is not
a come-on in any way, shape or form,

176
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:10,840
is that men and women can't be friends
because the sex part always gets in the way.

177
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,015
That's not true.

178
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:17,180
I have a number of men friends,
and there is no sex involved.

179
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,492
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

180
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:19,867
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

181
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:21,147
You only think you do.

182
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,501
You're saying I'm having sex
with these men without my knowledge?

183
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,715
No. What I'm saying is,
they all wanna have sex with you.

184
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:28,675
- They do not.
- Do too.

185
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:30,185
- They do not.
- Do too.

186
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:32,038
How do you know?

187
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,999
Because no man can be friends
with a woman that he finds attractive.

188
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:37,234
He always wants to have sex with her.

189
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,157
So you're saying that a man can be friends
with a woman he finds unattractive.

190
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,911
No. You pretty much wanna nail 'em too.

191
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,232
What if they don't want to have sex with you?

192
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,681
Doesn't matter, because the
sex thing is already out there,

193
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:54,743
so the friendship is ultimately doomed,
and that is the end of the story.

194
00:12:55,656 --> 00:12:58,520
- Well, I guess we're not gonna be friends then.
- Guess not.

195
00:12:58,598 --> 00:13:00,256
That's too bad.

196
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,754
You were the only person
that I knew in New York.

197
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:45,815
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah. It was interesting.

198
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:48,578
- It was nice knowing you.
- Yeah.

199
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,042
Well, have a nice life.

200
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:02,208
You too.

201
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:21,578
We fell in love in high school.

202
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:23,976
Yeah, we were high school sweethearts.

203
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:27,102
But then after our junior year,
his parents moved away.

204
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:29,287
But I never forgot her.

205
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,290
He never forgot me.

206
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:34,866
Her face was burned on my brain.

207
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:38,661
And it was thirty-four years later
that I was walking down Broadway,

208
00:14:38,717 --> 00:14:41,021
and I saw her come out of Toffenetti's.

209
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:42,812
We both looked at each other...

210
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:47,530
and it was just as though
not a single day had gone by.

211
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:51,347
She was just as beautiful
as she was at sixteen.

212
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:53,744
He was just the same.

213
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:56,378
He looked exactly the same.

214
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:31,911
Joe! I thought it was you.
I thought it was you.

215
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:34,078
- Harry Burns.
- Harry, how're you doin'?

216
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:36,519
- Good. How are you doing?
- Fine. I'm doing fine.

217
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:37,141
Yeah, that's great.

218
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,003
I was just walking by
and I thought it was you.

219
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:39,848
And here it is, it's you.

220
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:41,418
Yeah, yeah, it was.

221
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:42,551
You still with the DA's office?

222
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:45,765
No. I switched to the other side.
What about you?

223
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:48,051
I work with a small firm.
We do political consulting.

224
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:49,362
- Uh huh.
- Yeah, it's great.

225
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:50,027
Yeah.

226
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:54,866
Oh, Harry, this is Sally Albright. Harry Burns.

227
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,794
Harry and I, we used to...
We lived in the same building.

228
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:04,075
Well, listen, I got a plane to catch.
It was really good to see you, Joe.

229
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:05,568
- You too, Harry.
- Bye.

230
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:13,836
Thank God he couldn't place me.

231
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:16,199
I drove from college to New York
with him five years ago,

232
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,159
and it was the longest night of my life.

233
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:21,948
What happened?

234
00:16:21,988 --> 00:16:24,053
He made a pass at me, and when I said no,

235
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,751
he was going with a girlfriend of mine.

236
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:30,903
Oh, God, I can't remember her name.

237
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,483
Don't get involved with me, Joe.

238
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:36,462
I'm twenty-six years old, and I can't even remember
the name of the girl I was such good friends with,

239
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:38,583
I wouldn't get involved with her boyfriend.

240
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:40,744
So what happened?

241
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,584
- When?
- When he made a pass at you, you said no?

242
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,594
Oh, oh.

243
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:46,845
I said we could just be friends.

244
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,897
And this part I remember. He said that men
and women could never really be friends.

245
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:54,927
Do you think that's true?

246
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,133
No.

247
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,503
Do you have any women friends? Just friends?

248
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:02,038
No.

249
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:05,631
But I will get one if it's important to you.

250
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:09,719
Amanda Reese.

251
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,350
That was her name. Thank God!

252
00:17:12,418 --> 00:17:14,010
I will miss you.

253
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:16,044
I love you.

254
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,954
You do?

255
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,090
Yes.

256
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:22,919
I love you.

257
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,081
And what would you like to drink?

258
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:50,722
- Nothing, thanks.
- Do you have any Bloody Mary mix?

259
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,943
- Yes.
- No, wait. Here's what I want:

260
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:56,704
Regular tomato juice,
filled up about three quarters.

261
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,392
Then add just a splash of
Bloody Mary mix, just a splash,

262
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:01,513
and a piece of lime, but on the side.

263
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:03,582
The University of Chicago, right?

264
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:05,955
Yes.

265
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:08,372
Did you look this good
at the University of Chicago?

266
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:10,282
- No.
- Did we ever...

267
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:12,964
No, no.

268
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,289
We drove from Chicago to New York
together after graduation.

269
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:19,574
Would you two like to sit together?

270
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,790
- No.
- Great! Thank you.

271
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:30,263
You were a good friend of...

272
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:31,903
Amanda's.

273
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,707
I can't believe you can't remember her name.

274
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:35,993
What do you mean? I can remember.

275
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,444
Amanda, right? Amanda Rice.

276
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:39,190
- Reese.
- Reese, right. That's what I said.

277
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:40,184
What ever happened to her?

278
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:43,056
- I have no idea.
- You have no idea?

279
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,420
You were really good friends with her.
We didn't make it because you were such good friends.

280
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:48,690
- You went with her.
- And was it worth it?

281
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,273
The sacrifice for a friend that
you don't even keep in touch with?

282
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,672
Harry, you might not believe this,

283
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:57,504
but I never considered
not sleeping with you a sacrifice.

284
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:01,128
Fair enough. Fair enough.

285
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:05,907
- You were gonna be a gymnast.
- A journalist.

286
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:07,805
Right, that's what I said. And?

287
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,073
I am a journalist. I work at The News.

288
00:19:10,243 --> 00:19:12,308
Great. And you're with Joe.

289
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:14,350
Well, that's great.

290
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:17,406
Great. You're together what, three weeks?

291
00:19:19,237 --> 00:19:21,249
A month. How did you know that?

292
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:24,260
You take someone to the airport, it's
clearly at the beginning of a relationship.

293
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:26,388
That's why I've never taken
anyone to the airport

294
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:28,332
at the beginning of a relationship.

295
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:29,370
Why?

296
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:32,666
Because eventually things move on,
and you don't take someone to the airport

297
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,392
and I never wanted anyone to say to me,

298
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:36,900
"How come you never take me
to the airport anymore?"

299
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,808
It's amazing. You look like a normal person,

300
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:43,340
but actually you are the Angel of Death.

301
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:45,381
Are you gonna marry him?

302
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,369
We have only known each other for a month,

303
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,167
and besides, neither one of us
is looking to get married right now.

304
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:54,061
- Hmm, I'm getting married.
- You are?

305
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:54,777
 

306
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,515
- You are?
- Yeah.

307
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,828
Who is she?

308
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:02,903
Helen Hillson. She's a lawyer.
She's keeping her name.

309
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,503
- You're getting married?
- Yeah.

310
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:09,634
What's so funny about that?

311
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:15,173
It's just so optimistic of you, Harry.

312
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:17,993
Well, you'd be amazed what falling
madly in love can do for you.

313
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:21,623
Well, it's wonderful. It's nice to see you
embracing life in this manner.

314
00:20:21,831 --> 00:20:25,680
Yeah. Plus, you konw, you just get to a certain
point where you get tired of the whole thing.

315
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:29,153
- What whole thing?
- The whole "life of a single guy" thing.

316
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,388
You meet someone. You have the safe lunch.

317
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:33,853
You decide you like each other
enough to move on to dinner.

318
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:37,097
You go dancing.
You do the White Man's Overbite.

319
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:40,438
Go back to her place, you have sex,
and the minute you're finished,

320
00:20:40,464 --> 00:20:41,605
you know what goes through your mind?

321
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:45,602
"How long do I have to lie here and
hold her before I can get up and go home?

322
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:47,309
Is thirty seconds enough?"

323
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:50,741
That's what you're thinking? Is that true?

324
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:52,941
Sure. All men think that.

325
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:56,743
How long do you like to be held
afterwards? All night, right?

326
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:58,002
See? That's the problem.

327
00:20:58,105 --> 00:21:00,782
Somewhere between thirty seconds
and all night is your problem.

328
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:03,692
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah, you do.

329
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:21,485
- Staying over?
- Yes.

330
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:25,086
Would you like to have dinner? Just friends.

331
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,912
I thought you didn't believe
men and women could be friends.

332
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:29,984
- When did I say that?
- On the ride to New York.

333
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,795
No, no no no, I never said that.

334
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,015
Yes, that's right.

335
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,789
They can't be friends...

336
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:39,728
unless both of them are involved
with other people. Then they can.

337
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:41,730
This is an amendment to the earlier rule.

338
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:43,390
If two people are in relationships

339
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:46,519
the pressure of possible involvement is lifted.

340
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:50,274
That doesn't work either, because what happens
then is the person you're involved with

341
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:53,160
can't understand why you need to be friends
with the person you're just friends with,

342
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:56,668
like it means something is missing from the
relationship and you wanna get outside to get it.

343
00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:59,878
Then when you say, "No, no no, it's not ture.
Nothing is missing from the relationship,"

344
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:02,031
the person you're involved with then accuses you

345
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:04,662
of being secretly attracted to
the person you're just friends with,

346
00:22:04,688 --> 00:22:07,743
which you probably are. I mean, come on!
Who the hell are we kidding? Let's face it.

347
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:09,919
Which brings us back to early
the rule before the amendment,

348
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:13,043
which is men and women can't be friends.
So where's that leave us?

349
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,412
- Harry?
- What?

350
00:22:14,698 --> 00:22:16,188
Goodbye.

351
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:28,365
I'll just stop walking. I'll let you go ahead.

352
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:34,498
We were married forty years ago.

353
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:36,638
We were married three years, we got a divorce.

354
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,903
- Then I married Marjorie.
- But first you lived with Barbara.

355
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:40,878
Right. Barbara.

356
00:22:41,023 --> 00:22:43,579
But I didn't marry Barbara.
I married Marjorie.

357
00:22:43,806 --> 00:22:47,022
- Then he got a divorce.
- Right. Then I married Katie.

358
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,432
Another divorce.

359
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,554
Then a couple of years later
at Eddie Collecio's funeral,

360
00:22:51,728 --> 00:22:53,447
I ran into her.

361
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:56,443
I was with some girl I don't even remember.

362
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:59,603
- Roberta.
- Right. Roberta.

363
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:01,886
But I couldn't take my eyes off you.

364
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:04,699
I remember I snuck over to her and I said,

365
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,008
What did I say?

366
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:09,551
- You said, "What are you doing after?"
- Right.

367
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,517
So I ditched Roberta. We go for coffee.
A month later, we're married.

368
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,026
Thirty-five years to the day
after our first marriage.

369
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:23,479
- I went through his pockets, Okay?
- Why would you wanna go through his pockets?

370
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:24,512
You know what I found?

371
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:25,214
No, what?

372
00:23:25,407 --> 00:23:27,084
They just bought a dining room table.

373
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,275
He and his wife just went out and spent
$1,600 on a dining room table.

374
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:33,375
- Where?
- The point isn't where, Alice.

375
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:35,654
The point is, he's never gonna leave her.

376
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,092
So what else is new.
You've known this for two years.

377
00:23:38,442 --> 00:23:40,761
You're right. You're right.
I know you're right.

378
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:42,279
Why can't you find someone single?

379
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:44,842
When I was single,
I knew lots of nice single men.

380
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,391
There must be someone.

381
00:23:46,723 --> 00:23:49,809
- Sally found someone.
- Well, Sally got the last good one.

382
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:51,568
Joe and I broke up.

383
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:52,310
What?

384
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:53,820
- When?
- Monday.

385
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,258
- You waited three days to tell us?
- You mean Joe's available?

386
00:23:56,357 --> 00:23:57,581
For God's sakes, Marie!

387
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:00,580
Don't you have any feelings about this?
She's obviously upset.

388
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,653
I'm not that upset. We've been
growing apart for quite a while.

389
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:06,867
But you guys were a couple.
You had someone to go places with.

390
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:09,249
You had a date on national holidays!

391
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,078
I said to myself, "You deserve more
than this. You're thirty-one years old."

392
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:14,321
And the clock is ticking.

393
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:17,099
No, the clock doesn't really start
to tick until you're thirty-six.

394
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:19,937
God, you're in such great shape.

395
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,288
Well, I've had a few days to
get used to it, and I feel okay.

396
00:24:24,361 --> 00:24:26,591
Good. Then you're ready.

397
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:31,184
- Really, Marie!
- Well, how else do you think you do it?

398
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:32,467
I've got the perfect guy.

399
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:35,063
I don't happen to find him
attractive, but you might.

400
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:37,218
She doesn't have a problem with chins.

401
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,313
Marie, I'm not ready yet.

402
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:41,233
but you just said you were over him.

403
00:24:41,368 --> 00:24:44,714
I am over him, but I'm in a mourning period.

404
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,316
Who is it?

405
00:24:48,385 --> 00:24:49,599
Alex Anderson.

406
00:24:51,145 --> 00:24:53,357
You fixed me up with him six years ago.

407
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:54,553
Uh, sorry.

408
00:24:55,492 --> 00:24:57,621
God. All right. Wait. Here.

409
00:24:57,672 --> 00:24:59,955
Here we go. Ken Darman.

410
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:02,653
He's been married for over a year.

411
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,166
Really?

412
00:25:05,022 --> 00:25:06,582
Married.

413
00:25:07,337 --> 00:25:09,555
- Oh, wait. Wait. I got one.
- Look,

414
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,608
there is no point in my going out
with someone I might really like,

415
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:15,509
if I met him at the right time,
but who right now has no chance

416
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,867
of being anything to me but a transitional man.

417
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:18,652
Okay.

418
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:20,623
But don't wait too long.

419
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:22,752
Remember what happened with David Warsaw?

420
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:25,595
His wife left him and everyone
said "Give him some time."

421
00:25:25,621 --> 00:25:27,413
"Don't move in too fast."

422
00:25:27,757 --> 00:25:29,786
Six months later, he was dead.

423
00:25:30,532 --> 00:25:33,998
What? You're saying I should get married to
someone right away in case he's about to die?

424
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,247
At least you could say you were married.

425
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:40,156
I'm saying that the right man for you
might be out there right now.

426
00:25:40,218 --> 00:25:42,090
And if you don't grab him, someone else will.

427
00:25:42,153 --> 00:25:44,748
And you'll spend the rest of
your life knowing that someone else

428
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:46,706
is married to your husband.

429
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:52,038
Ten!

430
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:53,430
Hut!

431
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,079
When did this happen?

432
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:10,193
Friday.

433
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:12,893
Helen comes home from work, and she says,

434
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:15,275
"I don't know if I wanna be married anymore."

435
00:26:15,581 --> 00:26:18,015
Like it's the institution.
You know, like it's nothing personal,

436
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:21,047
just something she's been
thinking about in a casual way.

437
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:22,842
I'm calm. I say,

438
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:25,920
"Why don't we take some time to think about it?
You know, don't rush into anything."

439
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:26,761
Yeah, right.

440
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:31,014
Next day, she says she's thought about it
and she wants a trial separation.

441
00:26:31,182 --> 00:26:34,036
She just wants to try it,
she says, but we can still date.

442
00:26:34,238 --> 00:26:36,020
Like this is supposed to cushion the blow.

443
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,961
I mean, I got married so I could stop dating.

444
00:26:38,052 --> 00:26:40,597
So I don't see where we can
still date is any big incentive

445
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,756
since the last thing you
wanna do is date your wife

446
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:45,105
who's supposed to love you,
which is what I'm saying to her

447
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:47,713
when it occurs to me that maybe she doesn't.

448
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:50,985
So I say to her, "Don't you love me anymore?"

449
00:26:51,062 --> 00:26:54,264
Do you know what she says?
"I don't know if I've ever loved you."

450
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:55,658
Oooh! That's harsh.

451
00:26:57,094 --> 00:26:58,766
You don't bounce back from that right away.

452
00:26:58,832 --> 00:26:59,690
Thanks, Jess.

453
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,527
No, I'm a writer. I know dialogue.
And that's particularly harsh.

454
00:27:03,683 --> 00:27:07,092
Then she tells me that somebody in
her office is going to South America,

455
00:27:07,124 --> 00:27:08,799
and she can sublet his apartment.

456
00:27:08,832 --> 00:27:11,368
I can't believe this. And the doorbell rings.

457
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:13,034
"I can sublet his apartment."

458
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:14,618
The words are still hanging in the air,

459
00:27:14,723 --> 00:27:16,606
You know, like in a balloon
attached to a mouth...

460
00:27:16,632 --> 00:27:18,039
- Like in a cartoon.
- Right.

461
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:21,084
So I go to the door,
and there are moving men there.

462
00:27:21,276 --> 00:27:22,915
Now I start to get suspicious.

463
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:25,385
I say, "Helen, when did you call these movers?"

464
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:27,155
And she doesn't say anything.

465
00:27:27,325 --> 00:27:30,001
So I ask the movers, "When did
this woman book you for this gig?"

466
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,111
And they're just standing there,
three huge guys,

467
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:35,229
one of them wearing a T-shirt that says,
"Don't fuck with Mr. Zero."

468
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:38,669
So I said, "Helen, when did
you make this arrangement?"

469
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:41,203
She says, "A week ago."

470
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:44,098
I said, "You've known for a week,
and you didn't tell me?"

471
00:27:44,272 --> 00:27:47,283
And she says, "I didn't want
to ruin your birthday."

472
00:27:50,246 --> 00:27:53,485
You're saying Mr. Zero knew you were
getting a divorce a week before you did?

473
00:27:53,511 --> 00:27:55,307
- Mr. Zero knew.
- I can't believe this.

474
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:59,179
- I haven't told you the bad part yet.
- What could be worse than Mr. Zero knowing?

475
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:01,630
It's all a lie.

476
00:28:02,626 --> 00:28:04,579
She's in love with somebody else.

477
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:08,042
Some tax attorney. She moved in with him.

478
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:10,189
How did you find out?

479
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,999
I followed her. I stood outside the building.

480
00:28:13,294 --> 00:28:15,945
- So humiliating.
- Tell me about it.

481
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,866
And, you know, I knew.

482
00:28:17,978 --> 00:28:20,940
I knew the whole time that even though
we were happy, it was just an illusion,

483
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:23,081
and that one day she would
kick the shit out of me.

484
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:26,378
Marriages don't break up
on account of infidelity.

485
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:28,892
It's just a symptom
that something else is wrong.

486
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,375
Oh, really?
Well, that symptom is fucking my wife.

487
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,877
So I just happened to see
his American Express bill.

488
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:43,162
What do you mean
you "just happened to see it"?

489
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,241
Well, he was shaving,
and there it was, in his briefcase.

490
00:28:47,489 --> 00:28:49,974
What if he came out and saw you
looking through his briefcase?

491
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,943
You're missing the point.
I'm telling you what I found.

492
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:57,937
He just spent $120
on a new nightgown for his wife.

493
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:01,342
I don't think he's ever gonna leave her.

494
00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:04,249
No one thinks he's ever gonna leave her.

495
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,938
You're right. You're right. I know you're right.

496
00:29:22,653 --> 00:29:25,918
Someone is staring at you in Personal Growth.

497
00:29:28,946 --> 00:29:30,379
I know him.

498
00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:32,490
You'd like him. He's married.

499
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:34,676
Who is he?

500
00:29:34,715 --> 00:29:37,142
Harry Burns. He's a political consultant.

501
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,202
He's cute.

502
00:29:39,523 --> 00:29:42,470
- You think he's cute?
- How do you know he's married?

503
00:29:42,904 --> 00:29:44,945
'Cause last time I saw him
he was getting married.

504
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,994
- When was that?
- Six years ago.

505
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:50,987
So he might not be married anymore.

506
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:53,025
Also, he's obnoxious.

507
00:29:53,103 --> 00:29:55,528
Oh, this is just like in the movies, remeber?

508
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,147
in "The Lady Vanishes" when she says to me,
"You're the most obnoxious man..."

509
00:29:58,173 --> 00:29:59,200
"The most contemptible."

510
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,076
Then they fall madly in love.

511
00:30:01,203 --> 00:30:03,802
- Also, he never remembers me.
- Sally Albright.

512
00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:08,615
- Hi, Harry.
- I thought it was you.

513
00:30:08,697 --> 00:30:11,427
It is. Yeah. This is Marie.

514
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,719
- Was Marie.
- How are you?

515
00:30:15,972 --> 00:30:17,798
- Fine.
- How's Joe?

516
00:30:18,462 --> 00:30:21,226
Fine. I hear he's fine.

517
00:30:22,203 --> 00:30:23,761
You're not with Joe anymore?

518
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,741
We just broke up.

519
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:29,512
I'm sorry. That's too bad.

520
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,306
Yeah. Well, you know.

521
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:33,834
Yeah.

522
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:37,326
So, what about you?

523
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:39,914
- I'm fine.
- How's married life?

524
00:30:41,815 --> 00:30:44,909
Not so good. I'm getting a divorce.

525
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:46,606
Oh, I'm sorry.

526
00:30:47,257 --> 00:30:48,842
I'm really sorry.

527
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:51,877
Yeah. Well, what are you gonna do?

528
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,259
What happened with you guys?

529
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:58,091
When Joe and I started seeing each
other, we wanted exactly the same thing.

530
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:01,000
We wanted to live together
but we didn't wanna get married

531
00:31:01,032 --> 00:31:04,412
because every time anyone we knew got
married, it ruined their relationship.

532
00:31:04,516 --> 00:31:06,535
They practically never had sex again.

533
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:08,276
It's true.

534
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:10,795
It's one of the secrets
that no one ever tells you.

535
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:13,528
I would sit around with my
girlfriends who have kids, and...

536
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,630
actually, my one girlfriend who has kids, Alice.

537
00:31:16,718 --> 00:31:20,525
And she would complain about how
she and Gary never did it anymore.

538
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:24,441
She didn't even complain about it now that I
think about it. She just said it matter-of-factly.

539
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:28,010
She said they were up all night,
they were both exhausted all the time,

540
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:31,328
the kids just took every
sexual impulse they had outta them.

541
00:31:33,648 --> 00:31:36,353
Joe and I used to talk about it
and we'd say we're so lucky.

542
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:38,471
We have this wonderful relationship.

543
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:42,874
We can have sex on the kitchen floor
and not worry about the kids walking in.

544
00:31:42,946 --> 00:31:46,057
We can fly off to Rome on a moment's notice.

545
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:51,025
And then one day I was taking Alice's
little girl for the afternoon,

546
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,974
because I promised to take her to the circus.

547
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:56,619
And we were in the cab playing "I Spy."

548
00:31:56,694 --> 00:31:59,528
"I spy a mailbox. I spy a lamp post."

549
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,848
And she looked out the window and
she saw this man and this woman,

550
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:04,878
with these two little kids,

551
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:07,825
and the man had one of
the kids on his shoulders.

552
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:11,866
And she said, "I spy a family."

553
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:14,800
And I started to cry.

554
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:17,418
You know, I just started crying.

555
00:32:18,682 --> 00:32:20,673
And I went home, and I said...

556
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:24,710
"The thing is, Joe, we never do fly off
to Rome on a moment's notice."

557
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:26,653
And the kitchen floor?

558
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:28,418
Not once.

559
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:32,149
It's this very cold, hard Mexican ceramic tile.

560
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:37,735
Anyway, we talked about it for a long time,

561
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:39,285
and I said, "This is what I want."

562
00:32:39,311 --> 00:32:41,133
And he said, "Well, I don't."

563
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:45,115
And I said, "Well, I guess
it's over." And he left.

564
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:51,711
And the thing is, I feel really fine.

565
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:55,112
I am over him. I mean, I really am over him.

566
00:32:55,185 --> 00:32:58,552
That was it for him.
That was the most that he could give.

567
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:03,075
And every time I think about it, I am more
and more convinced that I did the right thing.

568
00:33:03,704 --> 00:33:05,615
Boy, you sound really healthy.

569
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:07,630
Yeah.

570
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:11,669
- At least I got the apartment.
- That's what everybody says to me too.

571
00:33:11,827 --> 00:33:14,026
But, really, what's so hard
about finding an apartment?

572
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:16,521
What you do is you read the obituary column.

573
00:33:17,003 --> 00:33:20,152
You find out who died, go to the
building and then you tip the doorman.

574
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:22,894
What they could do to make it easier
is combine the obituaries

575
00:33:22,949 --> 00:33:24,274
with the real estate section.

576
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:27,895
Say then you have, "Mr. Klein died today,
leaving a wife, two children,

577
00:33:27,968 --> 00:33:31,960
and a spacious three-bedroom apartment
with a wood-burning fireplace." See?

578
00:33:35,518 --> 00:33:38,351
You know, the first time we met,
I really didn't like you that much.

579
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:40,318
- I didn't like you.
- Yeah, you did.

580
00:33:40,388 --> 00:33:43,234
You were just so uptight then.
You're much softer now.

581
00:33:43,996 --> 00:33:45,594
You know, I hate that kind of remark.

582
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:48,115
It sounds like a compliment,
but really it's an insult.

583
00:33:48,272 --> 00:33:50,286
Okay, you're still as hard as nails.

584
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:52,917
I just didn't want to sleep with you,
and you had to write it off

585
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:55,455
as a character flaw instead of
dealing with the possibility

586
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:58,056
that it might have something to do with you.

587
00:33:59,656 --> 00:34:02,682
What's the statute of limitations on apologies?

588
00:34:04,446 --> 00:34:08,041
- Ten years.
- Oh, I can just get it in under the wire.

589
00:34:12,773 --> 00:34:15,224
Would you like to have dinner with me sometime?

590
00:34:16,107 --> 00:34:18,167
Are we becoming friends now?

591
00:34:19,928 --> 00:34:21,361
Well...

592
00:34:22,882 --> 00:34:24,049
yeah.

593
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,465
Great. A woman friend.

594
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,415
You know, you may be the first attractive woman

595
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:34,316
I've not wanted to sleep with in my entire life.

596
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,569
That's wonderful, Harry.

597
00:34:38,604 --> 00:34:41,670
- We were both born in the same hospital.
- In 1921.

598
00:34:41,853 --> 00:34:44,324
- Seven days apart.
- In the same hospital.

599
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:47,595
- We both grew up one block away from each other.
- We both lived in tenements.

600
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,444
- On the Lower East Side.
- On Delancey Street.

601
00:34:50,644 --> 00:34:53,867
- My family moved to the Bronx when I was ten.
- He lived on Fordham Road.

602
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:57,055
- Hers moved when she was 11.
- I lived on 183rd Street.

603
00:34:57,123 --> 00:35:02,158
- For six years, She worked on the 15th floor, as a nurse,
- I worked for a very prominent neurologist,

604
00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:06,184
- where I had a practice on the
14th floor of the very same building.
- Dr. Permelman.

605
00:35:06,255 --> 00:35:08,029
- We never met.
- Never met.

606
00:35:08,185 --> 00:35:09,692
Can you imagine that?

607
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:11,148
You know where we met?

608
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:13,043
- In an elevator
- I was visiting family.

609
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,439
- In the Ambassador Hotel in Chicago.
- He was on the third floor.

610
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:17,624
I was on the 12th.

611
00:35:17,651 --> 00:35:21,305
I rode up nine extra floors
just to keep talking to her.

612
00:35:21,514 --> 00:35:23,505
Nine extra floors.

613
00:35:34,093 --> 00:35:36,581
- Hello.
- You sleeping?

614
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:38,625
No, I was watching Casablanca.

615
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:39,598
Channel, please.

616
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,246
Eleven.

617
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:42,460
Thank you. Got it.

618
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:46,639
... that you're telling me you would be happier
with Victor Laszlo than with Humphrey Bogart?

619
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,969
- When did I say that?
- When we drove to New York.

620
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:52,169
I never said that. I would never have said that.

621
00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:54,474
All right, fine. Have it your way.

622
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,408
- Have you been sleeping?
- Why?

623
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,315
'Cause I haven't been sleeping.

624
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:02,746
I really miss Helen.

625
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:05,510
Maybe I'm coming down with something.

626
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:09,226
Last night I was up at fur in the morning,
watching "Leave It To Beaver" in Spanish.

627
00:36:13,476 --> 00:36:14,531
I'm not well.

628
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:18,536
Well, I went to bed at 7:30 last night.
I haven't done that since the 3rd grade.

629
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,305
Well, that's the good thing
about depression. You get your rest.

631
00:36:22,006 --> 00:36:25,001
- I'm not depressed.
- Okay, fine.

632
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:27,874
Do you still sleep on
the same side of the bed?

633
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:30,759
I did for a while, but now I'm
pretty much using the whole bed.

634
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:32,678
God, that's great.

635
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:35,811
I feel weird when just my leg wanders over.

636
00:36:36,472 --> 00:36:38,230
I miss her.

637
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:42,419
- I don't miss him. I really don't.
- Not even a little?

638
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:44,463
You know what I miss?

639
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,251
I miss the idea of him.

640
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:51,637
Maybe I only miss the idea of Helen.

641
00:36:52,022 --> 00:36:54,013
No, I miss the whole Helen.

642
00:36:57,826 --> 00:36:59,521
Last scene.

643
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:06,242
Goodbye, Rick. I will miss you.

644
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:07,910
Ooh, Ingrid Bergman.

645
00:37:07,987 --> 00:37:10,512
- Now, she's low maintenance.
- Low maintenance?

646
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:14,116
There are two kinds of women,
high maintenance and low maintenance.

647
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:16,753
And Ingrid Bergman is low maintenance?

648
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:18,592
An LM, definitely.

649
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,925
- Which one am I?
- You're the worst kind.

650
00:37:20,957 --> 00:37:23,728
You're high maintenance,
but you think you're low maintenance.

651
00:37:23,894 --> 00:37:26,109
- I don't see that.
- You don't see that?

652
00:37:26,236 --> 00:37:29,339
"Waiter, I'll begin with the house salad
but I don't want the regular dressing.

653
00:37:29,408 --> 00:37:31,933
I'll have the Balsamic vinegar
and oil but on the side.

654
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:35,378
And then the salmon with the mustard sauce,
but I want the sauce on the side."

655
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,318
"On the side" is a very big thing for you.

656
00:37:37,574 --> 00:37:39,335
Well, I just want it the way I want it.

657
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,213
I know, high maintenance.

658
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:41,479
- Oh, I just want it the way I want it.
- I know. High maintenance.

659
00:37:41,915 --> 00:37:44,819
That 10,000 francs should pay our expenses.

660
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,915
- "Our" expenses?
- Mm hmm.

661
00:37:46,992 --> 00:37:51,520
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

662
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:56,479
Best last line of a movie ever.

663
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:01,202
I'm definitely coming down with something.

664
00:38:01,273 --> 00:38:03,707
Probably a 24-hour tumor. They're going around.

665
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,619
- You don't have a tumor.
- How do you know?

666
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:07,920
If you're so worried, go see a doctor.

667
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:10,807
No, he'll just tell me it's nothing.

668
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,699
- Will you be able to sleep?
- If not, I'll be okay.

669
00:38:13,802 --> 00:38:16,906
- What'll you do?
- I'll stay up and moan.

670
00:38:17,122 --> 00:38:19,056
Maybe I should practice now.

671
00:38:25,297 --> 00:38:26,889
Good night, Harry.

672
00:38:28,051 --> 00:38:29,575
Good night.

673
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:09,968
Had my dream again where I'm making love
and the Olympic judges are watching.

674
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:12,806
I'd nailed the compulsories.
So this is it, the finals.

675
00:39:12,878 --> 00:39:16,473
I got a 9.8 from the Canadian,
a perfect 10 from the American...

676
00:39:16,548 --> 00:39:20,075
and my mother, disguised as an
East German judge, gave me a 5.6.

677
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:22,518
Must have been the dismount.

678
00:39:22,892 --> 00:39:25,921
Basically, it's the same one I've
been having since I was twelve.

679
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:28,858
- What happens?
- No, it's... it's too embarrassing.

680
00:39:28,927 --> 00:39:31,418
- Don't tell me.
- Okay, there's this guy.

681
00:39:31,497 --> 00:39:33,522
- What's he look like?
- I don't know.

682
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,864
- He's just kind of faceless.
- Faceless guy. Okay. Then what?

683
00:39:38,635 --> 00:39:40,665
He rips off my clothes.

684
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:42,604
Then what happens?

685
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:44,283
That's it.

686
00:39:45,612 --> 00:39:46,710
That's it?

687
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,747
A faceless guy rips off your clothes,

688
00:39:48,814 --> 00:39:51,442
and that's the sex fantasy you've
been having since you were twelve?

689
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:52,950
Exactly the same?

690
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:55,473
Well, sometimes I vary it a little.

691
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:58,379
- Which part?
- What I'm wearing.

692
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:05,462
- What?
- Nothing.

693
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:11,346
I have decided that for the rest of the day,

694
00:40:11,394 --> 00:40:14,036
we are going to talk like this.

695
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,539
- Like this?
- No.

696
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:17,598
Please to repeat after me.

697
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:19,371
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

698
00:40:21,891 --> 00:40:26,021
Waiter, there is too much
pepper on my paprikash.

699
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,653
Waiter, there is too much pepper

700
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:31,019
on my paprikash.

701
00:40:31,248 --> 00:40:34,217
But I would be proud
to partake of your pecan pie.

702
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:36,337
Oh, no!

703
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:37,728
But I would be proud...

704
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:38,601
But I would be proud

705
00:40:38,742 --> 00:40:39,730
to partake

706
00:40:39,798 --> 00:40:42,926
of your pecan pie.

707
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:44,662
Pecan pie.

708
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,374
Would you like to go
to the movies with me tonight?

709
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:54,578
Not to repeat. Please, to answer.

710
00:40:54,757 --> 00:40:58,193
Would you like to go
to the movies with me tonight?

711
00:40:58,392 --> 00:40:59,971
Oh, Oh.

712
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:02,353
Well, I'd love to, Harry, but I can't.

713
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:05,749
What, do you have a hot date?

714
00:41:05,824 --> 00:41:07,679
Well, yeah. Yeah.

715
00:41:07,753 --> 00:41:08,762
- Really?
- Yeah.

716
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,788
I was gonna tell you about it, but I
don't know, I just, I felt strange about it.

717
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:15,355
- Why?
- Well, because we've been
spending so much time together.

718
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:17,814
Oh, I think it's great that you have a date.

719
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,988
- You do?
- Yeah.

720
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:29,265
- Is that what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

721
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:32,815
Well, I don't know. Why?

722
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:36,921
I think you should wear skirts more.
You look really good in skirts.

723
00:41:37,274 --> 00:41:39,028
- I do?
- Yeah.

724
00:41:41,275 --> 00:41:42,816
You know, I have a theory that hieroglyphics

725
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:46,271
are really an ancient comic strip
about a character named Sphinxy.

726
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:48,465
You know, Harry,
I think you should get out there too.

727
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:51,297
- Oh, I'm not ready.
- You should.

728
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:53,930
I would not be good for anybody right now.

729
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:55,413
It's time.

730
00:41:55,874 --> 00:41:59,207
It was the most uncomfortable night of my life.

731
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:01,841
See, now, it has to go this way.

732
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,394
The first date back
is always the toughest, Harry.

733
00:42:05,497 --> 00:42:07,415
You only had one date.

734
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:09,772
How do you know it's not gonna get worse?

735
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:12,161
How much worse can it get
than finishing dinner,

736
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:16,510
having him reach over, pull a hair out of my
head and start flossing with it at the table?

737
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:19,551
We're talking dream date
compared to my horror.

738
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:23,301
It started out fine.
She's a very nice person.

739
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:27,082
And we're sitting, and we're at this
Ethiopian restaurant that she wanted to go to.

740
00:42:27,246 --> 00:42:30,846
And I was making jokes, you know, like "Hey,
I didn't know that they had food in Ethiopia.

741
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:34,570
This'll be a quick meal. I'll order
two empty plates and we can leave."

742
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:37,010
Yeah. Nothing from her, not even a smile.

743
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:40,116
I downshift into small talk,
and I ask her where she went to school.

744
00:42:40,193 --> 00:42:41,956
And she says Michigan State,

745
00:42:42,028 --> 00:42:43,897
and this reminds me of Helen.

746
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:47,124
All of a sudden I'm in the middle
of this massive anxiety attack.

747
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,135
My heart's beating like a wild man,
and I start sweating like a pig.

748
00:42:50,297 --> 00:42:51,640
Helen went to Michigan State?

749
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:55,638
No, she went to Northwestern,
but they're both Big Ten schools.

750
00:42:55,802 --> 00:42:58,356
I got so upset, I had to leave the restaurant.

751
00:43:00,964 --> 00:43:03,262
Harry, I think this takes a long time.

752
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:07,677
It might be months before we're actually
able to enjoy going out with someone new.

753
00:43:07,844 --> 00:43:08,659
Yeah.

754
00:43:08,738 --> 00:43:12,237
And maybe longer before we're actually
able to go to bed with someone new.

755
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:14,183
Oh, I went to bed with her.

756
00:43:16,108 --> 00:43:18,542
- You went to bed with her?
- Sure.

757
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:20,635
Oh.

758
00:43:24,892 --> 00:43:26,787
I don't understand this relationship.

759
00:43:26,943 --> 00:43:27,806
What do you mean?

760
00:43:27,886 --> 00:43:29,633
- You enjoy being with her?
- Yeah.

761
00:43:29,713 --> 00:43:31,811
- You find her attractive?
- Yeah.

762
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:33,991
- And you're not sleeping with her?
- No.

763
00:43:34,054 --> 00:43:36,412
You're afraid to let yourself be happy.

764
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:39,975
Why can't you give me credit for this?
This is a big thing for me.

765
00:43:40,308 --> 00:43:43,016
I've never had a relationship
with a woman that didn't involve sex.

766
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:45,524
- I feel like I'm growing.
- Are you finished?

767
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:48,026
Hey, I got a whole stack of
quarters and I was here first.

768
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,760
- Were not!
- Was too!

769
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:52,796
- Big jerk.
- Little creep.

770
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:55,550
- Where was I?
- You were growing.

771
00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:57,302
Yeah.

772
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,197
It's very freeing.

773
00:43:59,272 --> 00:44:01,206
I can say anything to her.

774
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:04,243
Are you saying you can say
things to her you can't say to me?

775
00:44:04,712 --> 00:44:07,391
No, it's just different.
It's a whole different perspective.

776
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:09,668
I get the woman's point of view on things.

777
00:44:09,918 --> 00:44:13,545
She tells me about the men that she goes out with,
and I can talk to her about the women I see.

778
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,793
- You tell her about other women?
- Yeah.

779
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:19,657
Like the other night, I made love to
this woman, and it was so incredible,

780
00:44:19,753 --> 00:44:21,493
I took her to a place that wasn't human.

781
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:22,974
She actually meowed.

782
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,431
- You made a woman meow?
- Yeah.

783
00:44:25,472 --> 00:44:28,263
That's the point.
I can say these things to her.

784
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:30,360
And the great thing is, I don't have to lie

785
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:32,701
because I'm not always thinking
about how to get her into bed.

786
00:44:32,772 --> 00:44:34,330
I can just be myself.

787
00:44:34,873 --> 00:44:37,501
You made a woman meow?

788
00:44:38,238 --> 00:44:41,155
What do you do with these women?
You just get up out of bed and leave?

789
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:41,732
Sure.

790
00:44:42,186 --> 00:44:44,625
Well, explain to me how you do it.
What do you say?

791
00:44:44,651 --> 00:44:47,279
I say I have an early meeting,
early haircut, early squash game.

792
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:50,608
- You don't play squash.
- They don't know that. They just met me.

793
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:54,285
- That's disgusting.
- I know. I feel terrible.

794
00:44:54,703 --> 00:44:57,111
You know, I'm so glad
I never got involved with you.

795
00:44:57,297 --> 00:44:58,884
I just would have ended up being some woman

796
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:02,821
you had to get up out of bed and leave
at 3:00 a.m. and go clean your andirons.

797
00:45:03,019 --> 00:45:06,002
And you don't even have a fireplace.
Not that I would know this.

798
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:08,459
Why are you getting so upset?
This is not about you.

799
00:45:08,578 --> 00:45:09,652
Yes, it is.

800
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,751
You are a human affront to all women,
and I am a woman.

801
00:45:12,902 --> 00:45:15,780
Hey, I don't feel great about this,
but I don't hear anyone complaining.

802
00:45:15,987 --> 00:45:18,340
Of course not. You're out the door too fast.

803
00:45:18,834 --> 00:45:20,757
I think they have an okay time.

804
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,405
How do you know?

805
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:24,574
What d'ya mean how do I know? I know.

806
00:45:25,148 --> 00:45:26,615
Because they...

807
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:29,184
Yes, because they...

808
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:31,763
How do you know that they're really...

809
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:34,907
What are you saying? That they fake orgasm?

810
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,618
- It's possible.
- Get outta here.

811
00:45:37,656 --> 00:45:40,945
Why? Most women, at one time
or another, have faked it.

812
00:45:41,267 --> 00:45:44,272
- Well, They haven't faked it with me.
- How do you know?

813
00:45:45,445 --> 00:45:47,072
Because I know.

814
00:45:48,555 --> 00:45:49,420
Oh.

815
00:45:50,116 --> 00:45:51,811
Right. That's right.

816
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:54,285
I forgot. You're a man.

817
00:45:54,354 --> 00:45:56,435
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

818
00:45:56,578 --> 00:46:00,575
It's just that all men are sure it never
happened to them, and most women at one time
or another have done it.

819
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:01,826
So you do the math.

820
00:46:02,776 --> 00:46:04,830
You don't think that I can tell the difference?

821
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:06,239
No.

822
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:08,324
Get outta here.

823
00:46:14,497 --> 00:46:15,902
 

824
00:46:17,263 --> 00:46:18,763
 

825
00:46:20,148 --> 00:46:21,505
 

826
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,294
Are you okay?

827
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,430
 

828
00:46:28,421 --> 00:46:30,412
 

829
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:33,557
 

830
00:46:34,094 --> 00:46:35,213
 

831
00:46:36,342 --> 00:46:37,731
 

832
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,021
 

833
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,515
 

834
00:46:43,336 --> 00:46:44,951
Oh, yeah, right there.

835
00:46:45,226 --> 00:46:45,933
 

836
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:48,838
 

837
00:46:48,943 --> 00:46:50,236
 

838
00:46:50,342 --> 00:46:51,533
 

839
00:46:51,672 --> 00:46:53,037
 

840
00:46:53,223 --> 00:46:54,011
 

841
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:55,042
Yes!

842
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,077
Yes!

843
00:46:56,201 --> 00:46:57,130
Yes!

844
00:46:59,965 --> 00:47:00,814
 

845
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:01,863
 

846
00:47:02,246 --> 00:47:03,531
Oh, yes!

847
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,774
Oh, God!

848
00:47:18,445 --> 00:47:19,850
 

849
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:30,212
I'll have what she's having.

850
00:47:32,028 --> 00:47:33,984
 

851
00:47:34,156 --> 00:47:35,863
 

852
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:40,272
 

853
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,199
 

854
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:45,505
 

855
00:47:45,548 --> 00:47:48,729
 

856
00:47:49,101 --> 00:47:52,784
 

857
00:47:53,444 --> 00:47:57,215
 

858
00:47:58,555 --> 00:48:02,325
 

859
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:06,150
 

860
00:48:06,903 --> 00:48:10,733
 

861
00:48:11,395 --> 00:48:15,073
 

862
00:48:15,774 --> 00:48:17,360
 

863
00:48:17,386 --> 00:48:19,899
 

864
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:23,918
 

865
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:28,299
 

866
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:32,322
 

867
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:37,275
 

868
00:48:37,772 --> 00:48:40,979
 

869
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:45,185
 

870
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:48,272
 

871
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:54,204
 

872
00:48:54,315 --> 00:48:56,354
I like you without your beard.
You can see your face.

873
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,383
Yeah, it is my face.

874
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,000
Wow, I'm dipping you.

875
00:49:04,422 --> 00:49:06,560
I really want to thank you
for taking me out tonight.

876
00:49:06,586 --> 00:49:07,658
Oh, don't be silly.

877
00:49:07,684 --> 00:49:10,285
The next New Year's Eve,
if neither one of us is with anybody,

878
00:49:10,311 --> 00:49:11,657
you got a date.

879
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:13,229
Deal.

880
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:17,026
See? Now we can dance cheek to cheek.

881
00:49:20,547 --> 00:49:23,010
 

882
00:49:23,247 --> 00:49:26,542
 

883
00:49:27,954 --> 00:49:32,733
 

884
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,539
 

885
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:40,804
 

886
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:42,667
 

887
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:47,017
Hey, everybody, ten seconds to New Year!

888
00:49:47,086 --> 00:49:49,452
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Wanna get some air?

889
00:49:49,522 --> 00:49:51,149
- Yeah.
- Seven, six...

890
00:49:51,224 --> 00:49:52,919
five, four...

891
00:49:52,992 --> 00:49:55,227
three, two, one!

892
00:49:55,315 --> 00:49:56,805
Happy New Year!

893
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,166
Happy New Year!

894
00:50:05,262 --> 00:50:09,714
Should old acquaintance be forgot

895
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:14,569
And never brought to mind

896
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:19,741
Should old acquaintance be forgot

897
00:50:20,515 --> 00:50:25,747
And days of auld lang syne

898
00:50:28,387 --> 00:50:30,830
Well, he was the head counselor
at the boys' camp,

899
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:33,625
and I was the head counselor
at the girls' camp.

900
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:37,559
And they had a social one night,
and he walked across the room.

901
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:40,795
I thought he was coming
to talk to my friend Maxine,

902
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:44,577
'cause people were always
crossing rooms to talk to Maxine.

903
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:47,709
But he was coming to talk to me, and he said,

904
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:50,771
"I'm Ben Small of the Coney Island Smalls."

905
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:52,484
At that moment, I knew.

906
00:50:52,587 --> 00:50:55,481
I knew the way you know about a good melon.

907
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,974
You sent flowers to yourself?

908
00:51:00,397 --> 00:51:03,581
Sixty dollars I spent on this big,
stupid arrangement of flowers

909
00:51:03,607 --> 00:51:05,743
and I wrote a card that I planned
to leave on the front table

910
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:08,094
where Arthur would just happen to see it.

911
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,306
What did the card say?

912
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:13,277
"Please say yes. Love, Jonathan."

913
00:51:13,467 --> 00:51:15,827
- Did it work?
- He never even came over.

914
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:18,671
He forgot this charity thing
that his wife is the chairman of.

915
00:51:18,697 --> 00:51:20,938
- He's never gonna leave her!
- Of course he isn't.

916
00:51:20,964 --> 00:51:24,510
You're right. I know you're right.
Where is this place?

917
00:51:24,643 --> 00:51:26,360
Somewhere in the next block.

918
00:51:26,404 --> 00:51:29,083
Uh! I can't believe I'm doing this.

919
00:51:29,258 --> 00:51:32,850
Look, Harry is one of my best friends,
and you are one of my best friends.

920
00:51:33,026 --> 00:51:35,991
If by some chance you two hit it off,
then we can all still be friends,

921
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,693
instead of drifting apart

922
00:51:37,752 --> 00:51:40,237
the way you do when you get involved with
someone who doesn't know your friends.

923
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,366
You and I haven't drifted apart
since I started seeing Arthur.

924
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:48,472
If Arthur ever left his wife
and I actually met him,

925
00:51:48,498 --> 00:51:51,745
I am sure that you and I would drift apart.

926
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:54,036
He's never gonna leave her.

927
00:51:54,317 --> 00:51:56,275
Of course he isn't.

928
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:58,711
You're right. You're right.
I know you're right.

929
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:01,308
- I don't know about this.
- It's just a dinner.

930
00:52:01,386 --> 00:52:03,331
You know, I've finally got to
a little place in my life.

931
00:52:03,395 --> 00:52:06,489
where I'm comfortable with the fact
that it's just me and my work.

932
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:08,451
If she's so great,
why aren't you taking her out?

933
00:52:08,477 --> 00:52:10,834
How many times do I have to tell you?
We're just friends.

934
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:13,826
- So you're saying she's not that attractive?
- No, I told you she is attractive.

935
00:52:13,852 --> 00:52:15,695
Yeah, but you also said
she had a good personality.

936
00:52:15,721 --> 00:52:17,834
She has a good personality.

937
00:52:20,105 --> 00:52:21,321
What?

938
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:23,340
When someone's not that attractive,

939
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:26,116
they're always described
as having a good personality.

940
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:28,083
Look, if you would asked me,
"What does she look like?"

941
00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:31,510
 and I said, "She has a good personality,"
that means she's not attractive.

942
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:34,346
But just because I happened to mention
that she has a good personality,

943
00:52:34,419 --> 00:52:35,519
she could be either.

944
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,212
She could be attractive with a good personality,

945
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:39,153
or not attractive with a good personality.

946
00:52:39,224 --> 00:52:41,215
- So which one is she?
- Attractive.

947
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,464
But not beautiful, right?

948
00:52:46,386 --> 00:52:48,463
It's like whenever I read Jimmy Breslin,

949
00:52:48,675 --> 00:52:51,874
it's as if he's leaving
some kind of a wake-up call

950
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,000
for the City of New York, you know.

951
00:52:54,072 --> 00:52:56,195
I'm sorry. What do you mean by a wake-up call?

952
00:52:56,221 --> 00:52:58,875
Oh, he's saying we've actually
got people in the city...

953
00:53:00,768 --> 00:53:01,490
An art director.

954
00:53:01,571 --> 00:53:03,568
Would I have seen any of your windows?

955
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:07,944
Did you see this Barney's stand a couple of
weeks ago. I did a thing with hostages.

956
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:10,112
- Uh, The people in blindfolds.
- Yeah.

957
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:12,622
- It's...
- I thought it was like late '80s.

958
00:53:12,972 --> 00:53:13,726
Uh huh.

959
00:53:13,779 --> 00:53:15,949
- It's macho. I don't think...
- That's interesting.

960
00:53:16,061 --> 00:53:19,242
Uh, Let's just say I'm really just
not a big fan of Jimmy Breslin.

961
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:22,959
Well, He's the reason I became a writer,
but that's not important.

962
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:40,247
Harry, you and Marie are both from New Jersey.

963
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:41,910
- Really?
- Where are you from?

964
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:43,578
- South Orange.
- Haddenfield.

965
00:53:43,647 --> 00:53:44,980
 

966
00:53:51,613 --> 00:53:53,127
So, what are we gonna order?

967
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:55,859
Well, I'm gonna start
with the grilled radicchio.

968
00:53:55,981 --> 00:53:57,449
Jess, Sally is a great orderer.

969
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:59,503
Not only does she always pick
the best thing on the menu,

970
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:02,664
but she orders it in a way that even the
chef didn't know how good it could be.

971
00:54:03,044 --> 00:54:05,011
I think restaurants have become too important.

972
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:06,208
Oh, I agree.

973
00:54:06,454 --> 00:54:10,476
"Restaurants are to people in the '80s
what theater was to people in the '60s."

974
00:54:10,776 --> 00:54:12,482
I read that in a magazine.

975
00:54:13,413 --> 00:54:15,212
I wrote that.

976
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,417
- Get outta here.
- No, I did. I wrote that.

977
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:21,142
I've never quoted anything
from a magazine in my life.

978
00:54:21,168 --> 00:54:21,944
That's amazing.

979
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,551
Don't you think that's amazing?
And you wrote it?

980
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,124
I also wrote, "Pesto is the quiche of the '80s."

981
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:30,963
- Get over yourself!
- I did!

982
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:33,652
- Where did I read that?
- New York magazine.

983
00:54:33,779 --> 00:54:35,571
Sally writes for New York magazine.

984
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,666
You know, that piece had a real impact on me.
I don't know that much about writing, but...

985
00:54:40,721 --> 00:54:43,035
Well, it spoke to you, and that pleases me.

986
00:54:43,061 --> 00:54:46,927
I mean, I really, you have to admire people
who can be that articulate...

987
00:54:46,977 --> 00:54:51,211
Nobody has ever quoted me back to me before.

988
00:54:59,995 --> 00:55:03,310
Oh, I've been looking for a red suede pump.

989
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:07,808
What do you think of Jess?

990
00:55:09,168 --> 00:55:12,160
- Well, ur...
- Do you think you could go out with him?

991
00:55:13,404 --> 00:55:16,979
- I don't know.
- 'Cause I feel really comfortable with him.

992
00:55:17,324 --> 00:55:20,706
- You wanna go out with Jess.
- If it would be all right with you.

993
00:55:20,741 --> 00:55:22,200
Sure, sure.

994
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:25,147
I'm just worried about Harry.
He's very sensitive.

995
00:55:25,173 --> 00:55:29,122
He's going through a rough period.
I just don't want you to reject him right now.

996
00:55:29,148 --> 00:55:31,353
- I wouldn't. I totally understand.
- Okay.

997
00:55:31,669 --> 00:55:34,846
If you don't think you're gonna call
Marie, do you mind if I call her?

998
00:55:35,066 --> 00:55:36,761
- No.
- Good, good, good.

999
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,930
But for tonight you shouldn't.
I mean, Sally's very vulnerable right now.

1000
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,052
Well, you can call Marie, it's fine,
but just like wait a week or so, you know?

1001
00:55:44,158 --> 00:55:46,272
- Don't make any moves tonight.
- Fine. No problem.

1002
00:55:46,298 --> 00:55:48,335
I wasn't even thinking about tonight.

1003
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:53,242
Well, I don't really feel much like
walking anymore. I think I'll get a cab.

1004
00:55:53,296 --> 00:55:54,756
- I'll go with you.
- Great!

1005
00:55:54,796 --> 00:55:56,409
Taxi!

1006
00:56:08,066 --> 00:56:10,461
A man came to me and said,

1007
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:13,697
"I found nice girl for you.

1008
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:18,037
She lives in the next village...

1009
00:56:18,244 --> 00:56:21,338
and she is ready for marriage."

1010
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:26,536
We were not supposed to meet until the wedding,

1011
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:28,914
but I wanted to make sure.

1012
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,586
So I sneak into her village,

1013
00:56:31,727 --> 00:56:33,533
hid behind a tree,

1014
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:36,587
watch her washing the clothes.

1015
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,121
I think if I don't like the way she looks,

1016
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,893
I don't marry her.

1017
00:56:43,242 --> 00:56:45,953
But she looked really nice to me.

1018
00:56:46,137 --> 00:56:49,244
So I said, "Okay," to the man.

1019
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:51,669
We get married.

1020
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:55,351
We're married for fifty-five years.

1021
00:57:02,206 --> 00:57:05,623
- I have to get this.
- Harry, we're here for Jess and Marie.

1022
00:57:05,664 --> 00:57:08,227
I know. We'll find them something.
There's great stuff here.

1023
00:57:08,253 --> 00:57:11,000
- We should've gone to the plant store.
- Here, perfect for them.

1024
00:57:11,157 --> 00:57:12,353
What's that?

1025
00:57:13,076 --> 00:57:15,601
Battery-operated pith helmet, with fan.

1026
00:57:15,957 --> 00:57:18,142
Why is this necessary in life?

1027
00:57:18,247 --> 00:57:21,703
I don't know. Look, look at this.
(It) also makes great fries.

1028
00:57:21,884 --> 00:57:26,033
Oh, uh-oh. Good. Call off
the dogs. The hunt is over.

1029
00:57:26,128 --> 00:57:28,597
Sally, this is the greatest.

1030
00:57:29,058 --> 00:57:31,409
Sally, please report to me.

1031
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,118
Look at this. This is the greatest.
You're gonna love this.

1032
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,951
This is a singing machine.

1033
00:57:36,007 --> 00:57:39,966
Look, you sing the lead,
and this has the backup and everything.

1034
00:57:39,992 --> 00:57:41,979
This is from Oklahoma.
Here's the lyrics right here.

1035
00:57:42,005 --> 00:57:44,445
- "Surrey With the Fringe on Top."
- Yes. Perfect.

1036
00:57:44,803 --> 00:57:45,787
 

1037
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:50,408
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry

1038
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,449
When I take you out in my surrey

1039
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:56,037
When I take you out in my surrey

1040
00:57:56,152 --> 00:57:58,990
With the fringe on top. Now you.

1041
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:01,882
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters

1042
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:04,671
When I drive them high-steppin'strutters

1043
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,299
Nosy pokes will peek through the shutters

1044
00:58:07,325 --> 00:58:09,595
And their eyes will pop

1045
00:58:09,665 --> 00:58:12,657
The wheels are yellow the upholstery's brown

1046
00:58:12,687 --> 00:58:14,988
The dashboard's genuine leather

1047
00:58:15,148 --> 00:58:18,069
With isinglass curtains that will roll...

1048
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:19,505
What?

1049
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,367
It's my voice, isn't it? You hate my voice.

1050
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:26,312
- I know. It's terrible. Joe hated it.
- It's Helen.

1051
00:58:26,982 --> 00:58:28,479
Helen?

1052
00:58:29,031 --> 00:58:30,965
She's coming right towards me.

1053
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:40,907
How are you, Harry?

1054
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:43,472
Fine. I'm fine.

1055
00:58:44,761 --> 00:58:47,596
This is Ira Stone. Harry Burns.

1056
00:58:53,832 --> 00:58:55,503
I'm sorry. This is Sally Albright.

1057
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:58,903
Helen Hillson and Ira.

1058
00:59:01,084 --> 00:59:03,484
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1059
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:07,491
Well...

1060
00:59:09,175 --> 00:59:10,155
see you.

1061
00:59:10,226 --> 00:59:12,086
Yeah. Bye.

1062
00:59:13,896 --> 00:59:16,387
Nice to meet you, Ira.

1063
00:59:21,465 --> 00:59:22,681
You okay?

1064
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,579
Yeah, I'm perfect.

1065
00:59:27,407 --> 00:59:29,753
She looked weird, didn't she?
She looked really weird.

1066
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:31,974
- She looked very weird.
- I've never seen her before.

1067
00:59:32,048 --> 00:59:34,516
Trust me. She looked weird.
Her legs looked heavy.

1068
00:59:34,734 --> 00:59:36,640
- Really. She must be retaining water.
- Harry!

1069
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,086
Believe me, the woman saved everything.

1070
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:44,217
You sure you're okay?

1071
00:59:44,863 --> 00:59:47,893
Oh, I'm fine. Look, it had
to happen at some point.

1072
00:59:47,919 --> 00:59:50,526
In a city of eight million people,
you're bound to run into your ex-wife.

1073
00:59:50,552 --> 00:59:52,991
So, boom, it happened. And now I'm fine.

1074
00:59:57,144 --> 01:00:00,113
I like it. It works. It says home to me.

1075
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:03,256
All right. We'll let
Harry and Sally be the judge.

1076
01:00:04,547 --> 01:00:06,024
What do you think?

1077
01:00:07,235 --> 01:00:08,957
- It's nice.
- Case closed.

1078
01:00:09,018 --> 01:00:11,419
Of course he likes it. He's a guy.

1079
01:00:11,762 --> 01:00:12,620
Sally?

1080
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,891
What's so awful about it?

1081
01:00:16,995 --> 01:00:21,294
It's so awful, there's no way to even begin
to explain what's so awful about it.

1082
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:23,684
Honey, I don't object to any of your things.

1083
01:00:23,718 --> 01:00:26,101
If we had an extra room,
you could put all your things in it,

1084
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:30,992
- including your bar stools...
- Honey, wait, wait, honey.
You don't like my bar stools?

1085
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,662
Harry, come on. Someone has to be on my side.

1086
01:00:34,733 --> 01:00:37,803
I'm on your side. I'm just
trynna help you have a good taste.

1087
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:40,054
I have good taste!

1088
01:00:40,316 --> 01:00:43,009
Everybody thinks they have
good taste and a sense of humor,

1089
01:00:43,035 --> 01:00:45,526
but they couldn't possibly all have good taste.

1090
01:00:45,552 --> 01:00:49,289
You know, it's funny.
We started out like this, Helen and I.

1091
01:00:49,344 --> 01:00:52,850
We had blank walls. We hung things.
We picked out tiles together.

1092
01:00:52,944 --> 01:00:55,936
Then you know what happens? Six years
later, you find yourself singing

1093
01:00:55,998 --> 01:00:59,207
"Surrey With a Fringe on Top" in front of Ira!

1094
01:00:59,635 --> 01:01:01,569
Do we have to talk about this right now?

1095
01:01:01,637 --> 01:01:04,663
Yes, I think right now actually is
the perfect time to talk about this

1096
01:01:04,755 --> 01:01:08,486
because I want our friends to benefit
from the wisdom of my experience.

1097
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:12,295
Right now everything is great.
Everyone is happy. Everyone is in love.

1098
01:01:12,374 --> 01:01:15,722
And that's wonderful. But you
gotta know that sooner or later,

1099
01:01:15,754 --> 01:01:18,849
you're gonna be screaming at each other
about who's gonna get this dish.

1100
01:01:18,921 --> 01:01:22,118
This eight-dollar dish will cost you
a thousand dollars in phone calls

1101
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:24,152
to the legal firm of
"That's Mine, This is Yours."

1102
01:01:24,178 --> 01:01:24,734
Harry.

1103
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,687
Please.

1104
01:01:26,423 --> 01:01:27,447
Jess, Marie.

1105
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,698
Do me a favor for your own good.

1106
01:01:29,765 --> 01:01:31,981
Put your name in your books right now,

1107
01:01:32,148 --> 01:01:34,097
before they get mixed up
and you don't know whose is whose.

1108
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:36,035
Because someday, believe it or not,

1109
01:01:36,105 --> 01:01:39,199
you'll go fifteen rounds over
who's gonna get this coffee table.

1110
01:01:39,473 --> 01:01:41,869
This stupid, wagon wheel,

1111
01:01:41,895 --> 01:01:44,811
Roy Rogers, garage sale coffee table!

1112
01:01:46,675 --> 01:01:48,178
I thought you liked it.

1113
01:01:48,355 --> 01:01:50,637
I was being nice!

1114
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:57,420
He just bumped into Helen.

1115
01:02:04,383 --> 01:02:07,292
I want you to know

1116
01:02:07,411 --> 01:02:11,545
that I will never want
that wagon wheel coffee table.

1117
01:02:20,395 --> 01:02:22,926
I know. I know. I shouldn't have done that.

1118
01:02:23,697 --> 01:02:27,570
Harry, you're gonna have to try and find
a way of not expressing every feeling

1119
01:02:27,647 --> 01:02:30,421
that you have every moment that you have them.

1120
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,141
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1121
01:02:33,306 --> 01:02:36,210
There are times and places for things.

1122
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:40,431
Well, the next time you're giving a lecture
series on social graces, Would you let me know

1123
01:02:40,503 --> 01:02:41,936
'cause I'll sign up.

1124
01:02:42,004 --> 01:02:45,701
Hey! You don't have to take
your anger out on me.

1125
01:02:45,814 --> 01:02:48,044
Oh, I think I'm entitled to throw
a little anger your way,

1126
01:02:48,077 --> 01:02:51,945
especially when I'm being told how to
live my life by Miss Hospital Corners.

1127
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:55,848
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I mean nothing bothers you.

1128
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:57,978
You never get upset about anything!

1129
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,540
Don't be ridiculous.

1130
01:02:59,755 --> 01:03:02,781
What? You never get upset about Joe.

1131
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:05,694
I never see that back up on you.
How is that possible?

1132
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,086
Don't you experience any feelings of loss?

1133
01:03:08,254 --> 01:03:10,293
I don't have to take this crap from you.

1134
01:03:10,326 --> 01:03:12,631
If you're so over Joe,
why aren't you seeing anyone?

1135
01:03:12,657 --> 01:03:14,594
- I see people!
- See people.

1136
01:03:14,703 --> 01:03:17,364
Have you slept with one person
since you broke up with Joe?

1137
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,285
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

1138
01:03:20,372 --> 01:03:24,167
That will prove I'm over Joe
because I fuck somebody?

1139
01:03:24,413 --> 01:03:26,366
You're gonna have to move back to New Jersey,

1140
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:28,206
because you slept with everybody in New York,

1141
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,481
and I don't see that turning Helen
into a faint memory for you.

1142
01:03:32,173 --> 01:03:35,291
Besides, I will make love to somebody
when it is making love,

1143
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:38,757
not the way you do it, like you're
out for revenge or something.

1144
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,344
Are you finished now?

1145
01:03:42,665 --> 01:03:43,704
Yes.

1146
01:03:44,345 --> 01:03:46,113
Can I say something?

1147
01:03:46,825 --> 01:03:48,072
Yes.

1148
01:03:51,073 --> 01:03:53,598
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1149
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,854
Don't say a word.

1150
01:04:10,993 --> 01:04:13,928
It's a monkey. Monkey see, monkey do.

1151
01:04:13,996 --> 01:04:16,780
- It's an ape. Going ape.
- It's a baby!

1152
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:19,930
- Planet of the Apes.
- She just said it's a baby.

1153
01:04:20,002 --> 01:04:22,425
- How 'bout planet of the dopes?
- It doesn't look like a baby.

1154
01:04:22,512 --> 01:04:24,997
Bigmouth baby. Mick Jagger as a baby!

1155
01:04:25,037 --> 01:04:27,773
- Baby ape! Baby ape!
- Stop with the apes, would you please?

1156
01:04:27,843 --> 01:04:31,006
- Baby's breath!
- Rosemary's Baby's mouth.

1157
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,605
- Won't you come home, Bill Baby?
- Kiss the baby.

1158
01:04:33,682 --> 01:04:38,278
- Melancholy Baby's mouth.
- Baby fish mouth! Baby fish mouth!

1159
01:04:39,021 --> 01:04:41,751
- Fifteen seconds.
- Baby Boom!

1160
01:04:41,913 --> 01:04:45,570
- Baby...
- Draw something resembling anything.

1161
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:49,724
- Baby... Ur, crying baby. Kiss the baby.
- Baby spitting up. Exorcist baby!

1162
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,830
- Yes, sir, that's my baby!
- No, sir, don't mean maybe.

1163
01:04:53,903 --> 01:04:55,359
That's it. Time's up.

1164
01:04:55,385 --> 01:04:56,623
Baby talk.

1165
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:58,286
Baby talk? What's that? That's not a saying.

1166
01:04:58,286 --> 01:05:00,311
Baby talk? What's that? That's not a saying.

1167
01:05:00,389 --> 01:05:03,654
Oh, but "baby fish mouth" is sweeping
the nation. I hear them talking.

1168
01:05:04,472 --> 01:05:09,102
Final score. Our team, 110. You guys, 60.

1169
01:05:12,168 --> 01:05:13,041
Well.

1170
01:05:13,067 --> 01:05:13,927
I can't draw.

1171
01:05:13,991 --> 01:05:17,771
No. That's a baby, and it's clearly talking.

1172
01:05:18,088 --> 01:05:19,773
You're wonderful.

1173
01:05:20,184 --> 01:05:21,775
All right, who wants coffee?

1174
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,715
- I do, and I love you.
- Do you have any tea?

1175
01:05:23,874 --> 01:05:25,713
- One tea.
- Industrial strength.

1176
01:05:26,057 --> 01:05:29,445
- I'll help you. Decaf?
- Yeah.

1177
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:31,606
- Three.
- Yes, please.

1178
01:05:31,705 --> 01:05:32,258
Cream?

1179
01:05:32,284 --> 01:05:34,980
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through that door, down the hall.

1180
01:05:42,489 --> 01:05:44,232
Never looked like a baby to me.

1181
01:05:44,299 --> 01:05:45,847
- Which part?
- All of it.

1182
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:47,817
Hey, Jess. You were gonna
show me the cover off your book.

1183
01:05:47,874 --> 01:05:49,411
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's in the den.

1184
01:05:49,437 --> 01:05:53,535
Look, Good. Julian, help yourself.
Have more wine, whatever you like, okay?

1185
01:05:53,975 --> 01:05:56,405
I like saying, "It's in the den."
It's got a nice ring to it.

1186
01:05:56,678 --> 01:05:59,617
Emily is a little young
for Harry, don't you think?

1187
01:05:59,847 --> 01:06:02,446
Well, she's young, but look what she's done.

1188
01:06:02,617 --> 01:06:05,109
What has she done? She makes desserts.

1189
01:06:05,186 --> 01:06:07,120
Does Julian seem a little stuffy to you?

1190
01:06:07,188 --> 01:06:09,656
He's a good guy. You should
talk to him, get to know him.

1191
01:06:09,724 --> 01:06:11,123
He's too tall to talk to.

1192
01:06:11,192 --> 01:06:14,389
She makes thirty-five hundred
chocolate mousse pies a week.

1193
01:06:15,854 --> 01:06:17,871
Emily is "Aunt Emily"?

1194
01:06:18,022 --> 01:06:20,591
He took us all to a Met game
last week. It was great.

1195
01:06:20,669 --> 01:06:25,197
- You all went to a Met game together?
- Yeah, but, it was a last-minute thing.

1196
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:26,740
But Sally hates baseball.

1197
01:06:26,808 --> 01:06:31,441
- Harry doesn't even like sweets.
- Julian is great.

1198
01:06:31,926 --> 01:06:33,905
I know. He's a grown-up.

1199
01:06:33,982 --> 01:06:36,109
- Emily is terrific.
- Yeah.

1200
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,618
Of course when I asked her
where she was when Kennedy was shot,

1201
01:06:38,687 --> 01:06:40,467
she said, "Ted Kennedy was shot?"

1202
01:06:53,268 --> 01:06:55,327
- Hello.
- Are you alone?

1203
01:06:55,437 --> 01:06:58,998
- Yeah, I was just finishing a book.
- Could you come over?

1204
01:06:59,345 --> 01:07:02,305
- What's the matter?
- He's getting married.

1205
01:07:02,637 --> 01:07:03,552
Who?

1206
01:07:04,202 --> 01:07:05,803
Joe.

1207
01:07:06,378 --> 01:07:08,312
I'll be right there.

1208
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:13,160
Hi.

1209
01:07:13,902 --> 01:07:15,767
Are you all right?

1210
01:07:17,692 --> 01:07:19,626
Come on in.

1211
01:07:22,568 --> 01:07:25,503
- I'm sorry to call you so late.
- It's all right.

1212
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:29,386
- I need a Kleenex.
- Okay.

1213
01:07:31,578 --> 01:07:34,272
He just called me up,
"wanted to see how you were."

1214
01:07:34,399 --> 01:07:36,876
"Fine. How are you?" "Fine."

1215
01:07:36,945 --> 01:07:40,745
His secretary is on vacation,
everything's all backed up,

1216
01:07:40,815 --> 01:07:44,986
he's got a big case in Newark, blah, blah, blah.

1217
01:07:45,677 --> 01:07:47,901
And I'm sitting on the phone thinking

1218
01:07:47,927 --> 01:07:50,099
"I'm over him. I really am over him.

1219
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:53,720
I can't believe I was ever remotely
interested in any of this."

1220
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:58,597
And then he said, "I have some news."

1221
01:08:02,371 --> 01:08:06,603
She works in his office.
She's a paralegal. Her name is Kimberly.

1222
01:08:08,495 --> 01:08:10,429
He just met her.

1223
01:08:10,698 --> 01:08:13,480
She's supposed to be his transitional person.

1224
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:16,210
She's not supposed to be the one.

1225
01:08:21,656 --> 01:08:26,423
All this time, I've been saying
that he didn't wanna get married.

1226
01:08:27,972 --> 01:08:32,798
But the truth is, he didn't wanna marry me.

1227
01:08:36,127 --> 01:08:38,061
He didn't love me.

1228
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,901
If you could take him back
right now, would you?

1229
01:08:46,781 --> 01:08:48,440
No!

1230
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:52,011
But why didn't he wanna marry me?

1231
01:08:52,554 --> 01:08:55,261
- What's the matter with me?
- Nothing.

1232
01:08:55,657 --> 01:08:57,734
- I'm difficult.
- You're challenging.

1233
01:08:57,869 --> 01:09:00,818
I'm too structured.
I'm completely closed off.

1234
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,312
But in a good way.

1235
01:09:02,793 --> 01:09:06,229
No. No, I drove him away.

1236
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:10,643
And I'm gonna be 40.

1237
01:09:11,706 --> 01:09:12,799
When?

1238
01:09:13,341 --> 01:09:15,841
- Someday.
- In eight years.

1239
01:09:16,197 --> 01:09:17,751
But it's there.

1240
01:09:17,812 --> 01:09:21,779
It's just sitting there
like this big dead end.

1241
01:09:22,401 --> 01:09:24,613
And it's not the same for men.

1242
01:09:24,871 --> 01:09:28,071
Charlie Chaplin had babies
when he was seventy-three.

1243
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:30,397
Yeah, but he was too old to pick 'em up.

1244
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,662
Oh, come here. Come here.

1245
01:09:38,733 --> 01:09:40,701
It's gonna be okay.

1246
01:09:40,879 --> 01:09:42,926
It's gonna be fine. You'll see.

1247
01:09:44,439 --> 01:09:46,771
Oh, go ahead. It's not one
of my favorites anyway.

1248
01:09:49,444 --> 01:09:52,067
It's gonna be okay. Hmm?

1249
01:09:57,953 --> 01:09:59,517
 

1250
01:09:59,913 --> 01:10:00,876
You're okay.

1251
01:10:01,569 --> 01:10:02,617
 

1252
01:10:04,926 --> 01:10:05,862
I'll make some tea.

1253
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:08,978
Harry. Could you just
hold me a little longer?

1254
01:10:09,019 --> 01:10:10,798
Oh, sure.

1255
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,024
 

1256
01:10:51,072 --> 01:10:52,758
Are you comfortable?

1257
01:10:53,109 --> 01:10:54,257
Sure.

1258
01:10:59,914 --> 01:11:02,144
Do you want something to drink or something?

1259
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,884
No, I'm okay.

1260
01:11:05,108 --> 01:11:08,778
Well, I'm gonna get up for some water,
so it's really no trouble.

1261
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:11,067
Okay, water.

1262
01:12:06,538 --> 01:12:10,039
You have all your videotapes
alphabetized and on index cards?

1263
01:12:11,419 --> 01:12:14,513
- Thank you.
- Do you wanna watch something?

1264
01:12:14,898 --> 01:12:19,301
- No, not unless you do.
- No. That's okay.

1265
01:12:33,363 --> 01:12:35,506
Do you wanna go to sleep?

1266
01:12:35,783 --> 01:12:37,216
Okay.

1267
01:13:11,127 --> 01:13:12,901
Where are you going?

1268
01:13:13,796 --> 01:13:15,542
I gotta go.

1269
01:13:17,294 --> 01:13:20,588
Gotta go home, I gotta change my clothes,
then I have to go to work. And so do you.

1270
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:22,907
But after work I'd like to take you
out to dinner if you're free.

1271
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:25,534
- Are you free?
- Yes.

1272
01:13:25,744 --> 01:13:27,075
Fine. I'll call you later.

1273
01:13:27,746 --> 01:13:30,673
- Fine.
- Fine.

1274
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:50,227
Yours.

1275
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,861
- Hello.
- I'm sorry to call so early.

1276
01:13:52,984 --> 01:13:55,077
- Are you all right?
- No one I know would call at this hour.

1277
01:13:55,137 --> 01:13:57,367
- I did something terrible.
- What did you do?

1278
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,408
- No one I know would call at this hour.
- It's so awful.

1279
01:13:59,475 --> 01:14:00,796
- I need to talk.
- What happened?

1280
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,443
- What's the matter?
- Harry came over last night.

1281
01:14:02,495 --> 01:14:05,348
- I went to Sally's last night.
- Because I was upset Joe was getting married.

1282
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,540
- And one thing led to another.
- Before I knew it we were kissing.

1283
01:14:07,604 --> 01:14:09,785
- To make a long story short, we did it.
- We did it.

1284
01:14:10,034 --> 01:14:12,412
- They did it.
- That's great, Sally.

1285
01:14:12,488 --> 01:14:14,840
- We've been praying for you.
- You should've done it in the first place.

1286
01:14:14,912 --> 01:14:17,287
- For months, we've been saying you should do it.
- You guys belong together.

1287
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:20,785
- It's like killing two birds with one stone.
- It's like two wrongs make a right.

1288
01:14:20,934 --> 01:14:22,524
- How was it?
- The during part was good.

1289
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:24,190
- I thought it was good.
- But then I felt suffocated.

1290
01:14:24,216 --> 01:14:26,645
- But then I guess it wasn't.
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- The worst.

1291
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:28,226
- I had to get out of there.
- He just disappeared.

1292
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:30,110
- I feel so bad.
- I'm so embarrassed.

1293
01:14:30,136 --> 01:14:31,438
- I don't blame you.
- That's horrible.

1294
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:33,537
- I think I'm coming down with something.
- I'm catching a cold.

1295
01:14:33,611 --> 01:14:35,771
Look, it would've been great if
it worked out, but it didn't.

1296
01:14:35,797 --> 01:14:37,178
You should never go to bed with anyone

1297
01:14:37,246 --> 01:14:39,162
when you've found out your
last boyfriend is getting married.

1298
01:14:39,226 --> 01:14:40,392
- Who's that talking?
- Who?

1299
01:14:40,447 --> 01:14:42,544
- Is that Jess on the phone?
- It's Jane Fonda on the VCR.

1300
01:14:42,618 --> 01:14:45,280
- It's Bryant Gumbel.
- You wanna come over for breakfast?

1301
01:14:45,383 --> 01:14:47,788
- No, I'm not up to it.
- No, I feel too awful.

1302
01:14:47,857 --> 01:14:51,088
- Good. I mean it's so early.
- But call me later if you want.

1303
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,128
- I'll call you later, okay?
- Okay, bye.

1304
01:14:53,173 --> 01:14:54,924
- Bye.
- Bye.

1305
01:14:57,042 --> 01:14:59,738
- God!
- I know.

1306
01:15:00,836 --> 01:15:03,999
Tell me I'll never have to be out there again.

1307
01:15:07,239 --> 01:15:09,673
You will never have to be out there again.

1308
01:15:13,429 --> 01:15:15,829
I'll just say we made a mistake.

1309
01:15:16,599 --> 01:15:20,000
Sally, it was a mistake.

1310
01:15:21,738 --> 01:15:24,332
I just hope I get to say it first.

1311
01:15:25,127 --> 01:15:27,789
I hope she says it before I do.

1312
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:32,023
It was a mistake.

1313
01:15:32,101 --> 01:15:34,535
I am so relieved that you think so too.

1314
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:38,397
I'm not saying last night wasn't great.

1315
01:15:39,163 --> 01:15:42,223
- It was.
- Yes, it was.

1316
01:15:43,274 --> 01:15:46,704
- We just never should have done it.
- I couldn't agree more.

1317
01:15:47,122 --> 01:15:50,460
- I'm so relieved.
- Great.

1318
01:15:50,524 --> 01:15:51,400
Yeah.

1319
01:15:54,793 --> 01:15:56,727
Two mixed green salads.

1320
01:16:26,396 --> 01:16:31,231
It is so nice when you can sit with
someone and not have to talk. Hmm?

1321
01:16:35,238 --> 01:16:37,876
It's just like, most of the time
you go to bed with someone,

1322
01:16:37,951 --> 01:16:41,909
then she tells you all her stories,
you tell her your stories.

1323
01:16:42,099 --> 01:16:45,798
With Sally and me, we'd already
heard each other's stories.

1324
01:16:46,058 --> 01:16:49,833
So once we went to bed, we didn't know
what we were supposed to do. You know?

1325
01:16:49,912 --> 01:16:52,158
Sure, Harry.

1326
01:16:53,073 --> 01:16:54,540
I don't know.

1327
01:16:54,798 --> 01:16:56,565
Maybe you get to a certain
point in a relationship

1328
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:58,719
where it's just too late to have sex.

1329
01:16:58,787 --> 01:17:00,003
You know?

1330
01:17:10,232 --> 01:17:12,409
Is Harry bringing anyone to the wedding?

1331
01:17:12,735 --> 01:17:14,600
I don't think so.

1332
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,605
Is he seeing anyone?

1333
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:21,700
He was seeing this anthropologist, but...

1334
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:26,734
- What did she look like?
- Thin. Pretty. Big tits.

1335
01:17:26,928 --> 01:17:28,418
Your basic nightmare.

1336
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:34,599
What do you think?

1337
01:17:36,455 --> 01:17:38,787
Oh, Marie.

1338
01:17:39,397 --> 01:17:41,262
You tell the truth.

1339
01:17:42,682 --> 01:17:44,775
It's just beautiful.

1340
01:18:16,765 --> 01:18:18,474
We are gathered here today

1341
01:18:18,515 --> 01:18:22,758
to celebrate the marriage of Marie and Jess

1342
01:18:23,335 --> 01:18:26,358
and to consecrate their vows of matrimony.

1343
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:30,085
The vows they will take join their lives.

1344
01:18:30,312 --> 01:18:35,202
The wine they will share
binds all their hopes together.

1345
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:39,792
And by the rings they will wear,
they will be known to all

1346
01:18:39,888 --> 01:18:42,845
as husband and wife.

1347
01:18:53,268 --> 01:18:57,204
I've never seen her so happy.
She's a totally different person.

1348
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,978
Oh, yeah, she is, girl. It's great,
but what are we gonna do about you?

1349
01:19:02,044 --> 01:19:04,376
- Me?
- Honey, you wanna dance?

1350
01:19:04,446 --> 01:19:06,151
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do.

1351
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:07,714
Excuse us.

1352
01:19:10,465 --> 01:19:11,323
Hi.

1353
01:19:11,517 --> 01:19:12,581
Hello.

1354
01:19:16,795 --> 01:19:19,491
- Nice ceremony.
- Beautiful.

1355
01:19:22,494 --> 01:19:24,721
Boy, the holidays are rough.
Every year I just try to

1356
01:19:24,747 --> 01:19:27,709
get from the day before Thanksgiving
to the day after New Year's.

1357
01:19:27,774 --> 01:19:29,742
A lot of suicides.

1358
01:19:31,373 --> 01:19:33,231
Would you like a pea pod with a shrimp?

1359
01:19:33,278 --> 01:19:34,638
Thank you.

1360
01:19:35,741 --> 01:19:37,673
- How've you been?
- Fine.

1361
01:19:38,778 --> 01:19:39,860
Are you seeing anybody?

1362
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:41,085
- Harry.
- What?

1363
01:19:41,111 --> 01:19:42,989
- I don't want to talk about this.
- Why not?

1364
01:19:43,035 --> 01:19:45,955
I don't want to talk about it.

1365
01:19:46,244 --> 01:19:48,092
Why can't we get past this?

1366
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:50,566
I mean, are we gonna carry
this thing around forever?

1367
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:54,765
- Forever? It just happened.
- It happened three weeks ago.

1368
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:58,157
You know how a year to a person
is like seven years to a dog?

1369
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:01,096
Yes.

1370
01:20:03,303 --> 01:20:06,415
Is one of us supposed
to be a dog in this scenario?

1371
01:20:06,603 --> 01:20:09,137
- Yes.
- Who is the dog?

1372
01:20:09,254 --> 01:20:11,179
- You are.
- I am?

1373
01:20:11,538 --> 01:20:12,399
- I am the dog?
- Mm hmm.

1374
01:20:12,463 --> 01:20:14,582
I am the dog? I...

1375
01:20:21,096 --> 01:20:24,072
I don't see that, Harry.
If anybody is the dog, you are the dog.

1376
01:20:24,104 --> 01:20:26,184
You wanna act like what happened
didn't mean anything.

1377
01:20:26,234 --> 01:20:27,653
I'm not saying it didn't mean anything.

1378
01:20:27,694 --> 01:20:29,519
I'm saying, why does it
have to mean everything?

1379
01:20:29,568 --> 01:20:32,738
Because it does. And you should
know that better than anybody,

1380
01:20:32,772 --> 01:20:35,070
because the minute that it happened,
you walked right out the door.

1381
01:20:35,135 --> 01:20:37,956
- I didn't walk out.
- No. Sprinted is more like it.

1382
01:20:38,145 --> 01:20:41,702
- We both agreed it was a mistake.
- The worst mistake I ever made.

1383
01:20:43,474 --> 01:20:45,722
- What do you want from me?
- I don't want anything from you!

1384
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:47,748
Fine! Fine. But let's get one thing straight.

1385
01:20:47,802 --> 01:20:49,859
I did not go over there
that night to make love to you.

1386
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:51,475
That is not why I went there.

1387
01:20:51,557 --> 01:20:54,560
But you looked up at me with these big,
weepy eyes. "Don't go home tonight, Harry.

1388
01:20:54,608 --> 01:20:57,157
Hold me a little longer, Harry."
What was I supposed to do?

1389
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:59,772
What are you saying? You took pity on me?

1390
01:20:59,828 --> 01:21:01,929
- No, I was...
- Fuck you!

1391
01:21:05,837 --> 01:21:08,959
Hey, everybody, could I have
your attention, please?

1392
01:21:09,079 --> 01:21:13,322
I'd like to propose
a toast to Harry and Sally.

1393
01:21:13,609 --> 01:21:15,324
To Harry and Sally.

1394
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:19,972
If Marie or I had found either
of them remotely attractive,

1395
01:21:20,045 --> 01:21:21,979
we would not be here today.

1396
01:21:32,129 --> 01:21:37,132
 

1397
01:21:37,936 --> 01:21:40,668
 

1398
01:21:42,262 --> 01:21:48,101
 

1399
01:21:52,588 --> 01:21:56,905
 

1400
01:21:57,868 --> 01:22:01,082
 

1401
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:08,446
 

1402
01:22:09,917 --> 01:22:11,220
Hi. It's me.

1403
01:22:11,394 --> 01:22:13,657
It's the holiday season
and I thought I'd remind you

1404
01:22:13,697 --> 01:22:16,116
that this is the season
of charity and forgiveness.

1405
01:22:16,273 --> 01:22:18,423
And, although it is not widely known,

1406
01:22:18,493 --> 01:22:20,791
it is also the season of groveling.

1407
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,682
So if you felt like calling me back,

1408
01:22:23,744 --> 01:22:27,778
I'd be more than happy to do
the traditional Christmas grovel.

1409
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:29,095
Give me a call.

1410
01:22:45,838 --> 01:22:48,695
Hi. I'm not home right now.
I'll call you right back.

1411
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:51,825
If you're there, pick up the phone.
I really wanna talk to you.

1412
01:22:55,523 --> 01:22:58,315
The fact that you're not answering
leads me to believe you're either,

1413
01:22:58,378 --> 01:23:00,133
A, not at home,

1414
01:23:00,201 --> 01:23:02,721
B, home but don't wanna talk to me,

1415
01:23:02,808 --> 01:23:07,891
or C, home, desperately wanna talk to me,
but trapped under something heavy.

1416
01:23:08,405 --> 01:23:11,135
If it's either A or C, please call me back.

1417
01:23:13,805 --> 01:23:15,531
Obviously, she doesn't wanna talk to me.

1418
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:17,857
What do I have to do, be hit over the head?

1419
01:23:17,943 --> 01:23:19,649
She wants to call me, she'll call me.

1420
01:23:20,071 --> 01:23:21,882
I am through making a schmuck out of myself.

1421
01:23:22,351 --> 01:23:25,749
If you're feeling sad and lonely

1422
01:23:25,861 --> 01:23:29,010
There's a service I can render

1423
01:23:29,117 --> 01:23:32,122
Tell the one who digs you only

1424
01:23:32,218 --> 01:23:35,599
I can be so warm and tender

1425
01:23:35,745 --> 01:23:37,029
Call me

1426
01:23:37,298 --> 01:23:40,842
Maybe it's late to just call me

1427
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:44,621
Don't be afraid to just phone moi.

1428
01:23:44,717 --> 01:23:48,541
Call me and I'll be around

1429
01:23:48,887 --> 01:23:51,141
- Give me a call.
- Hi, Harry.

1430
01:23:51,302 --> 01:23:55,622
Hello. Hi. I didn't know that you were there.

1431
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:58,557
- What are you doing?
- I was just on my way out.

1432
01:23:58,878 --> 01:24:00,494
Where are you going?

1433
01:24:01,496 --> 01:24:04,158
- What do you want, Harry?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1434
01:24:04,232 --> 01:24:07,599
I just called to say I'm sorry.

1435
01:24:09,332 --> 01:24:10,765
Okay.

1436
01:24:18,227 --> 01:24:19,403
I gotta go.

1437
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,555
Wait a second. Wait a second.

1438
01:24:22,016 --> 01:24:23,208
What are you doing for New Year's?

1439
01:24:23,419 --> 01:24:24,773
Are you going to the Tylers' party?

1440
01:24:24,799 --> 01:24:27,313
'Cause I don't have a date.
And if you don't have a date,

1441
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:29,673
we always said that if
neither one of us had a date,

1442
01:24:29,727 --> 01:24:32,565
we could be together for New Year's and...

1443
01:24:32,676 --> 01:24:36,271
I can't do this anymore.
I am not your consolation prize.

1444
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:37,449
Goodbye.

1445
01:24:47,345 --> 01:24:49,475
And here we are, once again,

1446
01:24:49,544 --> 01:24:52,666
the 16th annual New Year's Rockin' Eve,

1447
01:24:52,753 --> 01:24:54,776
coming to you live from the ...

1448
01:24:54,946 --> 01:24:56,375
What's so bad about this?

1449
01:24:56,451 --> 01:24:58,442
You got Dick Clark. That's tradition.

1450
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:01,207
You got Malomars.
The greatest cookie of all time.

1451
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:05,888
And you're about to give the Knicks
their first championship since 1973.

1452
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:26,436
I don't know why I let you drag me to this.

1453
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:35,180
This is much better. Fresh air.
I've the streets all to myself.

1454
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:39,124
Who needs to be at a big crowded party
pretending to have a good time?

1455
01:25:39,372 --> 01:25:42,993
Plus this is the perfect time
to catch up on my window shopping.

1456
01:25:43,397 --> 01:25:45,331
This is good.

1457
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:59,595
So the guy says, "Read the card."

1458
01:26:09,743 --> 01:26:12,371
- I'm going home.
- You'll never get a taxi.

1459
01:26:14,008 --> 01:26:15,066
Oh, God!

1460
01:26:42,857 --> 01:26:45,249
You realize, of course,
that we could never be friends.

1461
01:26:45,526 --> 01:26:46,757
Why not?

1462
01:26:46,842 --> 01:26:49,551
What I'm saying, is that
men and women can't be friends,

1463
01:26:49,599 --> 01:26:51,706
because the sex part always gets in the way.

1464
01:26:52,048 --> 01:26:53,266
That's not true.

1465
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:55,768
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

1466
01:26:55,946 --> 01:26:57,771
He always wants to have sex with her.

1467
01:26:58,122 --> 01:27:00,155
What if they don't wanna have sex with you?

1468
01:27:00,219 --> 01:27:02,508
Doesn't matter, because
the sex thing is already out there,

1469
01:27:02,561 --> 01:27:06,256
so the friendship is ultimately doomed,
and that is the end of the story.

1470
01:27:06,704 --> 01:27:08,830
Well, I guess we're not gonna be friends then.

1471
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:09,773
Guess not.

1472
01:27:09,806 --> 01:27:11,452
It's too bad,

1473
01:27:11,478 --> 01:27:14,708
'cause you were the only person
that I knew in New York.

1474
01:27:18,437 --> 01:27:23,105
 

1475
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:31,149
 

1476
01:27:34,779 --> 01:27:37,612
 

1477
01:27:37,828 --> 01:27:41,505
 

1478
01:27:41,996 --> 01:27:45,020
 

1479
01:27:49,092 --> 01:27:54,332
 

1480
01:27:55,348 --> 01:28:00,695
 

1481
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:02,718
I'm going.

1482
01:28:03,003 --> 01:28:04,320
It's almost midnight.

1483
01:28:04,888 --> 01:28:08,949
- Well, the thought of not
kissing somebody is just...
- I'll kiss you.

1484
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:11,703
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

1485
01:28:17,057 --> 01:28:19,199
Come on. Stay. Please.

1486
01:28:19,463 --> 01:28:21,502
Thanks, Jess. I'll just... I have to go.

1487
01:28:21,614 --> 01:28:24,282
- Oh, wait two minutes.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

1488
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:28,649
 

1489
01:28:32,031 --> 01:28:35,469
 

1490
01:28:35,868 --> 01:28:39,059
 

1491
01:28:39,915 --> 01:28:44,635
 

1492
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:50,075
 

1493
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:53,942
 

1494
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:58,132
 

1495
01:28:58,204 --> 01:29:01,243
 

1496
01:29:01,435 --> 01:29:04,147
 

1497
01:29:04,227 --> 01:29:07,777
I've been doing a lot of thinking,
and the thing is, I love you.

1498
01:29:08,432 --> 01:29:10,611
- What?
- I love you.

1499
01:29:11,613 --> 01:29:13,946
How do you expect me to respond to this?

1500
01:29:14,157 --> 01:29:16,118
How about you love me too?

1501
01:29:16,412 --> 01:29:17,992
How about "I'm leaving"?

1502
01:29:18,081 --> 01:29:20,289
Doesn't what I said mean anything to you?

1503
01:29:20,446 --> 01:29:23,274
I'm sorry, Harry. I know it's New Year's Eve.

1504
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:26,535
I know you're feeling lonely,
but you just can't show up here,

1505
01:29:26,623 --> 01:29:29,607
tell me you love me and expect that
to make everything all right.

1506
01:29:29,751 --> 01:29:31,713
- Three, two, one!
- It doesn't work this way.

1507
01:29:31,842 --> 01:29:33,269
Well, how does it work?

1508
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,853
I don't know, but not this way.

1509
01:29:36,147 --> 01:29:37,551
How about this way?

1510
01:29:37,662 --> 01:29:40,290
I love that you get cold
when it's 71 degrees out.

1511
01:29:40,437 --> 01:29:43,065
I love that it takes you an hour
and a half to order a sandwich.

1512
01:29:43,202 --> 01:29:45,116
I love that you get a little
crinkle above your nose

1513
01:29:45,184 --> 01:29:46,638
when you're looking at me like I'm nuts.

1514
01:29:46,704 --> 01:29:50,538
I love after I spend the day with you,
I can still smell your perfume on my clothes.

1515
01:29:50,641 --> 01:29:55,343
And I love that you are the last person
I wanna talk to before I go to sleep at night.

1516
01:29:55,485 --> 01:29:59,263
And it's not because I'm lonely, and
it's not because it's New Year's Eve.

1517
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:01,387
I came here tonight, because when you realize

1518
01:30:01,421 --> 01:30:03,648
you wanna spend the rest of
your life with somebody,

1519
01:30:03,712 --> 01:30:07,260
you want the rest of your life
to start as soon as possible.

1520
01:30:10,733 --> 01:30:12,166
You see?

1521
01:30:13,231 --> 01:30:15,387
That is just like you, Harry.

1522
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:20,081
You say things like that and you make
it impossible for me to hate you.

1523
01:30:20,941 --> 01:30:23,774
And I hate you, Harry.

1524
01:30:24,881 --> 01:30:27,315
I really hate you.

1525
01:30:30,968 --> 01:30:32,629
I hate you.

1526
01:30:39,529 --> 01:30:46,346
We'll take a cup of kindness yet

1527
01:30:46,522 --> 01:30:50,253
For auld lang syne

1528
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:53,623
What does this song mean? My whole life
I don't know what this song means.

1529
01:30:53,669 --> 01:30:55,771
I mean, "Should old acquaintance be forgot."

1530
01:30:55,827 --> 01:30:57,602
Does that mean that we
should forget old acquaintances,

1531
01:30:57,657 --> 01:30:59,952
or does it mean if we happen to
forget them, we should remember them,

1532
01:30:59,991 --> 01:31:02,301
which is not possible
because we already forgot 'em.

1533
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:07,288
Well, maybe it just means that we should
remember that we forgot them, or something.

1534
01:31:09,878 --> 01:31:12,847
Anyway, it's about old friends.

1535
01:31:15,046 --> 01:31:19,740
In days of auld lang syne

1536
01:31:19,815 --> 01:31:22,004
The first time we met, we hated each other.

1537
01:31:22,253 --> 01:31:24,729
No, you didn't hate me. I hated you.

1538
01:31:24,974 --> 01:31:27,274
The second time we met,
you didn't even remember me.

1539
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:29,534
I did too. I remembered you.

1540
01:31:29,779 --> 01:31:32,296
The third time we met, we became friends.

1541
01:31:32,376 --> 01:31:35,856
- We were friends for a long time.
- And then we weren't.

1542
01:31:36,037 --> 01:31:38,192
And then we fell in love.

1543
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:41,879
- Three months later, we got married.
- And it only took three months.

1544
01:31:42,526 --> 01:31:46,428
- Twelve years and three months.
- We had this really wonderful wedding.

1545
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,984
- It really was a beautiful wedding.
- It was great.

1546
01:31:49,097 --> 01:31:50,972
We had this enormous coconut cake.

1547
01:31:51,218 --> 01:31:53,532
A huge coconut cake with the tiers

1548
01:31:53,603 --> 01:31:56,671
and there was this very rich
chocolate sauce on the side.

1549
01:31:56,718 --> 01:32:00,340
Right. 'Cause not everybody likes it on
the cake 'cause it makes it very soggy.

1550
01:32:00,426 --> 01:32:03,062
Particularly the coconut,
soaks up a lot of that sauce, you really...

1551
01:32:03,113 --> 01:32:05,282
- it's important to keep it on the side.
- Right.
