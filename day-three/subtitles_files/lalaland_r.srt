And I'll admit
I was a little curt that night.

00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,691
Curt?

364
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,651
Okay, I was an asshole.
I can admit that.

00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,735
Okay.

366
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:42,030
But requesting "I Ran" from a serious
musician, it's just... It's too far.

367
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,742
My Lord! Did you just say
"a serious musician"?

368
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,995
- I don't think so.
- Can I borrow what you're wearing?

369
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,830
- Why?
- 'Cause I have an audition next week.

371
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,001

I thought you looked familiar.

That's a classic.

- Oh, I see. You're a barista.
- Yeah.

375
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,053

look down on me from all the way up there.

00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:16,315

- [Carlo] You heard of Joseph Campbell?
- [Mia] Uh, yeah.

I have this idea to do a re-imagining
of <i>Goldilocks and The Three Bears</i>,

384
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,078
but from the perspective
of the bears.

385
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,039
- The hero's journey.
- It could be like a franchise.

386
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,123
- Right.
- So we don't know.

387
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,875
There could have been a fourth bear,
we don't know.

Mmm-hmm, yes.

- Can you grab mine?
- Can I what?

00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,561
Would you be able
to grab mine? My keys?

395

- I can't hear.
- Sorry.

- Oh.

- It's a Prius.

- They are.

Thank you for saving the day
back there.

Well, you didn't really
give me much of a choice.

405
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,808
It's pretty strange that we keep running
into each other.

406
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,812
It is strange.
Maybe it means something.

407
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,146
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

- Ooh.
- I think it gives you cancer,

413
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,075
- but you find your car faster.
- What?

414
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,911
You don't live as long, but you get where
you're going quicker, so it all evens out.

- Okay.

00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,230
Anyway, I love
being around this stuff, you know?

509
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,315
I know what you mean.

510
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,651
I get coffee five miles out of the way
just so I can be near a jazz club.

511
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,194
- Really?
- Yeah, the Van Beek.

512
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,362
- Do you know it?
- Mmm-mmm.

513
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:10,867
All the big swing bands used to play
there. Count Basie, Chick Webb.

514
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,369
Anyway, it's a samba-tapas
place now, so...

515
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,205
What's a samba-tapas place?

516
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,750
It's just a samba place
where they serve tapas.

517
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,793
- Oh.
- Yeah, so the joke's on...

518
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,128
- history?
- [laughs]

519
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,463
I don't know. That's L.A.

520
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,258
They just worship everything
and they value nothing.

521
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,719
[man] We're about to roll.
Stop, please, guys.

522
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,929
[whispering] Okay.

523
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,555
- You're rolling?
- Yeah.

524
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,016
I know. They shoot movies on my street
all the time, so I know about movies.

525
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,267
- Come this way.
- [man] Great.

526
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,686
- [Sebastian] It's a lock-down.
- [Mia gasps]

527
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,730
- I love her!
- [man] And here we go.

528
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,732
[whispering] Hey! How'd you get
into all this?

529
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,233
[man] And roll!

530
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,735
- Get into what?
- [man] Sound speed!

531
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,320
You know, movies, acting...

532
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,405
- [man] Action!
- Oh, um...

533
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,325
- My aunt was an actress.
- Oh, okay.

534
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,744
She was in a travelling
theatre company.

535
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,038
I grew up in Boulder City, Nevada.

536
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,707
So across the street from my house
there was this little library

537
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,417
that had an old movie section.

538
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:05,922
So she took me and we spent an entire day
watching all these old movies

539
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:10,051
like <i>Notorious</i> and <i>Bringing Up Baby</i>
and <i>Casablanca</i>.

540
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,552
- And...
- [man] Cut it there! Cut!

541
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,680
- [crew member] Check the gate.
- So we can talk now.

542
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,598
- She sounds incredible.
- She was incredible.

543
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,267
And I would put on all these plays
in my bedroom,

544
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:23,606
and it would basically just be she and I
re-enacting those scenes from the movies.

545
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,066
And then I would
write my own plays.

546
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,734
- Wow.
- Um... Yeah.

547
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,251
[indistinct chatter]

548
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,465
I love it.

549
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,681
So anyway, I left college
after two years to come here

550
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,600
and my last audition was
for a teen show

551
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,853
pitched as <i>"Dangerous Minds</i>
meets <i>The O.C."</i>

552
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,982
So, yeah, should've
been a lawyer.

553
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,984
[Sebastian] 'Cause the world
needs more lawyers.

554
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,194
[Mia, laughing] It doesn't
need more actresses.

555
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,696
You're not
just an actress.

556
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,365
- What do you mean, "just an actress"?
- You said it yourself.

557
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,868
[stammers] You're a child prodigy
playwright.

558
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,411
That is not what I said.

559
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,998
Well, you're too modest
to say it, but it's true.

560
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,833
You could just write
your own roles, you know?

561
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,793
Write something that's
as interesting as you are,

562
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,336
and you don't have to audition
for this...

563
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,755
- uh, piece of caca.
- Yeah.

564
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,256
Look at Louis Armstrong.

565
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,009
He could've just played the marching band
charts that he was given.

566
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,802
But he didn't do that.
What did he do?

567
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:38,222
- What did he do?
- He made history, didn't he?

568
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:41,267
Well, I'm gonna stop auditioning
and I'm gonna make history instead.

569
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:46,022
Well, my work is done here.

570
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,275
I should probably tell you something now,
just to get it out of the way.

571
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,610
- Mmm-hmm?
- I hate jazz.

572
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,572
Are you okay?

573
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,908
What do you mean,
you hate jazz?

574
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,743
It just means that when I listen to it,
I don't like it.

575
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,746
Yeah, but it's such a blanket statement
you don't like jazz.

576
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,081
What are you doing right now?

577
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,833
Nothing.

578
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,505
[jazz music playing]

579
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,478
I just think that people,
when they say that they...

580
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:30,024
you know, hate jazz, they just...

581
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,945
They don't have context, they don't know
where it comes from.

582
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,698
Jazz was born in a little
flophouse in New Orleans,

583
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,700
and it's just because people
were crammed in there,

584
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,370
they spoke five different languages,
they couldn't talk to each other.

585
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:46,249
The only way they could communicate
was with jazz.

586
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,708
Yeah, but what about Kenny G?

587
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,045
- What?
- What about Kenny G?

588
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,964
I mean, what about elevator music?

589
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,508
You know,
jazz music that I know?

590
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,343
- What about it?
- From my life?

591
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,762
- Mmm-hmm?
- I just find it relaxing.

592
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,223
It's not relaxing.
It's not, it's not.

593
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,434
Sidney Bechet shot somebody because
they told him he played a wrong note.

594
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:06,769
That's hardly relaxing.

595
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:11,023
Yeah, but where I grew up there was
this station called K-jazz 103.

596
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,943
And people would just put on that station
when they had a cocktail party...

597
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,278
Right.

598
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,530
And everyone would
kinda just talk over it.

599
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,614
I know.

600
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,116
- 'Cause it was...
- That's the prob--

601
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,577
Okay, okay. So I think
that's part of the problem,

602
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,453
is that you can't hear it, you know?
You have to see it.

603
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,789
You have to see what's at stake.
I mean, look at these fellas.

604
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,167
Look at the sax player
right now.

605
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,460
He just hijacked the song.
He's on his own trip.

606
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,171
Every one of these guys
is composing,

607
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,964
they're rearranging,
they're writing.

608
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,549
Then they're playing the melody.
They're just--

609
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,009
And now look,
the trumpet player.

610
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,552
He's got his own idea.

611
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:44,140
And so, it's conflict,
and it's compromise, and it's just...

612
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,600
It's new every time.

613
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,145
It's brand-new every night.
It's very, very exciting.

614
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,688
[music stops]

615
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,739
And it's dying.
It's dying, Mia.

616
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,282
It's dying on the vine.

617
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,660
And the world says, "Let it die.
It had its time."

618
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,579
Well, not on my watch.

619
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:11,459
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna have my own club.

620
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,127
- Really?
- Yes.

621
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:16,005
We're gonna play whatever we want,
whenever we want,

622
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:20,301
however we want,
as long as it's pure jazz.

623
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,678
<i>Hi, this is Mia Dolan.</i>

624
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,181
Yeah, I just missed a call.

625
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,850


626
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:35,066
- I got a callback!
- What? Come on!

627
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,525
- [laughs]
- For what?

628
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,654
For a TV show. The one I was
telling you about earlier.

629
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,906
- The <i>"Dangerous Minds</i> meets <i>The O.C."?</i>
- Yeah.

630
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,242
- Congratulations! That's incredible!
- It's really exciting.

631
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,327
I feel like I said negative
stuff about it before.

632
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,454
- What?
- It's like <i>Rebel Without a Cause.</i>

633
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,624
"I got the bullets!"

634
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,210
Yes.

635
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,128
- You've never seen it!
- I've never seen it.

636
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,881
Oh, my! You know,
it's playing at the Rialto.

637
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,091
- Really?
- Yes.

638
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,636
You should go-- I mean,
[stammering] I can take you.

639
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,720
Okay.

640
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,222
- You know, for research.
- For research.

641
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,140
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

642
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,393
Um, Monday night, 10:00.

643
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,270
- Yeah. Great.
- Okay.

644
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:13,729
For research.

645
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:17,483

You either follow my rules
or follow my rules.

- Thanks.

No, that's fine.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

- Hey, babe. Got a space out front.

675
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,477
- [chuckles] Great.
- We should get going.

676
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,103
- Okay.
- My brother landed really early.

677
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,775
- Did you forget? You forgot.
- Shit.

678
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,569
That's tonight.

679
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,946
- That's okay. You forgot.
- Yeah. Okay.

680
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,448
All right, so then
I'll just get changed.

681
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,992
- Okay. Great.
- Okay. Great.

682
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,453
- [cell phone ringing]
- [Greg chuckles]

683
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,787
- Yeah, that's him.
- Um...

684
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,623
Hey, Josh, yeah. Uh...

685
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,709
Just pickin' up Mia.
We'll be there in, like...

686
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,171
[Josh] <i>But now we've got this
surround-sound set-up, so it's like--</i>

687
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,590
- It's like being in a movie theatre.
- Wow.

688
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,091
But better than being
in a theatre, really.

689
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,052
- [Greg] I can't wait.
- You know theatres these days.

690
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,970
- Yeah.
- They're so dirty.

691
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,430
Yeah, I know.
And so smelly.

692
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,098
[Josh] And they're either
too hot or too cold.

693
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,850
[Greg] I know. The quality's
really fallen off.

694
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,353
[Josh] The quality's terrible.
And there's always people talking.

695
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,979
- [Greg] Because--
- Which is just... Oh, it's the worst!

696
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,439
- [cell phone buzzes]
- Oh, I'm sorry.

697
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,233
- Hold on one second.
- [Greg] The texting.

698
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,235
Hello?

699
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:30,861
- Probably work.
- Mmm.

700
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,196
[speaking Mandarin]

701
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,745
- Sorry. So, yeah, we love it.
- Oh, it's so nice.

702
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:43,874
- [Greg] Well, we have to come. Maybe.
- [Josh] You should. Come by.

703
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:50,756
[sighs]

704
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,518
- [Josh] I got one word for you, man.
- [Greg] Mmm-hmm?

705
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,854
- Indonesia.
- Never heard anyone say that.

706
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:09,024
I don't even know. I can't keep track
of it, but honestly, it was life-changing.

707
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,360
- Really?
- Yeah. It affected me.

708
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,946
- It was incredible.
- Is it amazing?

709
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,240
- Yes.
- A 5-star jungle eco-resort

710
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,117
- you would not believe.
- Amazing.

711
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,535
We were thinking about Nicaragua.

712
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,371
The thing about Nicaragua is it's less
developed, it's a little under-developed.

713
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,455
Right.

714
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:27,209
I think there's a little more-- Yeah,
then, I just don't know if it's safe.

715
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:28,961
- Yeah, yeah. It's...
- You know?

716
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,170
Yeah, you don't want
to explore too far.

717
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:31,755
[Josh] Kind of a "natives are
restless" sort of thing.

718
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,048
[slow jazz music playing]

719
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,926
[Josh] Actually, China's going
to build a canal.

720
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,119
I'm sorry.

I have an idea.

What is that?
Is it a script?

741
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,922
It's a play.

742
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:13,842
[Alexis] A play?
You better give us all roles!

743
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:17,763
Actually, it's a one-woman show!
So I can't.

[car horn honks loudly]

Wow. Is that gonna
happen every time?

746
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,272
I think so.

Oh!

Keith.

756
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,329
Come here, man.

757
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,916
- How are you?
- I've been good, man.

758
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,751
This is Mia. Mia, Keith.

759
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,086
Hi, Mia. Nice to meet you.

760
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,713
- Nice to meet you.
- I used to play with this guy.

761
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,382
Went to school together.

762
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,133
- So how you been, brother?
- Great.

763
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:43,635
Never been better.
How 'bout you?

764
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,470
I been really good.
Been very busy.

765
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:48,056
- I got a new combo.
- Okay. Cool.

766
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,557
We're lookin' for keys.

767
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:53,478
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

768
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,438
- No, I'm good.
- Are you sure? It pays.

769
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:58,275
I'm good.

770
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:00,652
Let's just grab a drink then.
It's been too long.

771
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:01,987
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you, Mia.

772
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,488
[Mia] Nice to meet you.

773
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,666
"The end."

774
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,631
- Genius.
- [chuckles] Really?

775
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:23,341
- Yes. Yes.
- Really?

776
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:24,676
It feels really nostalgic to me.

777
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,219
- Is it too nostalgic?
- That's the point.

778
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,722
Are people gonna like it?

779
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,349
- Fuck 'em.
- [laughs] You always say that.

780
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:35,103
- Well, I truly believe it.
- I made you something.

781
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,856
- For what?
- For your club.

782
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:40,984
Why does it say "Seb's"?

783
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,652
'Cause I think you should call it "Seb's."

784
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:43,737
- What?
- 'Cause no one will come

785
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,405
to "Chicken on a Stick."

786
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,407
Is that a music note
as an apostrophe?

787
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,742
- Yes! Yeah.
- That's pretty cool.

788
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,952
It's gotta be "Chicken on a Stick,"

789
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:52,871
because Charlie Parker
got his nickname--

790
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,290
I know, because he loved chicken.

791
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:58,585
- [both laugh]
- That's why they called him "Bird."

792
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,421
So I'm gonna have chicken, beer, jazz.
"Chicken on a Stick."

793
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,799
I know. You should drop the chicken
and just have drinks and jazz, and also--

794
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,969
- I'm not droppin' the chicken.
- You could maybe do it somewhere else.

795
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:09,304
- What are you talk--
- Find a new spot.

796
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,847
It's gotta be the Van Beek.

797
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,223
Well, it doesn't have to be the Van Beek.

798
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,768
I can't let them samba
all over its history.

799
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,770
- [groans]
- I can't do it.

800
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,147
You can let them,
but you refuse to.

801
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,691
Your play's incredible.

802
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:25,945
You know, the whole world
from your bedroom.

803
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:29,032
What else do they want?
Who's doing that?

804
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:32,327
- I'm doing that.
- You're doing that.

805
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:37,624
Who was that guy at The Lighthouse?
The guy that offered you the gig?

806
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,833
- Keith.
- Yeah.

807
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:43,004
- Why was it so weird between you two?
- It's always weird with him.

808
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:44,339
- Really?
- Yeah.

809
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:47,675
But he seemed kinda nice
'cause he did offer you a job.

810
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,889
- Are you gonna call him?
- No. No.

811
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,891
All right.

812
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:58,228
So... Here's what we know.

813
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,105
Yeah?

814
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:03,608
It's definitely
"Chicken on a Stick,"

815
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,735
and your play
is gonna be a triumph.

816
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,949
[Mia] It's a one-woman show,
so it's just me...

817
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,535
No, I mean, I'm acting in it, too.

818
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,832
No, Mum, I'm not getting paid.
I'm paying to do it.

819
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,795
He's great. He's gonna
open his own jazz club.

820
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,505
Yeah, it's gonna be incredible.

821
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,717
No, he hasn't.
He hasn't opened it yet.

822
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:31,052
He needs some...

823
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,933
He's saving up, I think.

824
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,066
No, he doesn't have a steady gig.

825
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,944
But he's figuring it out,
it's just been a little tricky lately.

826
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:55,243
Mum, he's gonna find a way to open it
and you're gonna love it, okay?

827
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,578
How's Dad?

829
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,714
Sebastian.
Come on in, man.

830
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,134
- Thanks for comin'.
- Thanks for having me.

831
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,553
Wasn't sure I'd see you today.

832
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,513
- So... Here's the deal.
- Okay.

833
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,516
We got distribution with Universal.
We've got our own imprint.

834
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,018
About to go on the road.

835
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,145
Uh, we can pay you 1,000 bucks a week,

836
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,356
plus a cut of the ticket revenue
and merchandising.

837
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,066
Sound good?

[clears throat]

839
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,613
- Sebastian? All right.
- Yeah.

840
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:32,947
- Let's play.
- Okay.

through. I didn't know that the band...

what, months now? Years?

This is it.

1011
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:02,983
and now you're gonna be on tour with him
for years, so I just didn't...

1012
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,568
- What are you doing right now?
- ...know if you were happy.

1013
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:05,694
- Why are you doing this?
- I don't...

1014
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,905
- What do you mean, why am I doing this?
- I thought you wanted me to do this.

1015
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:09,740
It just sounds like now
you don't want me to do it.

1016
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,326
What do you mean,
I wanted you to do this?

1017
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,536
This is what you wanted for me.

1018
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:15,662
To be in this band?

1019
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:18,499
To be in a band.
To have a steady job, you know?

1020
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:21,919
To be... You know.

1021
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,962
Of course I wanted you
to have a steady job,

1022
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:26,006
so that you could take care of yourself
and your life

1023
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,341
and you could start your club.

1024
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:29,802
So I'm doing that, so I don't understand.
Why aren't we celebrating?

1025
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,804
Why aren't you starting your club?

1026
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,390
You said yourself no one
wants to go to that club.

1027
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,517
No one wants to go to a club
called "Chicken on a Stick."

1028
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,684
So change the name!

1029
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:39,937
Well, no one likes jazz!
Not even you!

1030
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,855
I do like jazz now because of you!

1031
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:44,358
And this is what I thought
you wanted me to do!

1032
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:47,653
What am I supposed to do?
Go back to playing "Jingle Bells"?

1033
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:48,737
I'm not saying that.

1034
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:49,947
I'm saying why don't you take
what you've made and start the club?

1035
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,699
Scraping pennies so I can start a club
no one wants to go to?

1036
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:55,619
People will want to go to it
because you're passionate about it,

1037
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:57,996
and people love what other people
are passionate about.

1038
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,457
- You remind people of what they forgot.
- Not in my experience.

1039
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:07,798
Well, whatever, all right?
It's just time to grow up, you know?

1040
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,967
I have a steady job,
this is what I'm doing.

1041
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,718
And now all of a sudden
if you had these problems,

1042
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,512
I wish you would have said them earlier,

1043
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,055
before I signed
on the goddamn dotted line!

1044
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:16,849
I'm pointing out that you had a dream

1045
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,684
that you followed,
that you were sticking to...

1046
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,894
This is the dream!
This is the dream.

1047
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:22,229
This is not your dream!

1048
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,565
Guys like me work their whole lives
to be in something

1049
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:27,734
that's successful, that people like.
You know?

1050
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:31,655
I mean, I'm finally in something
that-that-that people enjoy.

1051
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:33,073
Since when do you care
about being liked?

1052
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:34,658
Just 'cause I don't enjoy it,
it doesn't matter.

1053
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,660
Why do you care so much
about being liked?

1054
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:38,745
You're an actress!
What are you talking about?

1055
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:40,664
- [scoffs]
- [music stops]

1056
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,599
Maybe you just liked me
when I was on my ass

1057
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,767
'cause it made you
feel better about yourself.

1058
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:07,816
- Are you kidding?
- No.

1059
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,130
I don't know.

1060
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,845
[smoke alarm beeping]

1061
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:13,882
[sighs]

1062
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,952
[grunts]

1063
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,838
Okay, fellas.
I'll see ya tomorrow.

1064
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,172
- Sebastian?
- Yeah?

1065
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,925
You're good for tonight, right?

1066
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,510
[sighs]
What are you talking about?

1067
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,179
7:00, the photo shoot.

1068
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,515
<i>Mojo</i>. Are you good?

1069
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:09,605
- I thought that was next Thursday.
- No, it's tonight.

1070
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,650
Is that okay?

1071
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:07,621
[camera clicking]

1072
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:09,956
- [music playing]
- [lip-syncing]

1073
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,958
- Give me the other camera!
- What's wrong with that one?

1074
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:15,462
"What's wrong with that one?" It doesn't
bloody work, that's what's wrong with it!

1075
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:17,255
All right, trumpet,
that's lovely.

1076
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:21,927
Lovely! Beautiful, beautiful!

1077
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,262
Okay, keyboard.
Okay, look up.

1078
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:27,349
That's good. That's good,
that's lovely. Lovely.

1079
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:31,269
Okay, cut the music!
That is lovely. That's lovely.

1080
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:35,148
Okay, now bite your lip
like this, sort of like...

1081
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:38,860
like you're concentrating on something,
I don't know, like a piece of your music.

1082
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:40,195
Bite my what?

1083
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:42,155
Your lip. You know,
bite your lip...

1084
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:46,034
Yeah, that's good.
That's great.

1085
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:47,369
Beautiful! Beautiful.

1086
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:50,706
Okay, now just move your glasses
down on... onto the nose...

1087
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:53,417
A little bit further, just a little bit,
a touch further.

1088
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,711
Keep your head down,
but look up at me.

1089
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:57,462
Look sort of moody.

1090
01:26:57,546 --> 01:27:00,173
Yeah! That's beautiful!
That is great!

1091
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:03,260
Okay, turn the keyboard on live!

1092
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:04,678
[muffled] Do you wanna hear
the keyboard then?

1093
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:07,389
You don't have to bite your lip now.

1094
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:09,933
Well, actually play something.

1095
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:12,102
Play something.
You know? Anything.

1096
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:14,938
You're a pianist, aren't you?
Play something.

1097
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:21,111
[playing soft jazz music]

1098
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:29,161
- [camera clicking]
- That's great, that's beautiful.

1099
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,079
That's lovely.
Oh, that's good.

1100
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:33,206
No, don't stop.
Keep playing.

1101
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:35,917
Go on, just keep playing.
That was great!

1102
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:57,939
[cheers]

1103
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:19,085
[man 1] ...shoot myself in the head.
[chuckling]

1104
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:20,712
She's not even good.

1105
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,422
[man 2] That whole window thing...

1106
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:24,925
[man 1] Yeah, what was
that shit with the window?

1107
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:27,636
Oh, my God!
Don't quit your day job.

1108
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,554
Oh, well...

1109
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:32,516
Not good. One-woman shows
are always terrible.

1110
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:34,601


1111
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,358

Mia!

1114
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,711
Mia. I'm so sorry.

1115
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,591
Just tell me how it went.
How was it?

1116
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,135
- Don't help me.
- I'm sorry.

1117
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:11,555
- I'm sorry I've been such a prick.
- You're sorry, you're sorry...

1118
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:14,391
[crying]
You're sorry. You're sorry...

1119
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:18,311
I'm gonna make it up to you.
Let me make it up to you, okay?

1120
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:27,904
- I don't blame you for not wanting--
- It's over.

1121
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,990
- What is?
- It's over. [sighs]

1122
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:31,408
What?

1123
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:34,744
All of this.

1124
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:38,415
I'm done embarrassing myself.
I'm done, I'm done.

1125
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,167
- Nobody showed up.
- So what? So what?

1126
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:43,670
I can't pay back the theatre.
This is so...

1127
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,840
I'm gonna go home for a while.

1128
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:50,677
- I'll come see you tomorrow.
- No, I'm going "home" home.

1129
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,346
- This is home.
- No, it's not anymore.

I was told I might find her here.</i>

- I won't.

Casting is trying to reach her?</i>

[Mia] <i>Why did you come here?</i>

1149

- Because I have good news.
- What?

1150
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:05,747
Amy Brandt,
the casting director?

1151
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,209
- Yeah.
- She was at your play, and she loved it.

1152
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:13,213
And she loved it so much that she wants
you to come in tomorrow

1153
01:33:13,296 --> 01:33:15,965
and audition for this huge movie
that she's got.

1154
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:19,594
I'm not going to that.

1155
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:22,972
- I'm not going to that.
- What?

1156
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:25,767
That one's gonna be...
No. That one's gonna be...

1157
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,102
I'm sorry?

1158
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:29,020
That will kill me.

1159
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:31,940
- What?!
- What?

1160
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,858
What? Shh! Stop!

If you want me to be quiet,
you have to make some goddamn sense!

1164
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,116
- Tell me why you're not going.
- They'll call the police.

1165
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:42,242
- Because. Because...
- Why?

1166
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:44,994
I've been to a million auditions,
and the same thing happens every time

1167
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:47,914
where I get interrupted because someone
wants to get a sandwich!

1168
01:33:47,997 --> 01:33:50,625
Or I'm crying,
and they start laughing!

1169
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:52,752
Or there's people
sitting in the waiting room,

1170
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:57,048
and they're like me, but prettier
and better at the--

1171
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:58,758
Because maybe
I'm not good enough!

1172
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:01,136
- Yes, you are.
- No...

1173

- No, maybe I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:03,930
- Maybe I'm not.
- You are.

1175
01:34:04,013 --> 01:34:05,640
- Maybe I'm not.
- You are.

1176
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:11,813
Maybe I'm one of those people
that has always wanted to do it,

1177
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:15,108
but it's like a pipe dream for me,
you know?

1178
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:16,651
And then, you said it,

1179
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:19,571
you change your dreams,
and then you grow up.

1180
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,823
Maybe I'm one of those people,
and I'm not supposed to.

1181
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:23,950
And I can go back to school,

1182
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:26,161
and I can find something else
I'm supposed to do.

1183
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:30,248
'Cause I left to do that,
and it's been six years,

1184
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:31,916
and I don't want to do it anymore.

1185
01:34:35,628 --> 01:34:36,880
Why?

1186
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:42,093
- Why what?
- Why don't you want to do it anymore?

1187
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:47,056
'Cause I think it hurts
a little bit too much.

1188
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:50,143
You're a baby.

1189
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:51,519
[laughs]

1190
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,104
- I'm not a baby. I'm trying to grow up.
- You are.

1191
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:54,772
- You're crying like a baby.
- [sniffles] Oh, my God.

1192
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:57,942
You have an audition tomorrow at 5:30.

1193
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:00,737
I'll be out front at 8:00 A.M.

1194
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,198
You'll be out front or not,
I don't know.

1195
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,741
[engine starts]

1196
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:06,367
How'd you find me here?

1197
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:09,454
The house
in front of the library.

1198
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:32,185


1199

[engine starting]

1200
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:54,707
- I got coffee.
- Okay, great.

1201
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:14,060
Mia?

1202
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:22,360
Hi, Mia. I'm Amy
and this is Frank.

1203
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:23,736
Hi. How are ya?

1204
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:26,072
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad we found you.

1205
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:27,615
Me, too.

1206
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:33,871
The film shoots in Paris,
and we don't have a script.

1207
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:35,456
[Frank]
It's gonna be a process.

1208
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:37,583
We're gonna build the character
around the actress.

1209
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:40,336
It's a 3-month rehearsal
and a 4-month shoot.

1210
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:44,090
Okay.

1211
01:36:44,173 --> 01:36:47,719
[Amy] And we thought that you
could just tell us a story.

1212
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,053
About?

1213
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:52,807
- You can just tell us anything.
- Anything?

1214
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:55,685
Yeah, just tell us a story.
You're a storyteller.

1215
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:57,895
[chuckles] um...

1216
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:03,026
Whenever you're ready.

1217
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:15,079
My aunt used to live in Paris.

1218
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,085
I remember she used to come home

1219
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:26,424
and she would tell us these stories
about being abroad, and...

1220
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:30,094
I remember...

1221
01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:34,599
She told us that she jumped
into the river once.

 <i>And died with a flicker</i>

Oh, they said the next couple days.

But I'm not expecting
to find anything out.

You're gonna get it.

- I really might not.
- Yes, you are.

I don't think
we can do anything,

- If I get this.
