1
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,750
Tina.

2
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,710
Tina.

3
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,720
Tina.

4
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,200
Tina. Tina.

5
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,400
You okay, Tina?

6
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,030
Just a dream, Ma.

7
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,030
Some dream, judging from that.

8
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,130
- You coming back to the sack or what?
- Hold your horses.

9
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,920
Tina, honey, you gotta cut your fingernails

10
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,090
or you gotta stop that kind of dreaming.

11
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,930
One or the other.

12
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,710
One, two
Freddy's coming for you

13
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,710
Three, four
Better lock your door

14
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,630
Five, six
Grab your crucifix

15
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,310
Seven, eight
Gonna stay up late

16
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,850
Nine, 10
Never sleep again

17
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,980
It was so scary.

18
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,230
When I woke up, it seemed like he was
still in the room.

19
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,110
Sounds like a real boogeyman.
"One, two, Freddy's coming for you. "

20
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,240
That's what it reminded me of:
that old jump-rope song.

21
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,950
The worst nightmare I ever had.
You wouldn't believe it.

22
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,620
Matter of fact,
I had a bad dream last night myself.

23
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,290
I had a hard-on this morning
when I woke up, Tina.

24
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,920
- Had your name written all over it.
- There's four letters in my name, Rod.

25
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,250
How could there be room
on your joint for four letters?

26
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,260
Hey, up yours
with a twirling lawn mower.

27
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,260
Nyah! Rod says the sweetest things.

28
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,180
- Oh, he's nuts about you.
- Yeah, nuts.

29
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,930
Anyway, I couldn't go
back to sleep last night.

30
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,100
- So, what did you dream?
- Forget it, Tina.

31
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,980
The point is that everyone
has a bad dream once in a while.

32
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,440
It's no biggie.

33
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,440
Just tell yourself that's all it is
while you're having it.

34
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,110
Once you do that, you wake right up.
At least it works for me.

35
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,410
Hey! Did you have a nightmare too?

36
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,960
Maybe we're gonna have a big earthquake.
They say things get really weird just before.

37
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,390
I'm so glad you guys
could come over tonight.

38
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,350
When Mom said she was taking off
for two days, I almost died.

39
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,310
No problem, Tina.
Nancy and Glen to the rescue.

40
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,150
Can't believe his mother's letting him
spend the night.

41
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,360
Right, well, she's not, exactly.

42
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,490
I got this cousin who lives near the airport.
It's okay for me to stay with him.

43
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,030
And I got this sound-effects tape
from Rod, and...

44
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,080
Hello, Mom?

45
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,790
Yeah. Out here at Barry's.

46
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,130
Huh? Yeah, noisy as usual.
Glad we don't live here, huh?

47
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,590
Yeah, Aunt Eunice says hello.

48
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,590
Right, right, I'll call you in the morning.
Yeah. Yeah, sure...

49
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,020
Just some kids drag-racing outside,
I think, Mom.

50
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,060
Listen, Ma. I gotta go.
I think there's been an accident out front.

51
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,360
Right.

52
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,400
All right, I'll call the police.

53
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,700
Right, I'll call the police.

54
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,700
No. Just some neighbors
having a fight, I guess.

55
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,040
I'll call you in the morning.

56
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,460
It worked like a charm.

57
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,880
Smooth.

58
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,090
Jesus.

59
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,550
See? I told you you'd be feeling better.

60
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,730
All day long,
I've been seeing that guy's weird face...

61
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,850
...and hearing those fingernails.

62
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,310
Fingernails?

63
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,230
That's amazing, you saying that.

64
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,740
That made me remember
the dream I had last night.

65
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,400
What did you dream?

66
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,410
I dreamed about a guy
in a dirty red and green sweater.

67
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,500
Well, what about the fingernails?

68
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,080
Oh, he scraped
his fingernails along things.

69
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,920
Actually, they were more like
finger-knives or something.

70
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,630
Something he made himself,
but they made a horrible sound.

71
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,470
It was like:

72
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,430
Nancy, you dreamed
about the same creep I did.

73
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,980
That's impossible.

74
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,770
What?

75
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,780
Nothing.

76
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,950
- There's something out there, isn't there?
- I didn't hear anything.

77
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,950
Well, I heard something.

78
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,150
I'm gonna punch out your ugly lights,
whoever you are.

79
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,450
Kitty, kitty.

80
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,670
Chow, chow, chow.

81
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,470
It's Rod Lane bringing Lantz down
just three yards from the goal line!

82
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,180
What a brilliant tackle,
and the fans go wild.

83
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,690
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Came to make up. No big deal.

84
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,610
- Your mom home?
- Course.

85
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,570
- Oh, what's that?
- Intense, huh?

86
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,780
So, what's going on here,
an orgy or something?

87
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,700
Maybe a funeral, dickhead.

88
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,290
It's just a sleepover date, Rod.

89
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,410
Tina and me. Glen was just leaving.

90
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,210
- You see his face?
- "You see his face?"

91
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,720
Your mom ain't home, is she?

92
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,470
Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.

93
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,220
Rod.

94
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,930
We got her mother's bed.
You guys got the rest.

95
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,110
I think we should get out of here.

96
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,070
Hey, you guys are gonna
hang around, right?

97
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,030
I mean, don't leave me alone
with this lunatic.

98
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,570
Please, Nancy?

99
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,830
Glen, not now.

100
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,420
We're here for Tina now, not ourselves.

101
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,630
Why is she so bothered
by a stupid nightmare, anyway?

102
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,840
Because he was scary, that's why.

103
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,360
Yeah.

104
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,450
Oh, Rod!

105
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,120
Yeah. Yeah, Tina!

106
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,460
Oh, God! Oh, God!

107
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,210
Oh, God!

108
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,130
Oh, God! Oh, Rod!

109
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,260
Morality sucks.

110
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,650
I knew there was something about you
I liked.

111
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,820
- You feel better now, right?
- Jungle man fix Jane.

112
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,830
No more fights?

113
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,160
No more fights.

114
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,170
Good.

115
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,880
No more nightmares
for either one of us, then.

116
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,300
When did you have a nightmare?

117
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,010
Guys can have nightmares too,
you know.

118
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,180
You ain't got a corner
on the market or something.

119
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,200
Rod?

120
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,750
Tina.

121
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,820
Tina.

122
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,200
Who do you think you are?

123
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,410
Whoever you are.

124
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,900
Somebody there?

125
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,900
Tina.

126
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,550
Tina.

127
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,220
Who the hell is that?

128
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,750
Tina.

129
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,250
Shit.

130
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,140
Please, God...

131
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,140
This...

132
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,470
...is God.

133
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,400
No! No! No!

134
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,160
Yes!

135
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,580
Tina!

136
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,370
Watch this.

137
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,510
Nancy! Open the door!

138
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,470
Nancy!

139
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,650
Rod, help me! Oh, God!

140
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,780
No! No!

141
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,450
Help me, Rod!

142
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,830
Help me! Rod! Rod!

143
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,330
- Help me!
- Tina!

144
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,150
Tina!

145
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,940
Tina! Tina!

146
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,400
Tina!

147
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,530
- Tina!
- Rod! Rod!

148
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,370
Tina!

149
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,550
- Tina? Tina?
Who did this? I'll kill you.

150
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,630
- Who did this?
- Aaagh! Oh, God, you scared me!

151
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,780
What have you got?

152
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,400
Her name was Tina Gray.
It's her home.

153
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,700
Father abandoned 10 years ago,
mother's in Vegas with her boyfriend.

154
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,240
- We're trying to reach her.
- What's the coroner got?

155
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,750
Something like a razor was the weapon,
but nothing was found at the scene.

156
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,960
It looks like the victim's boyfriend.

157
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,330
Lieutenant.
- Where is she?

158
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,590
- I put her in your office.
- His name's Rod Lane. He's a musician type.

159
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,260
- Arrests for drugs, brawling.
- Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?

160
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,430
She lived there.

161
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,640
I don't mean her.

162
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,680
I mean you.

163
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,770
What was she doing there?

164
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,020
Hello to you too, Donald.

165
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,440
Marge. Okay.

166
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,200
How you doing, baby?

167
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,700
I'm okay, Dad.

168
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,710
Look, I don't wanna
get into this now...

169
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,630
...God knows you need time,
but I sure would like to know...

170
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,960
...what the hell you were doing shacking up
with three kids in the middle of the night...

171
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,340
...especially a lunatic delinquent
like Lane.

172
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,180
Rod is not a lunatic, Dad.

173
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,140
You have a sane explanation
for what he did?

174
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,640
Apparently, he was crazy jealous.

175
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,150
- Nancy said they'd had a fight.
- It wasn't that serious.

176
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,230
Maybe you don't think murder is serious.

177
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,690
How can you say I don't take
her death seriously?

178
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,320
Look, all I meant...

179
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,950
...was that their fights
weren't that serious.

180
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,340
You know, Tina...

181
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
...she dreamed this was gonna happen.

182
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,130
What?

183
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:16,050
She had a nightmare
that someone was trying to kill her.

184
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:22,350
That's why we were there, Mom.
She just didn't wanna sleep alone.

185
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,070
Police say the victim,
15-year-old Christina Gray...

186
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,740
...had quarreled earlier
with her boyfriend, Rod Lane.

187
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,240
Lane is now the subject
of a citywide manhunt.

188
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,500
The murder weapon, a straight razor
or similar sharp object, has not yet...

189
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,340
Where do you think you're going?

190
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,220
School.

191
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,680
You were tossing and turning
all night last night.

192
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,050
You have no business
going to school today.

193
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,020
I've gotta go to school, Mother.
Otherwise I'll sit up there and go crazy.

194
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,180
Did you sleep?

195
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,230
I'll sleep in study hall.

196
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,570
I'd rather keep busy, you know?

197
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,240
- Right home after?
- Right home after.

198
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,700
Okay.

199
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,820
- See you.
- See you.

200
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,320
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

201
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,790
- They're gonna kill me for sure.
- Nobody's gonna kill you.

202
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,460
Did you do it?

203
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,460
- I never touched her.
- You were screaming like crazy.

204
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,470
There was somebody else there.

205
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,800
The door was locked from your side.

206
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,100
Don't look at me like I'm some
fucking fruitcake or something!

207
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,020
- I'm warning you.
- Just move away from her, son.

208
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,150
Real easy,
like your ass depended on it.

209
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,650
Hold it!

210
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,530
- No!
- Jesus Christ.

211
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,370
Hold it right there.

212
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,000
Watch it. Hold them.
- All right. I'm cool, I'm cool.

213
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,290
Okay, I got him.
On the ground, now.

214
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,420
Come on. Get down.
- Lieutenant, look at this. A switchblade.

215
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,300
I didn't do it! I didn't kill her, Nancy!

216
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,710
Daddy?

217
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,840
You used me.

218
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,180
What the hell were you doing
going to school today for anyway?

219
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,390
Nancy.

220
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,060
Nancy!

221
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,350
- Nancy!
Come on, let go of my arm.

222
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,360
What is seen is not always what is real.

223
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,200
According to Shakespeare,
there was something operating in nature...

224
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,740
...perhaps inside human nature itself,
that was rotten.

225
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,040
A canker, as he put it.

226
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,040
Now, of course,
Hamlet's response to this...

227
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:33,380
...and to his mother's lies,
was to continually probe and dig.

228
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,260
Just like the gravediggers...

229
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,720
...always trying to get
beneath the surface.

230
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,560
The same is true in a different way
in Julius Caesar. John, go ahead, please.

231
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:58,240
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
a little ere the mightiest Julius fell.

232
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,330
The graves stood tenantless,
and the sheeted dead...

233
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,620
...did squeak and gibber
in the Roman streets:

234
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,410
As stars with trains of fire
and dews of blood...

235
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,750
...disasters in the sun, and the moist star...

236
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,750
...upon whose influence
Neptune's empire stands...

237
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,260
Nancy.

238
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,640
Nancy.

239
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,940
O God! I could be bounded in a nutshell...

240
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,070
...and count myself a king
of infinite space...

241
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,030
...were it not that I have bad dreams.

242
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Tina?

243
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,330
- Where's your pass?
- Screw your pass.

244
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,790
Hey, Nancy.

245
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,170
No running in the hallway.

246
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,690
Tina?

247
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,020
Tina?

248
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:52,540
Tina?

249
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,630
Who are you?

250
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,140
Gonna get you.

251
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,240
- It's only a dream!
- Come to Freddy.

252
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,860
Goddamn you!

253
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,250
No! No!

254
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,750
Okay! Okay, okay! Thompson!

255
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,340
I'll call your mother.

256
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,840
Everything is all right now.

257
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,840
- Come on. Sit down.
- No.

258
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,220
I'm okay. I'm fine.

259
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,100
You sure?
- Yeah. I'll go straight home.

260
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,400
You'll need a hall pass.

261
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,190
Back to work.

262
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,470
God!

263
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:38,580
- And then what happened?
- I told you.

264
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,050
It was dark, but I'm sure
there was somebody in there...

265
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,630
...under the covers with her.

266
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,890
How could somebody be under the covers
with you without you knowing about it?

267
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,930
How the fuck do I know?

268
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,980
I don't expect you to believe me anyway.

269
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,480
What did he look like?

270
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,610
Did you get a look at him?

271
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,570
No.

272
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,490
Well, then how do you know
that somebody else was there?

273
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,620
Because somebody cut her
while I watched.

274
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,710
- And you didn't get a look at him?
- I couldn't even see the fucker.

275
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,000
You could just see...

276
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,960
...cuts happening...

277
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,170
...all at once.

278
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,430
What do you mean all at once?

279
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,310
I mean, it was as if
there were four razors...

280
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,640
...cutting her at the same time...

281
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,980
...but invisible ones.

282
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,230
You know,
I probably could have saved her...

283
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,280
...if I'd have moved sooner...

284
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,780
...but I thought it was
just another nightmare...

285
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,870
...like the one I had the night before.

286
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,170
There was this... There was this guy.

287
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,670
He had knives for fingers.

288
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,890
Hey, you think I did it?

289
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,810
No.

290
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,670
One, two
Freddy's coming for you

291
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:48,510
Three, four
Better lock your door

292
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,220
Five, six
Grab your crucifix

293
00:31:54,390 --> 00:32:00,350
Seven, eight
Gonna stay up late

294
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Nine, 10
Never sleep again

295
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,590
Nancy?
- What, Mother?

296
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,470
Don't fall asleep in there.

297
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,800
- You could drown, you know.
- Oh, for Pete's sakes.

298
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,300
It happens all the time.

299
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,310
I've heated up some warm milk for you.

300
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,810
Warm milk? Gross.

301
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,970
Help!

302
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,850
Nancy!

303
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,320
- Hold on, baby!
- Mom!

304
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,660
I'm okay.

305
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,330
- You're okay?
- I'm okay.

306
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,830
But I heard you screaming.
You were calling me.

307
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,630
I just slipped
getting out of the tub, Mom.

308
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,340
I told you hundreds of people a year
get killed like that, honey.

309
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,930
I know, but I'm okay, Mother.
I'm sorry for scaring you.

310
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,640
It's okay.

311
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,510
I'll turn down your bed, okay?

312
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,390
All right. I'll get my pajamas on.

313
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,850
Okay.

314
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,290
all-consuming act
of bodily dismemberment.

315
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,050
No! No!

316
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,290
Hi.
- God!

317
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,300
I'm sorry. Your light was on.
I thought I'd see how you were.

318
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,090
Sometimes I wish
you didn't live right across the street.

319
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,340
Will you shut up and let me in?
Ever stand on a trellis in your bare feet?

320
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,050
Get inside before somebody sees you.

321
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,600
I hit my head.

322
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,390
Gotta be quiet.
Mom's not even asleep yet.

323
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,270
If you don't mind.

324
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,490
I heard you freaked out
in English class today.

325
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,620
- Yeah, I guess I did.
- You haven't slept yet, have you?

326
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,630
- Not really.
- What did you do to your arm?

327
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,170
I burned it in English class.

328
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,800
Oh, God. I look 20 years old.

329
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,640
Did you have
any weird dreams last night?

330
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,270
Slept like a rock.

331
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:10,150
Do you believe that people can dream
about what's going to happen?

332
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,320
- No.
- Do you believe in the boogeyman?

333
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,740
No.

334
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,620
Rod killed Tina, and you know that.

335
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,040
I've got a crazy favor to ask you.

336
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,880
- uh-oh.
- It's nothing hard or anything.

337
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,510
I'm gonna go and look for somebody...

338
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,510
...and I want you to stand
like a sort of a guard, okay?

339
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,060
- Okay?
- Okay.

340
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:46,520
Now, you can't mess up.
A lot might depend on this.

341
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,360
I won't screw up.

342
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,070
Okay, turn off the light.

343
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,530
- Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
- It's dark in here.

344
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,290
And it's not what you're thinking.

345
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,090
Glen?

346
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,970
Are you still watching?

347
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,180
- Yeah, so?
- I'm just checking.

348
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,360
Glen!

349
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,360
Glen?

350
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,120
Glen!

351
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:52,750
Rod! Watch out! Rod! Watch out!

352
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,420
Glen!

353
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,890
- Glen!
Nancy.

354
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,480
Nancy.

355
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,860
Glen!

356
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,120
Wake up!

357
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,830
Are you there?

358
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,500
I'm here.

359
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:03,820
Nancy, help me, please.

360
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,740
- Save me from...
- Freddy.

361
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,710
Glen!

362
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,930
This is just a dream. This isn't real.
This is just a dream. He isn't real. He isn't...

363
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,450
Glen!

364
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:56,830
No!

365
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,840
Glen, no!

366
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,860
Glen, you bastard.

367
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:18,860
What did I do?

368
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,860
I just asked you to do one thing,
just stay awake and watch me...

369
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,950
...just wake me up if it looked
like I was having a bad dream...

370
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:31,410
...and what did you do?
You shithead. You fell asleep.

371
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,040
Nancy?
Oh, shit.

372
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,750
Hurry.

373
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,590
Shut up and stay there.
Don't go away.

374
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,140
Are you okay?

375
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,770
Yeah. It was just a little dream.
I'm going right back to sleep.

376
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,600
Okay. Call me if you need anything, okay?

377
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,600
Okay.

378
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,910
Glen.

379
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,920
- You mind telling me what's going on?
- Oh, just come on.

380
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,080
Yeah.

381
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:21,510
Garcia, I've gotta see Rod Lane again.

382
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,050
You know, I took the night shift
so I could get some peace and quiet.

383
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,430
Look, it's urgent!

384
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,820
We have reason to believe there might
be something strange going on here.

385
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,450
Got no argument with that.

386
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,280
What are you doing here?

387
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:53,370
There's an unsolved murder,
and I don't like unsolved murders.

388
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,670
Especially ones that my daughter's
mixed up in.

389
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,130
What are you doing here?

390
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:01,000
- At this hour, you should be home in bed.
- I just wanna see if he's okay.

391
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:04,300
Nancy, take my word for it.
The guy's sleeping like a baby.

392
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,590
He's not going anywhere.

393
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,640
Just go down and look at him.

394
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,480
Please, Daddy.

395
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:25,030
All right. Garcia, give me the keys.

396
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,320
All right.

397
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,030
Where the hell did I put the keys?

398
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,340
Hey, hey!

399
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:53,020
Help! Help! Help!

400
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,020
Jesus!

401
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,360
Rod!

402
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,780
Hurry. Cut him down.

403
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,830
Grab his legs.
I got him.

404
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
God!

405
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,210
Goddamn crazy kid.

406
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,170
Grab his back, would you?
- Got it.

407
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,510
Lower him.

408
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:50,910
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

409
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,620
May God be
with this young man's soul.

410
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,170
His life and his death
attest to the scriptures' warning...

411
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,750
...that he who lives by the sword
shall die by the sword.

412
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,260
But let us recall also
our Lord's admonition...

413
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,310
...that we judge not, lest we be judged.

414
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,310
And may Rod Lane rest in peace.

415
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,440
Time to go, honey.

416
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,450
Hop in.

417
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,960
The killer's still loose, you know.

418
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,460
You're saying somebody else
killed Tina. Who?

419
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,840
I don't know who he is...

420
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:50,180
...but he's burned,
and he wears a weird hat...

421
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,850
...and a red and green sweater,
really dirty...

422
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,640
...and he uses these knives,
like giant fingernails.

423
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,990
Better keep her home for a few days,
until she gets over the shock of this.

424
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,490
I've got something better.
I'm going to get her some help.

425
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:39,060
I don't see why you couldn't just
give me a pill to keep me from dreaming.

426
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:43,150
Everyone's got to dream, young lady.
If you don't dream, you go.

427
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,400
Okay, all set?

428
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:51,360
- No.
- Please, Nancy, trust us.

429
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:54,700
It's not you I don't trust. It's just...

430
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,000
Okay.

431
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,040
Let's do it.

432
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,050
Thank you, nurse.

433
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,570
How long has this been going on?
- Since the murders.

434
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,830
She was fine before that.

435
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,330
Now she thinks her dreams are real.

436
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,500
Well, there's no sign of pathology
in her EEG.

437
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,080
I'd guess that what we have
is just a normal girl...

438
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,090
...who happens to have gone
through two days of hell.

439
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,260
Okay.

440
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,770
She's asleep now.

441
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,930
Thank God.

442
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,270
What the hell are dreams anyway?

443
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,740
Mysteries. Incredible body hocus-pocus.

444
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:16,320
The truth is we still don't know
what they are or where they come from.

445
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,670
Okay. She's going into deep sleep now.

446
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,130
Heart rate is a little high.
It's just due to anxiety.

447
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,970
Otherwise she's nicely relaxed.

448
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:40,470
All signs are normal.
She could dream at any time now.

449
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:46,190
Beta waves are slowing.

450
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:53,650
She's into REMs now.

451
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:56,990
She's definitely dreaming now.

452
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,830
It's a good one too.
Typical dream parameter.

453
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:06,080
A nightmare now
would be plus or minus five or six.

454
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:09,420
She's about three.

455
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,850
- Doctor, what's she doing now?
- I'm not...

456
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:20,180
Is she asleep or awake?

457
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,730
Something's wrong.
It never gets this high.

458
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:26,270
- What's she doing?
- I don't know.

459
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,730
Is she dreaming?

460
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,030
Listen...
- Nancy! Nancy, it's Mom, it's Mom.

461
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,370
Nancy. It's Mom.

462
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,000
What? Her hair.

463
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,250
- Excuse me.
This'll help you sleep.

464
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,050
No!

465
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:52,710
Oh, my God, her arm!
Get something.

466
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,340
What happened, baby? What happened?

467
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,140
It's okay, it's okay.

468
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,060
I brought something out from my dream.

469
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,270
Where did you get that?

470
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,490
I grabbed it off his head.

471
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,040
Donald, she said she grabbed it
off his head in her dream.

472
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,750
No, I'm not crazy.

473
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,630
I'm holding the damn thing
right here in my hand.

474
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:40,100
I don't know where she really found it.
I gotta go.

475
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,280
You didn't sleep at all last night,
did you?

476
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,660
- The doctor says you have to sleep, or...
- I'll go even crazier?

477
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:04,580
I don't think you're crazy,
and stop drinking that damn coffee.

478
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:12,460
So did you ask Daddy
to have the hat examined?

479
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,010
I threw that filthy thing away.

480
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:19,470
I don't know where you found it
or what you're trying to prove...

481
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:24,060
What I learned in the dream clinic,
that's what I'm trying to prove, Mother.

482
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,310
Rod didn't kill Tina,
and he didn't hang himself.

483
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,770
It's this guy.

484
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,320
He's after us in our dreams.

485
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:41,330
That's just not reality, Nancy.

486
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:43,660
It's real, Mama.

487
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:44,950
Feel it.

488
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,330
- Give me that damn thing.
- It even has his name written in it.

489
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,590
Fred Krueger, Mom.

490
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,840
Fred Krueger.

491
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:57,380
Do you know who that is, Mother?
Because if you do, you better tell me...

492
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,220
...because he's after me now.

493
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:02,930
Nancy, trust your mother
for once, please.

494
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,270
You'll feel better
when you get some sleep.

495
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,310
Feel better?

496
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,230
You call this feeling better?

497
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,860
Or maybe I should grab that bottle
and veg out with you.

498
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,740
Avoid everything happening to me
by just getting good and loaded.

499
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,920
Fred Krueger can't come
after you, Nancy.

500
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,460
He's dead. Believe me. I know.

501
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:37,050
You knew about him all this time...

502
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,550
...and you've been acting
like it was something I made up?

503
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,220
Nancy, you're sick.

504
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:46,890
There's something wrong with you.
You're imagining things.

505
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:51,480
You'll feel better when you sleep.
It's just as simple as that.

506
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:53,320
Screw sleep!

507
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,950
Nancy, it's just a nightmare.

508
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,580
That's enough.

509
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,590
Whenever I get nervous, I eat.

510
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,590
And if you can't do that, you sleep.

511
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,720
I used to.

512
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,600
Not anymore.

513
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,270
Did you ever read about
the Balinese way of dreaming?

514
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,560
No.

515
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,280
They got this whole system
they call dream skills.

516
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,860
So if you have a nightmare, for instance,
like falling, right?

517
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:43,570
- Right.
- Well...

518
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,790
...instead of screaming
and getting all nuts...

519
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,120
...you say, "Okay, I'm gonna
make up my mind...

520
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,120
...that I fall into a magic world. "

521
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:56,460
Make it something special
like a poem or a song.

522
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,470
They get their art and literature
from dreams.

523
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:03,390
Just wake up and write it down.
Dream skills.

524
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,350
Well, what if they meet a monster
in their dreams? Then what?

525
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,810
They turn their back on it.
Take away its energy and it disappears.

526
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:13,150
But what happens
if they don't do that?

527
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,320
Well, I guess those people
don't wake up to tell what happens.

528
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:19,150
Great.

529
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,700
"Booby Traps and Improvised
Anti-personnel Devices"?

530
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,080
Well, what are you reading that for?

531
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,580
I'm into survival.

532
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:37,250
- See you.
You're starting to scare me.

533
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,560
Oh, gross.

534
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,380
Mother!

535
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,930
What's with the bars?

536
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,640
- Security.
- Security?

537
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:37,320
- Security from what?
- Not from what, from whom.

538
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:42,780
Come down to the cellar with me
and I'll tell you.

539
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,300
You wanna know who Fred Krueger was?

540
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:11,890
He was a filthy child murderer who killed
at least 20 kids in the neighborhood.

541
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,690
Kids we all knew.

542
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,560
Oh, Mom.

543
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,940
It drove us crazy
when we didn't know who it was...

544
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,990
...but it was even worse
after they caught him.

545
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,620
Did they put him away?

546
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:37,420
The lawyers got fat
and the judge got famous...

547
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:40,880
...but somebody forgot to
sign the search warrant in the right place...

548
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:42,970
...and Krueger was free, just like that.

549
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,970
What did you do, Mother?

550
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,600
A bunch of us parents tracked him down
after they let him out.

551
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:56,900
We found him in an old abandoned
boiler room where he used to take his kids.

552
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,980
Go on.

553
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,860
We took gasoline...

554
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:09,620
...we poured it all around the place
and made a trail of it out the door...

555
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,870
...then lit the whole thing up
and watched it burn.

556
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,460
But he can't get you now.

557
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:27,390
He's dead, honey,
because Mommy killed him.

558
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,770
I even took his knives.

559
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,480
So it's okay now.

560
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,120
You can sleep.

561
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,380
- Hello.
Hi.

562
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:05,050
- Oh, hi, how you doing?
- Fine.

563
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,590
Stand by your window so I can see you.
You sound a million miles away.

564
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,060
That's much better.

565
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:18,560
I see your mom went ape
at the security store today.

566
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:20,650
You look like the Prisoner of Zenda.

567
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,280
- How long's it been since you slept?
- It's coming up on the seventh day.

568
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,490
It's okay. I checked Guinness.
The record's 11.

569
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:31,240
Listen, Glen. I know who he is.

570
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:33,450
- Who?
- The killer.

571
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,080
- You do?
- Yes.

572
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,870
And if he gets me,
I'm pretty sure you're next.

573
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,330
Me? Why would anybody wanna kill me?

574
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:44,210
Don't ask.
Just give me some help nailing the guy...

575
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,590
...when I bring him out.

576
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,680
- Bring him out of what?
- My dream.

577
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:52,930
- How do you plan to do that?
- Just like I did the hat.

578
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,430
Have a hold of the sucker
when you wake me up.

579
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,520
What...? Wait a minute.

580
00:59:57,690 --> 00:59:59,520
You can't bring somebody
out of a dream.

581
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:03,980
If I can't, then you can all relax,
because it's just a case of me being nuts.

582
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:07,450
Yeah, well, I can save you the trouble.
You're nutty as a fruitcake.

583
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:10,660
- I love you anyway.
- Good.

584
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,290
Then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy
when I bring him out.

585
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:16,500
- What?
- You heard me.

586
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,330
I grab the guy in my dream.
You see me struggling, so you wake me up.

587
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,500
We both come out, you whack the fucker,
and we got him.

588
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:25,420
Are you crazy? Hit him with what?

589
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:28,800
You're the jock.
You have a baseball bat or something.

590
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,050
Just meet me at my porch at midnight.

591
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:36,020
- Oh, and meanwhile...
- Meanwhile?

592
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:41,560
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.

593
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,740
Midnight?

594
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,080
Oh, man.

595
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,870
Midnight.

596
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,290
Baseball bats and boogeymen.

597
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,250
Beautiful.

598
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,580
Glen. Honey?

599
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,710
Glen.

600
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:43,590
Glen. Glen.

601
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,720
How can you listen to television
and hear your records at the same time?

602
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,550
Oh, I wasn't listening to the tube, Ma.
Just watching.

603
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,100
Miss Nude America
is gonna be on tonight.

604
01:01:57,850 --> 01:02:01,560
- How can you hear what she's going to say?
- Who cares what she says?

605
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:04,310
Don't be such a smart guy.

606
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,530
I want you to go to bed.
It's almost midnight.

607
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:11,950
Goodness knows we've all
had a lot to deal with these last few days.

608
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:17,410
- I will, Mom. You guys turning in?
- Pretty soon. Now get to bed.

609
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:32,050
It's over now, baby.
The nightmare's over.

610
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,930
Please.

611
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,390
Okay.

612
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,930
You shouldn't stare.

613
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:59,930
You know what I think?

614
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,310
I think that kid is some kind of lunatic
or something.

615
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:08,070
Oh, you shouldn't talk that way
about that poor child.

616
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:10,360
You mean those bars?

617
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:14,490
Marge is just being cautious,
what with her being all alone...

618
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:19,200
...and Nancy acting so nervous lately.

619
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:20,870
I don't care what you say.

620
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,290
I don't want that kid
hanging around with our son anymore.

621
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,680
Glen, answer the phone.

622
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,260
Hello.

623
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,940
Just a minute. It's her.
She wants to talk to Glen.

624
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:29,980
About what?

625
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,280
What's this about, Nancy?

626
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,110
Just a minute.

627
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:41,330
She says it's private, very private
and very important.

628
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:44,960
Give me that. Glen's asleep.
You'll have to talk to him tomorrow.

629
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,080
You've just gotta be firm
with these kids, that's all. Let's go.

630
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,290
As a matter of fact...

631
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:02,470
Damn.

632
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:10,730
Glen. Don't fall asleep.

633
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:23,040
Glen?

634
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,420
No!

635
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:36,670
Oh, brilliant.

636
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:41,140
What if Glen tries to call?

637
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:18,720
- Hello.
I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy.

638
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:32,480
My boyfriend.

639
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:44,080
- Mom!
- Locked, locked, locked, locked.

640
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,200
I locked it all up. I had to.

641
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:52,080
Nancy, you are going to
get some sleep tonight if it kills me.

642
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,090
Give me the key, Mother.

643
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:59,090
I can't. I don't even have it on me. See?

644
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,260
Damn it!

645
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:10,600
ANNOuNCER
It is now 12 midnight...

646
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:15,150
...and this is Station KRGR
leaving the air.

647
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:24,200
No! No! No! Ma!

648
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,290
Glen! Glen!

649
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:08,580
Come on, Frankie.
Give me a hand. Come on.

650
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:13,380
You won't need a stretcher up there.
You'll need a mop.

651
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,420
Let's go. Let's go.

652
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,550
Hey!

653
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,810
Don't tell me it's another one.

654
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:27,680
Lieutenant, I'm sorry to wake you...

655
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:30,180
...but I've never seen anything
like this before...

656
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:33,770
...and this is your neighborhood,
so I thought I'd better call right away.

657
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:36,690
The coroner's upstairs now,
but I don't think he's gonna...

658
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,880
Would have woke me up.

659
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,960
Oh, my God.

660
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:01,680
Hello?

661
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,720
Yeah, I'll get him right away.

662
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:06,850
Lieutenant, it's your daughter.

663
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:18,480
- Nancy.
- Hi, Daddy.

664
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:23,200
- I know what happened.
- I haven't been upstairs yet.

665
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,030
Yeah, but you know he's dead, right?

666
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,290
Yeah. Apparently he's dead.

667
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,710
Listen, Daddy.
I've got a proposition for you.

668
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,290
- Listen very carefully, please.
- Nancy.

669
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:40,010
I'm gonna go
and get the guy who did it...

670
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:44,430
...and I want you to be there to arrest him
when I bring him out, okay?

671
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,760
Just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.

672
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,480
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy,
and only I can get him.

673
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,440
It's my nightmare he comes to.

674
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:59,940
Just come here and break the door down
in exactly 20 minutes.

675
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:03,110
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, sure.

676
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,990
That'll be exactly half past midnight.

677
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:12,660
Time... Time enough for me
to fall asleep and find him.

678
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:15,420
Honey, look, you just do that.
Get yourself some sleep.

679
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:18,460
- That's what I've been telling you.
- But you'll be here?

680
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:22,090
- They're waiting for you upstairs.
- Yeah. Sure, I'll be there, sweetheart.

681
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:26,220
Now, look, you just get yourself
some rest, please. Deal?

682
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:29,390
- Deal.
- I love you, sweetheart.

683
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,980
Look, go outside
and watch my daughter's house.

684
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:39,440
- If you see anything funny, call me.
- Anything funny? Like what?

685
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:43,780
I don't know. One thing for sure,
I don't want her coming over here.

686
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,910
She's too far gone
to be able to handle this.

687
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:09,950
- What the hell did that, lieutenant?
- I don't know.

688
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:14,950
- What's the coroner got to say?
- He's in the john puking since he saw it.

689
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,130
I guess I should have
told you about him then.

690
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:26,510
Let's just get some sleep, Mom.
It's gonna be okay.

691
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,680
I was just trying to protect you.

692
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:33,640
I didn't see
how much you needed to know.

693
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:40,270
You face things. That's your nature.

694
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,860
That's your gift...

695
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:46,650
...but sometime
you have to turn away too.

696
01:13:58,580 --> 01:13:59,880
I love you.

697
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:06,130
I love you too, baby.

698
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:22,480
Night.

699
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:30,030
Okay, Krueger.

700
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:32,870
We play in your court.

701
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:53,050
And now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep...

702
01:14:53,220 --> 01:15:00,020
...and if I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

AuTOMATED VOICE: Countdown mode.
Ten minutes and counting.

704
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:22,960
What if they meet a monster
in their dreams? Then what?

705
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:26,260
They turn their back on it.
Take away its energy and it disappears.

706
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,260
But what happens if they don't do that?

707
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:31,680
Well, then I guess those people
don't wake up to tell what happens.

708
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:51,590
Nancy.

709
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,770
You dreamed about the same creep I did.

710
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,400
Gonna get you.

711
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:20,540
No! No! No!

712
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:31,010
Nancy.

713
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:08,500
Krueger!

714
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:13,130
I'm here!

715
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:03,500
Come out and show yourself,
you bastard!

716
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:09,750
Shit.

717
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:16,300
Come on, Krueger! Follow me!

718
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:24,770
Damn it!

719
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,850
Where are you?

720
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,900
Where are you, Krueger?

721
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:34,360
I know you're here.

722

AuTOMATED VOICE:
Final 10 seconds.

723

Nine, eight, seven, six...

724
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:42,200
Nancy.

725
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:47,330
I got you now!

726
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:18,910
I'm crazy after all.

727
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,960
It's on, Krueger!

728
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:37,720
Take it down! Come and get me!

729
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:42,300
Help! I've got him! Hey, Daddy!

730
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:46,310
I've got him trapped!
Help! Where are you?

731
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:50,270
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's under control!

732
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,860
Get my dad, you asshole!

733
01:21:56,530 --> 01:21:58,530
Daddy!

734
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:05,700
Come on! He's in here!

735
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:07,660
Don't let him kill me too!

736
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:25,350
Come on, Freddy. Can't you catch me?

737
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:30,520
I'm gonna split you in two.

738
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:42,240
Help! Daddy, help me, please!

739
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:44,490
Maybe I better go tell the lieutenant.

740
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:57,840
I'll kill you slow.

741
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,840
Now, where are you?

742
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:04,510
Hey!

743
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:09,270
No! No, no! No!

744
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,220
Daddy, I did it! Please hurry!

745
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:43,010
Daddy!

746
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:45,430
Where are you?

747
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:50,020
Parker, I need some help here!

748
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:53,310
Okay, you guys. Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Al, Jim, get over here.

749
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:56,070
- Nancy!
Daddy!

750
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,690
- Daddy!
Get you out.

751
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:02,200
Open the door!
Watch yourself, lieutenant.

752
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,410
I got it.

753
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:06,450
Dad, it's Krueger!
Get out of the way.

754
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:10,000
Nancy.

755
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,210
This way, guys. Come down here.

756
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:17,090
What the hell came through here?
As if I know.

757
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:18,590
Oh, my God.

758
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,720
Nancy, what the hell is going on?

759
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,510
Parker, get up here!

760
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:26,970
- We got a fire up here too.
Okay, yeah, we're on our way up.

761
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:32,190
What the hell is going on, Nancy?

762
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:34,310
He's after Mother!

763
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,790
Daddy! Watch out! He's under there!

764
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:11,680
Mother! Mother, Mother!

765
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:18,360
Now do you believe me?

766
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:21,690
They've got the fires out downstairs.

767
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:23,820
Everything okay up here?

768
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:36,750
I'm okay.

769
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:40,800
You go downstairs.

770
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:43,630
I'll be there in a minute.

771
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,430
Lieutenant, is everything all right?

772
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,140
I don't know. I don't know.

773
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:25,800
I know you're there, Freddy.

774
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,600
You think you was
gonna get away from me?

775
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:35,980
I know you too well now, Freddy.

776
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:40,770
Now you die.

777
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:44,900
It's too late, Krueger.

778
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:47,870
I know the secret now.

779
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:52,790
This is just a dream. You're not alive.

780
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:56,670
This whole thing is just a dream.

781
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,090
I want my mother and friends again.

782
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:03,010
You what?

783
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:07,760
I take back every bit of energy
I gave you.

784
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:10,930
You're nothing.

785
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:14,480
You're shit.

786
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:29,320
God.

787
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:32,740
It's bright.

788
01:27:34,830 --> 01:27:37,330
It's gonna burn off soon,
or it wouldn't be so bright.

789
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:41,460
- Feeling better?
- Oh, I feel like a million bucks.

790
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:45,590
They say you've bottomed out
when you can't remember the night before.

791
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:50,720
You know, baby, I'm gonna stop drinking.
I just don't feel like it anymore.

792
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:53,010
Did I keep you awake last night?

793
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:55,890
You look a little bit peaked.

794
01:27:56,140 --> 01:28:00,440
No. I guess I just slept heavy.

795
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:04,400
Okay. I'll see you.

796
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,280
See you.

797
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:11,410
Stop it.
Hi, everybody.

798
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:16,000
You believe this fog?
- Oh, I believe anything is possible.

799
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:18,960
Bye.
Looking good, girl.

800
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:21,920
Hey!
- What happened?

801
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:25,170
What's going on?

802
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,800
- Hey. Hey, I'm not doing this.
Glen! Let us out!

803
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,470
- I'm not doing this.
- What's going on with the window?

804
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,510
No, Mother!

805
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:40,190
- Mother! Mother! Mother!
What's going on?

806
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:49,200
One, two
Freddy's coming for you

807
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:59,290
Three, four
Better lock your door

808
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:04,550
Five, six
Grab your crucifix

809
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:10,590
Seven, eight
Gonna stay up late

810
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:17,560
Nine, 10
Never sleep again
