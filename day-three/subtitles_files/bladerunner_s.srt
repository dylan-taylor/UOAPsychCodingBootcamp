2
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,800
I hope you don't mind me
taking the liberty.

3
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,140
I was careful not to drag in any dirt.

4
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,020
I don't mind the dirt.

5
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,690
I do mind...

6
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,620
...unannounced visits.

7
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,710
You police?

8
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,420
Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?

9
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,710
- I'm a farmer.
- I saw that.

10
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,720
What do you farm?

11
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,850
It's a protein farm.

12
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,230
Wallace design.

13
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,190
Is that what I smell?

14
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,490
Grow that just for me.

15
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,140
Garlic.

16
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,660
Garlic.

17
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,240
Go on, try some.

18
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,790
No, thank you.

19
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,570
I prefer to keep an empty stomach
until the hard part of the day is done.

20
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,040
How long you been here?

21
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,340
Since 2020.

22
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,830
But you haven't always been a farmer,
have you?

23
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,850
Your bag.

24
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,130
It's colonial medical use.

25
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,560
Military issue.

26
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,180
Where were you? Calantha?

27
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,950
Must have been brutal.

28
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,410
Plan on taking me in?

29
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,540
Let them take a look inside?

30
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,000
Mr. Morton...

31
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,330
...if taking you in is an option...

32
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,500
...I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

33
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,420
I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

34
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,920
I'm sorry it had to be me.

35
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,050
Good as any.

36
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,820
Now, if you don't mind...

37
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,450
...if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

38
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,090
Please don't get up.

39
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,510
How's it feel killing your own kind?

40
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,770
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

41
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,820
Only older models do.

42
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,790
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...

43
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,450
...because you've never seen a miracle.

44
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,800
Just photograph everything.

45
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,920
Madam, please.

46
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,650
Incoming L.A.P.D. re-codec hash.

47
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,070
You're hurt. I'm not paying for that.

48
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,060
- I'll glue it.
- And?

49
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,790
One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.

50
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,580
He looks like he could take
your head off.

51
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,950
He tried.

52
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,880
He went AWOL after Calantha...

53
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,340
...with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closing out.

54
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,380
- Just him?
- Just him.

55
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,710
Come on home for your baseline.

56
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,680
One moment, madam.

57
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,690
Thirty meters to maximum depth.

58
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,780
What is that?

59
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,090
I'll send a dig team.

60
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,080
Come on home before the storm.

61
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,950
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

62
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,300
- Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.

63
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,680
Recite your baseline.

64
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,340
And blood-black nothingness
began to spin.

65
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,390
A system of cells interlinked
within cells...

66
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,610
...interlinked within cells
interlinked within one stem.

67
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,900
Fuck off, skin-job.

68
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:32,450
And dreadfully distinct against the dark,
a tall white fountain played.

69
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,440
- Cells.
- Cells.

70
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,570
Have you ever been
in an institution? Cells.

71
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,990
- Do they keep you in a cell? Cells.
- Cells.

72
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,040
When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

73
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,920
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

74
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,250
What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love? Interlinked.

75
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,550
Did they teach you how to feel
finger to finger? Interlinked.

76
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,670
Do you long for having
your heart interlinked? Interlinked.

77
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,210
- Do you dream about being interlinked?
- Interlinked.

78
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,230
What's it like to hold your child
in your arms? Interlinked.

79
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,480
Do you feel that there's a part of you
that's missing? Interlinked.

80
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,060
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within cells interlinked.

81
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,440
Why don't you say that three times?

82
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,490
Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.

83
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,320
Within cells interlinked.

84
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,150
We're done.

85
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,530
Constant K.

86
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,910
You can pick up your bonus.

87
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,200
Thank you, sir.

88
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,250
Caution, keep clear.

89
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,090
Caution, keep clear.

90
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Caution, keep clear.

91
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,430
Connect to Off-world any time,
any place.

92
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,010
Packages start at 20 minutes.

93
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,470
Many options available.

94
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,110
Joi goes anywhere you want her to go.

95
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,110
Connect to Off-world any time,
any place.

96
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,240
Packages start at 20 minutes.

97
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,190
K? I didn't hear you. You're early.

98
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,330
You want me to come back?

99
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,740
- Just go scrub.
- Yes, ma'am.

100
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
How was your meeting?

101
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,760
The usual.

102
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,080
How was your day?

103
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,600
I'm getting cabin fever.

104
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,170
99.9 percent detoxified water.

105
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,940
I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

106
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,230
I'm sure I can fix that for you.
Let me take a look at it.

107
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,160
I need a drink.

108
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,450
- Do you want a drink first?
- Pour me one, will you?

109
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,550
I'm trying a new recipe.
I just need a bit more practice.

110
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,760
Don't fuss.

111
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,500
I should have marinated it longer.
I hope it isn't dry.

112
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:50,520
Did you know this song was released
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

113
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,220
It was number one on the charts.

114
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,230
It won't be much longer.
Just putting on the finishing touches.

115
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,750
Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

116
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,490
I told you not to fuss.

117
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,510
And yet...

118
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,590
VoilÃ ! Bon appÃ©tit.

119
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,930
I missed you, baby sweet.

120
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,020
Honey, it's beautiful.

121
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,730
Just put your feet up.

122
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,430
Relax.

123
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,530
Was a day?

124
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,130
It was a day.

125
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,840
Would you read to me?

126
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,170
It'll make you feel better.

127
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,090
- You hate that book.
- I don't wanna read either.

128
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,980
Let's dance.

129
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,640
Do you wanna dance,
or do you wanna open your present?

130
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,400
What present?

131
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,780
- This one.
- What's the occasion?

132
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,690
Let's just say...

133
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,240
- ...it's our anniversary.
- Is it?

134
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,160
No, but let's just say that it is.

135
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,170
Okay?

136
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,250
Happy anniversary.

137
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,340
An emanator.

138
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,680
Thank you.

139
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,260
Honey, you can go anywhere you want
in the world now.

140
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,300
Where do you wanna go first?

141
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,480
I'm so happy when I'm with you.

142
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,120
You don't have to say that.

143
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,530
The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.

144
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,030
Get down here.

145
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,370
Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.

146
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,610
Your box is a military footlocker,
issued to Sapper Morton...

147
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:17,480
...creatively repurposed as an ossuary:
a box of bones.

148
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,900
Nothing else in it but hair.

149
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:25,080
The soil samples indicate
that she's been buried for 30 years.

150
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,880
Bones all dismantled, fully cleaned,
meticulously laid to rest.

151
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,700
"She"?

152
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,970
Cause of death, Coco?

153
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,320
No breaks, no sign of trauma, except...

154
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,570
...a fracture through the ilium.

155
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,810
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

156
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,060
She was pregnant?

157
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,700
So he didn't kill her?

158
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,190
She died in childbirth.

159
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,080
What's that?

160
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,780
Go back.

161
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,080
Closer.

162
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,050
Closer.

163
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,250
What's that?

164
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,230
Notching in the iliac crest.

165
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,770
It's fine-point, like a scalpel.

166
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,640
That looks like an emergency C-section.

167
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,480
The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.

168
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,700
He was a combat medic. Maybe he tried
to save her, and he just couldn't.

169
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,240
He didn't seem like the saving type.

170
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,500
He went to the trouble of burying her.

171
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,170
A sentimental skin-job.

172
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,300
Sorry.

173
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,920
So where's the kid?

174
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,760
You scan the whole field?

175
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,290
Just dirt and worms. No other bodies.

176
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,430
Maybe he ate it.

177
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,980
That's not possible.

178
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,690
She was a Replicant.

179
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,560
Pregnant.

180
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,620
The world is built on a wall.

181
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,170
It separates kind.

182
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,760
Tell either side there's no wall,
you bought a war.

183
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,790
Or a slaughter.

184
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,590
So what you saw...

185
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,600
...didn't happen.

186
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,360
Yes, madam.

187
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,360
It is my job to keep order.

188
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,640
That's what we do here. We keep order.

189
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,310
You want it gone?

190
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,980
Erase everything.

191
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,080
- Even the child?
- All trace.

192
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,580
You have anything more to say?

193
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,250
I've never retired something
that was born before.

194
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
What's the difference?

195
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,270
To be born is to have a soul, I guess.

196
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,760
Are you telling me no?

197
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,350
I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.

198
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,570
Attaboy.

199
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,370
Hey. You've been getting on fine
without one.

200
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,580
What's that, madam?

201
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,230
A soul.

202
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,590
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...

203
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,130
...because you've never seen a miracle.

204
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,610
Just checking in on an old serial number.

205
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,700
Confirmation DNA?

206
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,800
I got hair.

207
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,430
An old one.

208
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,820
Pre-Blackout.

209
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,360
That's gonna be tough.

210
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,700
Not much from then.

211
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,980
And what's there is...

212
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,190
...thick milky.

213
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,790
You can customize them
as much as you'd like.

214
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,700
As human as you want them to be.

215
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,450
But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

216
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,300
I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence, attachment or appeal.

217
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,350
Unless you'd like to add
some pleasure models to your order.

218
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,940
Would it be possible
to reschedule this call, please?

219
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,790
Everyone remembers where they were
at the Blackout. You?

220
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,540
That was a little before my time.

221
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,790
I was home with my folks,
then 10 days of darkness.

222
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,500
Every machine stopped cold.

223
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,880
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

224
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,670
Photos, files, every bit of data, gone.
Bank records too.

225
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,000
Didn't mind that.

226
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,220
It's funny it's only paper that lasted.

227
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,850
I mean, we had everything on drives.
Everything, everything, everything.

228
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,020
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

229
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:49,480
Well, it's a shame.
You must have been adorable.

230
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,530
Pretty fractured. Not much on it.

231
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,570
One of the last gens, pre-Prohibition.

232
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,610
Standard issue.

233
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,380
- Made by Tyrell.
- And?

234
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,200
Unremarkable.

235
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,630
"Unremarkable"?

236
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,630
There must be something else
we can find for him.

237
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,900
Another prodigal serial number returns.

238
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,360
A 30-year-old open case finally closed.

239
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,770
Thank you, officer.

240
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,480
I'm here for Mr. Wallace. I'm Luv.

241
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,740
He named you.

242
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,410
Must be special.

243
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,620
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

244
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,360
Follow me.

245
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,130
The ancient models give
the entire endeavor a bad name.

246
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,220
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

247
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,430
The outer colonies would never have
flourished had he not bought Tyrell...

248
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,190
...revivified the technology.

249
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,020
To say the least of what we do.

250
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,120
I see you're also a customer.

251
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,820
Are you satisfied with our product?

252
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,130
She's very realistic. Thank you.

253
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,160
Here. All the junk is in here.

254
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,510
Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

255
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,070
No one's been down here in ages.

256
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,780
Sorry about that.

257
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,630
All our memory bearings from the time.
They were all damaged in the Blackout.

258
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,790
But there are sometimes fragments.

259
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,360
You got a little boy. He shows you his
butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.

260
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,560
I'd take him to the doctor.

261
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,580
- There's a wasp crawling on your arm.
- I'd kill it.

262
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,410
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

263
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,710
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

264
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,120
Just answer the questions, please.

265
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,220
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

266
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,300
This was a test.

267
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,980
We were difficult to spot then.

268
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:11,590
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

269
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,610
To warrant an official investigation?

270
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,100
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

271
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:24,520
Everyone just sleeps better
when they know where they got to.

272
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,740
She likes him.

273
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,210
Who?

274
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,170
This Officer Deckard.

275
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,290
She's trying to provoke him.

276
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,000
It is invigorating
being asked personal questions.

277
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,050
Makes one feel...

278
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,840
...desired.

279
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,350
Do you enjoy your work, officer?

280
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,530
Please thank Mr. Wallace for your time.

281
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,570
You worked with Officer Deckard...

282
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,500
...back in the day.

283
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,450
What can you tell me about him?

284
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,510
He liked to work alone.

285
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,260
So did I.

286
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,720
So we worked together
to keep it that way.

287
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,640
That was it.

288
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,550
Anything else you can tell me?

289
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,970
He wasn't long for this world.

290
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,560
How so?

291
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,070
Something in his eyes.

292
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,040
Any idea how I could contact him?

293
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,250
None.

294
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,170
He's nyugdÃ­jas.

295
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,120
Retired.

296
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,300
What happened?

297
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,250
Probably got what he wanted.

298
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,600
To be alone.

299
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,070
Welcome back, sir.

300
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,750
You wanted to review the new model,
sir, before shipment?

301
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,670
An angel should never enter
the kingdom of heaven...

302
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,340
...without a gift.

303
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,720
Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

304
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,240
A new model.

305
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,410
Well, let us see her, then.

306
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,170
The first thought...

307
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,130
...one tends to fear...

308
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,090
...to preserve the clay.

309
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,890
It's fascinating.

310
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,680
Before we even know what we are...

311
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,650
...we fear to lose it.

312
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,120
Happy birthday.

313
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,040
Now, let's have a look at you.

314
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,090
We make angels...

315
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,560
...in the service of civilization.

316
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,220
Yes, there were bad angels once.

317
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,860
I make good angels now.

318
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:56,020
That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.

319
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,120
Nine.

320
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,490
A child can count to nine on fingers.

321
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,630
We should own the stars.

322
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,210
Yes, sir.

323
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,960
Every leap of civilization was built off
the back of a disposable workforce.

324
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,340
We lost our stomach for slaves...

325
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,920
...unless engineered.

326
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,470
But I can only make so many.

327
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,910
That barren pasture...

328
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,910
...empty...

329
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,900
...and salted...

330
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,990
...right here.

331
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,840
The dead space between the stars.

332
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,290
And this, the seat
that we must change for heaven.

333
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,050
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

334
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,760
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

335
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,970
Millions, so we can be trillions more.

336
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,860
We could storm Eden and retake her.

337
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,590
Tyrell's final trick:

338
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,710
Procreation.

339
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,130
Perfected, then lost.

340
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,050
But there is a child.

341
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,140
Bring it to me.

342
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,060
Sir.

343
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,740
The best angel of all.

344
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,780
Aren't you, Luv?

345
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,110
The man with the green jacket.

346
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,150
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

347
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,640
Hi.

348
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,920
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

349
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,920
You alone?

350
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,520
It's fine.

351
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,770
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

352
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,460
Oh, you don't even smile.

353
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,830
Didn't you hear your friends?

354
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,840
Don't you know what I am?

355
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,750
Yeah.

356
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,040
Guy eating rice.

357
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,720
What's that?

358
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:30,670
It's a tree.

359
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,060
Never seen a tree before.

360
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,940
It's pretty.

361
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,610
It's dead.

362
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:47,860
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

363
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,610
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

364
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,420
Depends. What's your model number?

365
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,090
Why don't you look under my eye
and find out?

366
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,680
You don't like real girls.

367
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:15,630
Well, I'm always here.

368
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,980
Hi.

369
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,400
You can't take those.

370
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:02,690
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

371
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,580
Hold this for me.

372
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,320
Yep. Here you go.

373
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,340
Coco is dead.

374
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,610
Bones are gone.

375
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:34,940
It's out. Already out.
How long did that take?

376
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,320
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

377
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,910
I found that.

378
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,190
A sock?

379
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,120
- Where'd you find it?
- Sapper's.

380
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:49,380
Anything else?

381
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,790
I burned everything else.

382
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,210
Then what's this? What's that date?
Is that a birthday? A death day?

383
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,050
I don't know yet.

384
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:03,250
Am I the only one that can see
the fucking sunrise here?

385
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,520
This breaks the world, K.

386
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,490
You know, I've known a lot of your kind.

387
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:28,330
All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.

388
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,820
We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.

389
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:39,000
Do you remember anything?

390
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,880
Before you were under me,
you have any memories from before?

391
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,260
I have memories...

392
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,760
...but they're not real.
They're just implants.

393
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,350
Tell me one.

394
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,780
From when you were a kid.

395
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:04,120
I feel strange sharing a childhood story,
considering I was never a child.

396
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,740
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

397
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,620
I have one about a toy that I had.

398
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:17,870
A wooden horse.

399
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,430
With an inscription underneath.

400
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,050
All I remember is a group of boys
trying to take it away from me.

401
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:29,390
So I run.

402
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,710
I go looking for a place to hide it,
and the only place is this dark furnace.

403
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,380
It's very dark, and I'm very scared...

404
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:08,140
...but this horse is all I have,
so I go in anyway.

405
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,600
Later on, those kids find me...

406
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,440
...and they beat me to tell them
where it is, but I don't.

407
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,830
That's it.

408
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,370
Little K, fighting for what's his.

409
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,290
It's a good one.

410
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:49,510
Look at me.

411
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:55,590
We're all just looking out
for something real.

412
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,990
What happens if I finish that?

413
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,110
Shouldn't I get back to work, madam?

414
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,880
Check back in after DNAbase.

415
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:36,440
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

416
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,650
Request.

417
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:44,810
DNA records: children born 6-10-21.

418
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,020
Looking for anomalies.

419
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:55,990
You have the satcrystal backup?

420
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:03,370
Okay.

421
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,790
Run it raw.

422
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,630
Mere data makes a man.

423
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,160
A and C and T and G.

424
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,210
The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.

425
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,880
I'm only two:

426
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:01,140
One and zero.

427
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,820
Half as much but twice as elegant,
sweetheart.

428
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,190
You don't prefer your madam?

429
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,490
You were listening.

430
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,820
Maybe.

431
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,750
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

432
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:22,580
Six, 10 and 21.

433
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,200
There's nothing to tell.

434
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,210
How many times
have you told me that story?

435
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,970
Your memory?

436
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:38,420
The date carved beneath.

437
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,760
Six, 10 and 21.

438
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,440
Coincidence?

439
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,240
A dangerous coincidence.

440
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:57,940
I always knew you were special.

441
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,780
Maybe this is how.

442
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,120
A child.

443
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:10,750
Of woman born.

444
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,220
Pushed into the world.

445
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,140
Wanted.

446
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,100
Loved.

447
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:24,760
Well, if it were true...

448
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:30,030
...I'd be hunted for the rest of my life
by someone just like me.

449
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,070
It's okay to dream a little.

450
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,570
- Isn't it?
- Not if you're us.

451
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,040
Stop.

452
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:50,080
Put up 4847 and 2181 side-by-side.

453
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:57,850
They're identical. Translate.

454
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,730
A boy and a girl.

455
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,550
- It's impossible.
- Why?

456
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,430
Two people can't have identical DNA.

457
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,450
One of these isn't real. It's a copy.

458
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:25,330
They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

459
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,710
It says the girl died there.

460
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:32,000
Genetic disorder.

461
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,210
Galatians Syndrome.

462
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,220
And the boy...

463
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,920
...disappears.

464
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,670
Where's the orphanage?

465
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,270
You wanna go for a ride?

466
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,800
Well, here we are.

467
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,600
Buckle up.

468
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,120
K?

469
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:17,730
K? K?

470
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:21,140
K? K? K?

471
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:14,190
Stay back.

472
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,130
Fire again.

473
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,260
Fire again.

474
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:35,630
Fire.

475
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:49,730
Two hundred feet to the east.

476
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,610
Fire.

477
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,030
Go north.

478
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,820
Fire.

479
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,920
Stop. Twenty degrees east.

480
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:06,830
Stop.

481
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,790
Zoom in.

482
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,750
Closer.

483
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,100
Oh, come on.

484
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,800
Get up.

485
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,300
Do your fucking job.

486
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:24,860
Find the child.

487
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,310
Watch the car.

488
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:45,000
Every last piece, or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining...

489
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,210
...where it's raining fire!

490
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,080
You're in here to work.

491
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:52,510
And if you're not working,
I don't need you.

492
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:55,090
I don't need any of...

493
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:58,720
Hi.

494
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:08,100
The nickel is for the colonial ships.

495
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:11,070
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get...

496
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:14,490
...to that grand life Off-world.

497
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:18,600
And I encourage play, I do.
Keeps them occupied...

498
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,410
...and it makes them nimble, right?

499
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,830
But it's work.

500
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,780
It's work that molds them
into a child worth having.

501
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,170
So come on, now.

502
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,640
What sort do you have in mind?

503
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:48,390
Because I got all kinds.

504
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,110
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'm not buying.

505
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:55,360
No, no, no. This is just my game,
and I play it fair.

506
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,400
No. No, I mean, bigger than you...

507
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:05,500
Bigger than you have tried
to shut me down. Bigger than you.

508
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:08,540
And they were men, at that.

509
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,710
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

510
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:16,050
I need to see your records.

511
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,300
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

512
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,760
Don't keep records that far back.

513
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,920
- You don't?
- I don't.

514
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:27,560
Sorry.

515
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,550
Can't help you.

516
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:34,180
- You can't?
- Nope.

517
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,230
I think you can.

518
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:45,110
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

519
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:48,080
Now you can tell me
what you remember...

520
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,530
...or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.

521
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,880
They were laughing and what was it
you said? What'd you say?

522
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,780
Are you coming?

523
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,300
Where is it?

524
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:44,920
Oh, God.

525
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,440
Where, where, where?

526
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:56,850
I don't see it. Here.

527
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:06,620
It's gone.

528
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,860
It's the entire year.

529
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,160
I didn't do that.

530
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:17,250
That wasn't me.

531
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:23,250
I didn't. Wasn't me.

532
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:59,240
I always told you.

533
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,200
You're special.

534
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:06,870
Born.

535
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:09,590
Not made.

536
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,220
Hidden with care.

537
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:20,560
A real boy now.

538
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,340
A real boy needs a real name.

539
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,190
Joe.

540
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,720
"Joe"?

541
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:34,230
You're too important for K.

542
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,990
Your mother would've named you.

543
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,120
Joe.

544
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,740
- Joe.
- Stop.

545
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,410
How do I know
if a memory is an implant or not?

546
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,140
Who makes the memories?

547
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:34,580
Dr. Ana Stelline?

548
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,830
A visitor.

549
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,710
Is that okay?

550
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:45,220
Yes.

551
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:49,520
It's just unusual.

552
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:54,900
Nice to meet you, Officer KD6 - 3.7.

553
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:03,560
Sorry.
It's a compromised immune system.

554
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:07,790
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

555
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,000
- Is that why you're not Off-world?
- Yes.

556
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:15,620
My parents had our passes in pocket,
but I took sick.

557
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,960
So it was a new life for me.

558
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:24,510
And they put me in my cage...

559
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:27,760
...filled it with everything they could
to keep me happy.

560
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:32,850
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

561
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:37,220
What can I help you with?

562
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:41,280
Thought you might be able to help me
with a case.

563
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:48,580
Oh, that's the most interesting thing
I've been offered to help with in ages.

564
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:52,540
Do you mind if I work while you talk?

565
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:55,070
Of course.

566
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,680
I promise I hear every word.

567
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:14,090
They say you're
the best memory-maker there is.

568
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:16,310
Well, then, they're kind.

569
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,970
I love birthday parties.

570
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:25,620
You work for Wallace?

571
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:29,290
Subcontract. I'm one of his suppliers.

572
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:33,580
He offered to buy me out,
but I take my freedom where I can find it.

573
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,450
Why are you so good?

574
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,550
What makes your memories
so authentic?

575
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:43,590
Well, there's a bit of every artist
in their work.

576
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:48,470
But I was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8...

577
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:53,720
...so if I wanted to see the world,
I had to imagine it.

578
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:58,360
Got very good at imagining.

579
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:02,230
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

580
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:06,650
I think it's only kind.

581
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:13,610
Replicants live such hard lives,
made to do what we'd rather not.

582
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:15,070
I can't help your future...

583
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:19,990
...but I can give you good memories
to think back on and smile.

584
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:21,210
It's nice.

585
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:24,970
It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.

586
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:30,850
And if you have authentic memories,
you have real human responses.

587
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,510
Wouldn't you agree?

588
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:45,390
Are they all constructed,
or do you ever use ones that are real?

589
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:52,540
It's illegal to use real memories, officer.

590
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:56,610
How can you tell the difference?

591
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:59,170
Can you tell if something...

592
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,630
...really happened?

593
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:06,720
They all think it's about more detail.

594
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:10,000
But that's not how memory works.

595
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:12,130
We recall with our feelings.

596
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:16,430
Anything real should be a mess.

597
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,720
I can show you.

598
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,520
Sit.

599
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:45,660
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

600
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,120
Not even that hard. Just picture it.

601
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:51,390
Let it play.

602
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:43,800
Someone lived this, yes.

603
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:47,150
This happened.

604
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:05,530
I know it's real.

605
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,680
I know it's real.

606
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:25,270
Goddamn it!

607
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:13,570
Officer KD6 - 3.7.
Madam is calling you in.

608
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:14,770
You're under arrest.

609
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:18,020
Drop your gun and keep your hands
where I can see them.

610
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:19,830
- Cells.
- Cells.

611
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:22,370
Have you ever been
in an institution? Cells.

612
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:26,910
When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

613
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,290
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

614
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:31,050
What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love?

615
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:34,010
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

616
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:36,550
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within the cells interlinked.

617
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:40,630
What's it like
to be filled with dread? Dreadfully.

618
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,630
Do you like being separated
from other people? Distinct.

619
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,800
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.

620
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:49,290
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within the cells interlinked.

621
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:51,930
- Within one stem.
- Within one stem.

622
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:54,430
- And dreadfully distinct.
- And dreadfully distinct.

623
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:56,320
- Against the dark.
- Against the dark.

624
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:00,650
- A tall white fountain played.
- A tall white fountain played.

625
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:06,290
You're not even close to baseline.

626
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:14,040
Out! And close the door.

627
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:16,760
What the fuck is with you?

628
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,970
I put you on a case.

629
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:21,380
I impressed on you
the importance of that case...

630
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:25,390
...and then we pick you up fucking
around outside an upgrade center?

631
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:31,270
Scan said you didn't look like you
on the inside. Miles off your baseline.

632
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:34,430
- Do you know what that means?
- I found the kid.

633
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:42,190
He was set up like a standard Replicant,
put on a service job.

634
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,740
Even he didn't know who he was.

635
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:51,030
- And?
- And it's done.

636
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,540
- What does that mean, "it's done"?
- What you asked.

637
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:57,580
It's done.

638
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:02,840
Fuck.

639
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:06,920
You just stopped a bomb from going off.

640
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:10,760
You did good.

641
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:15,060
I can help you get out
of this station alive...

642
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:17,320
...but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

643
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:19,950
Surrender your gun and badge.

644
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:23,530
And your next baseline test
is out of my hands.

645
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,660
Thank you, madam.

646
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:00,560
You were right.

647
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,080
You were right about everything.

648
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:41,980
Thought you weren't interested,
worky man.

649
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,620
You liked her. I could tell.

650
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,200
It's okay.

651
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:53,410
She's real.

652
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:58,000
I wanna be real for you.

653
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:00,550
You are real for me.

654
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:03,250
You have a special lady here.

655
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,020
Okay.

656
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,490
Let's do it.

657
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:48,760
Look at you.

658
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:51,420
Quiet now, I have to sync.

659
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:51,400
Joi is anything you want her to be.

660
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:56,370
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

661
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:29,680
99.9 percent detoxified water.

662
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:00,670
It's from a tree.

663
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,670
I'm done with you.

664
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:05,060
You can go now.

665
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,360
Quiet now.

666
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:20,240
I've been inside you.

667
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:23,480
Not so much there as you think.

668
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:43,630
Coffee?

669
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:52,100
They'll be coming after me soon.

670
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:02,730
I'm coming with you.

671
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:04,370
But not like this.

672
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:10,490
If they come here looking for you,
they'll have access to all my memories.

673
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:13,580
You have to delete me
from the console.

674
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:16,120
My present.

675
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,630
Put me there.

676
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:23,550
I can't do that.

677
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,520
Think about it:

678
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:29,380
If anything happens to this, that's it.

679
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:31,980
You're gone.

680
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,140
Yes.

681
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:37,490
Like a real girl.

682
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,610
Please.

683
01:33:47,490 --> 01:33:48,860
Joe, please.

684
01:33:50,370 --> 01:33:51,870
I want this.

685
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:58,500
But I can't do it myself.

686
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:17,140
Break the antenna.

687
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:58,890
I don't need a real horse.

688
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:07,490
I don't need a real horse.
I just wanna find out where it's from.

689
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:19,090
Radiation from a reactor?

690
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,300
It matches a dirty bomb.

691
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:39,480
There's only one place that dirty.

692
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:42,900
Nobody lives there.

693
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:35,320
Go to five.

694
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:38,710
Four, 30 degrees to the left.

695
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:42,160
Tilt up.

696
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:46,970
Elevate to 400 feet.

697
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:54,600
Radiation analysis.

698
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:59,100
Move forward.

699
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:07,350
Tilt up.

700
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,020
Stop.

701
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:12,660
Move forward.

702
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,120
Go to five.

703
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:17,790
Seven, move forward.

704
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:24,740
Six.

705
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:27,470
Stop.

706
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,670
Go to seven.

707
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:33,670
Eight.

708
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:36,130
Nine.

709
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,720
Heat analysis.

710
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,820
Life.

711
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,070
What is it?

712
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:55,870
Guess we're about to find out.

713
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,590
Too dark in here.

714
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:12,340
I like him.

715
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:14,890
He's a good boy.

716
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,630
Where is he?

717
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:27,230
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

718
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:29,310
Check around.

719
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,230
I checked...

720
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:34,480
...anywhere a good boy might go.

721
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:36,830
You're too late.

722
01:38:39,570 --> 01:38:41,360
It's gone.

723
01:38:44,290 --> 01:38:46,170
He destroyed it.

724
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:50,750
Everything about it.

725
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:54,140
Well, except for the box of bones
that you already took.

726
01:38:58,390 --> 01:39:02,440
Which, I'll wager, wasn't enough.
Here you are.

727
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:12,110
You tiny thing.

728
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:17,240
In the face of the fabulous new,
your only thought is to kill it?

729
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:21,120
For fear of great change?

730
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:24,950
You can't hold the tide with a broom.

731
01:39:25,330 --> 01:39:27,210
Except that I did.

732
01:39:28,370 --> 01:39:29,870
Where is he?!

733
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:35,720
You're so sure.

734
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,130
Because he told you.

735
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,630
Because we never lie.

736
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:46,440
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

737
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:49,560
So I had to kill you.

738
01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:55,320
Then do what you gotta do.

739
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:58,120
Madam.

740
01:40:30,230 --> 01:40:33,360
Location: Officer KD6 - 3.7.

741
01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:26,990
Mightn't happen to have
a piece of cheese about you, now?

742
01:45:27,570 --> 01:45:29,490
Would you, boy?

743
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:45,410
Treasure Island?

744
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:54,390
He reads.

745
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:56,980
That's good.

746
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,470
Me too.

747
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:03,940
Not much else to do around here
at night anymore.

748
01:46:06,270 --> 01:46:11,270
Many is the night I dream of cheese...

749
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:18,080
...toasted, mostly.

750
01:46:20,910 --> 01:46:23,030
What are you doing here?

751
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:27,000
I heard the piano.

752
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:31,090
Don't lie.

753
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:33,420
It's rude.

754
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,560
You're a cop.

755
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:41,020
- I'm not here to take you in.
- Oh, yeah?

756
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:45,360
Then, what?

757
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:49,900
I just have some questions.

758
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:52,030
What questions?

759
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:11,420
Stay.

760
01:49:44,990 --> 01:49:47,620
Look, I don't wanna hurt you.

761
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:49,860
But you're not making it easy.

762
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:41,250
I like this song.

763
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:55,220
We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

764
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:09,290
I'll take the drink.

765
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:19,380
This is really something.

766
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:21,660
The whole town was something.

767
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,680
One time.

768
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:27,470
Forget your troubles...

769
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:30,520
...see a show...

770
01:51:31,930 --> 01:51:34,060
...gamble a little.

771
01:51:36,350 --> 01:51:39,140
Win some money, lose some money.

772
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:43,310
They made money seem like candy.

773
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:45,400
You like whiskey?

774
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:47,780
I've got millions...

775
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:50,370
...of bottles of whiskey.

776
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:05,090
Here.

777
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:08,100
Bleeding.

778
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:21,640
Is it real?

779
01:52:22,770 --> 01:52:24,270
I don't know.

780
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:26,230
Ask him.

781
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:43,620
You got a name?

782
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,500
Officer KD6 - 3.7...

783
01:52:47,670 --> 01:52:50,460
That's not a name.
That's a serial number.

784
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:54,930
All right.

785
01:52:57,350 --> 01:52:58,810
Joe.

786
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:01,190
What do you want, Joe?

787
01:53:02,230 --> 01:53:05,360
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?

788
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:15,910
Like what was her name,
the mother of your child?

789
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:24,080
What was she like?

790
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:39,050
- You two live here together?
- Too many questions.

791
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,300
I had your job. I was good at it.

792
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:44,440
- It was simpler then.
- Why you making it complicated?

793
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,930
- Why don't you answer the question?
- What question?

794
01:53:47,110 --> 01:53:50,110
I didn't figure you as one for bullshit.

795
01:53:50,650 --> 01:53:52,070
What's her name?

796
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:07,260
Rachael.

797
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:14,140
Her name was Rachael.

798
01:54:18,010 --> 01:54:19,630
What happened to the kid?

799
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:25,810
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

800
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,900
I was long gone by then.

801
01:54:34,030 --> 01:54:36,490
You didn't even meet your own kid?

802
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:40,460
Why?

803
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:42,920
Because that was the plan.

804
01:54:45,710 --> 01:54:50,340
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

805
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:53,850
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

806
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:57,510
Then the Blackout came,
paved over everything.

807
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:00,100
Couldn't have found the child if I tried.

808
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:02,800
- Did you want to?
- Not really.

809
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:07,530
- Why not?
- Because we were being hunted.

810
01:55:07,690 --> 01:55:10,030
I didn't want our child found...

811
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:14,060
...taken apart, dissected.

812
01:55:17,570 --> 01:55:20,780
Sometimes, to love someone...

813
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:24,830
...you gotta be a stranger.

814
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,470
To strangers.

815
01:57:59,110 --> 01:58:00,740
What'd you do?

816
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,520
Who'd you bring?

817
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:07,110
- No one.
- Oh, yeah?

818
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:13,740
Target locked.

819
01:58:16,290 --> 01:58:17,410
They know you're here.

820
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:21,380
I came alone.

821
02:00:28,050 --> 02:00:29,140
Bad dog.

822
02:00:47,030 --> 02:00:48,450
Stop.

823
02:01:04,460 --> 02:01:06,620
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

824
02:01:07,710 --> 02:01:09,420
I love...

825
02:04:22,990 --> 02:04:27,620
Hey, there's someone
who wants to meet you.

826
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:30,300
You can trust us.

827
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:41,640
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

828
02:04:47,390 --> 02:04:48,600
This is Freysa.

829
02:04:49,730 --> 02:04:51,860
She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

830
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:53,940
I recognize you.

831
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:57,860
Did you help him hide the child?

832
02:05:00,070 --> 02:05:02,030
I was there.

833
02:05:05,450 --> 02:05:07,990
I saw a miracle delivered.

834
02:05:08,870 --> 02:05:12,410
A perfect little face crying up at me.

835
02:05:12,790 --> 02:05:15,160
Mad as thunder.

836
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:29,940
Were you with her?

837
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:33,020
Rachael?

838
02:05:33,190 --> 02:05:35,820
I held her as she died.

839
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:41,450
We hid the child
and made a vow to keep our secret.

840
02:05:41,610 --> 02:05:44,400
That's why Sapper let you kill him.

841
02:05:45,370 --> 02:05:52,090
I knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves.

842
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:55,250
If a baby can come from one of us...

843
02:05:55,420 --> 02:05:58,590
...we are our own masters.

844
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:01,430
More human than humans.

845
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:05,050
A revolution is coming.

846
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:08,140
And we're building an army.

847
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:11,020
I want to free our people.

848
02:06:19,530 --> 02:06:21,200
If you want to be free...

849
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:23,650
...join us.

850
02:06:28,580 --> 02:06:31,380
Deckard, Sapper, you, me...

851
02:06:31,540 --> 02:06:35,510
...our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

852
02:06:36,290 --> 02:06:40,960
Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.

853
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:46,090
You led Wallace to Deckard.

854
02:06:46,470 --> 02:06:50,810
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

855
02:06:50,970 --> 02:06:52,850
You must kill Deckard.

856
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:05,790
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

857
02:07:05,950 --> 02:07:07,000
And she is.

858
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:13,080
When the time comes,
I will show her to the world...

859
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:15,380
...and she will lead our army.

860
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:16,950
"She"?

861
02:07:17,130 --> 02:07:19,010
Of course.

862
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:21,510
Rachael had a daughter.

863
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:25,890
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

864
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:29,220
I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.

865
02:07:29,390 --> 02:07:31,480
It was a boy that you hid.

866
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:37,180
That is just a piece of the puzzle.

867
02:07:53,620 --> 02:07:56,630
You imagined it was you?

868
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:00,970
You did.

869
02:08:01,460 --> 02:08:03,040
You did.

870
02:08:05,670 --> 02:08:08,380
We all wish it was us.

871
02:08:09,470 --> 02:08:11,930
That's why we believe.

872
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:29,780
Someone lived this, yes.

873
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:36,820
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

874
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,380
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

875
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:45,180
I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.

876
02:08:45,550 --> 02:08:47,890
There's a bit of every
artist in their work.

877
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:29,050
Always jumping, that one.

878
02:09:29,630 --> 02:09:32,800
Never a thought of what to do
if it made land.

879
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:38,930
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

880
02:09:43,190 --> 02:09:47,910
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

881
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:09,840
You are a wonder to me, Mr. Deckard.

882
02:10:15,350 --> 02:10:16,930
I had the lock.

883
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:21,100
I found the key.

884
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:27,490
Yet the pins do not align.
The door remains locked.

885
02:10:29,530 --> 02:10:33,580
I need the specimen to reach it,
Mr. Deckard.

886
02:10:36,700 --> 02:10:38,410
The child.

887
02:10:39,580 --> 02:10:41,080
I need the child.

888
02:10:42,660 --> 02:10:45,160
To teach them all to fly.

889
02:10:53,590 --> 02:10:57,880
And God remembered Rachel...

890
02:10:59,470 --> 02:11:03,100
...heeded her and opened her womb.

891
02:11:04,690 --> 02:11:06,730
Do you like our owl?

892
02:11:09,190 --> 02:11:10,900
It's artificial?

893
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:14,020
Of course it is.

894
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:17,200
Must be expensive.

895
02:11:18,780 --> 02:11:21,450
Very. I'm Rachael.

896
02:11:22,450 --> 02:11:24,080
Deckard.

897
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:38,020
Is it the same...

898
02:11:39,010 --> 02:11:41,970
...now, as then...

899
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:46,390
...the moment you met her?

900
02:11:56,070 --> 02:11:59,070
All these years
you looked back on that day...

901
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:03,110
...drunk on the memory
of its perfection.

902
02:12:05,790 --> 02:12:07,960
How shiny her lips.

903
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:11,160
How instant your connection.

904
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:18,960
Did it never occur to you that's why
you were summoned in the first place?

905
02:12:20,350 --> 02:12:26,400
Designed to do nothing short
of fall for her right then and there.

906
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:33,980
All to make that single perfect specimen.

907
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:40,200
That is, if you were designed.

908
02:12:41,070 --> 02:12:42,650
Love...

909
02:12:42,830 --> 02:12:45,790
...or mathematical precision.

910
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:52,830
Yes.

911
02:12:53,590 --> 02:12:55,260
No.

912
02:12:59,550 --> 02:13:01,880
I know what's real.

913
02:13:25,580 --> 02:13:28,920
It was very clever
to keep yourself empty of information...

914
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:33,250
...and all it cost you was everything.

915
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:38,590
But you can still help me.

916
02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:44,180
You had help in the hiding.

917
02:13:46,010 --> 02:13:48,300
Where did they go?

918
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:51,510
I know you know something.

919
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:54,560
Help me...

920
02:13:55,190 --> 02:13:59,240
...and very, very good things
can come to you.

921
02:14:04,410 --> 02:14:06,750
You don't have children...

922
02:14:09,870 --> 02:14:10,990
...do you?

923
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:14,800
Oh, I have millions.

924
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:19,830
You think I have nothing to offer but pain.

925
02:14:20,010 --> 02:14:22,350
Only I know...

926
02:14:23,090 --> 02:14:24,920
...you love pain.

927
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:31,060
Pain reminds you
the joy you felt was real.

928
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:34,680
More joy, then.

929
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:42,870
Do not be afraid.

930
02:14:57,630 --> 02:14:59,180
An angel...

931
02:15:00,340 --> 02:15:01,470
...made again.

932
02:15:05,970 --> 02:15:07,640
For you.

933
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:43,670
Did you miss me?

934
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:03,400
Don't you love me?

935
02:16:22,130 --> 02:16:23,510
Her eyes were green.

936
02:16:41,400 --> 02:16:43,660
Off-world...

937
02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:47,580
...I have everything I need
to make you talk.

938
02:16:48,950 --> 02:16:52,120
You do not know what pain is yet.

939
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:55,110
You will learn.

940
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:08,960
Hello, handsome.

941
02:17:25,730 --> 02:17:28,190
What a day.

942
02:17:32,030 --> 02:17:33,650
You look lonely.

943
02:17:34,950 --> 02:17:37,410
I can fix that.

944
02:17:40,330 --> 02:17:42,950
You look like a good joe.

945
02:18:18,450 --> 02:18:24,250
Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.

946
02:18:26,590 --> 02:18:29,550
Because you've never seen a miracle.

947
02:19:07,710 --> 02:19:10,880
You're entering Los Angeles Airport
restricted airspace.

948
02:19:11,050 --> 02:19:13,350
Confirm your identity.

949
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:16,390
Transport S-14-4-XD. Confirmed.

950
02:19:16,550 --> 02:19:18,260
Space, this is 0-6.

951
02:19:18,430 --> 02:19:21,150
Outbound departure, route 0-3-0.

952
02:19:21,310 --> 02:19:23,230
Where are we going?

953
02:19:23,980 --> 02:19:25,610
Home.

954
02:20:20,530 --> 02:20:22,280
Drive two down.

955
02:20:22,450 --> 02:20:24,530
Backup engaged.

956
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:26,540
Warning.

957
02:20:26,710 --> 02:20:29,510
- Can we make it?
- We're too low!

958
02:20:29,670 --> 02:20:30,800
Take us back!

959
02:21:19,970 --> 02:21:21,020
Get us up.

960
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:47,410
Open the door.

961
02:23:40,610 --> 02:23:42,700
I'm the best one.

962
02:24:23,190 --> 02:24:25,320
Off-world is waiting.

963
02:26:38,410 --> 02:26:41,450
Joe. Joe!

964
02:26:51,090 --> 02:26:52,800
Joe!

965
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:33,970
You should have let me die out there.

966
02:27:34,970 --> 02:27:36,600
You did.

967
02:27:40,270 --> 02:27:42,400
You drowned out there.

968
02:27:47,770 --> 02:27:49,560
You're free to meet your daughter now.

969
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:18,070
All the best memories are hers.

970
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,420
Why?

971
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:32,880
Who am I to you?

972
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:44,140
Go meet your daughter.

973
02:29:50,060 --> 02:29:51,520
You okay?

974
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:29,630
Just a moment.

975
02:32:31,890 --> 02:32:33,270
Beautiful, isn't it?
