1
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,714
You are entering a realm between

2
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,824
clandestine and forgotten,

3
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,577
a slipstream
caught between channels,

4
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,580
the secret museum of mankind,

5
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,332
the private library of shadows...

6
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,461
All taking place on a stage
forged from mystery

7
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:31,216
and found only on a frequency
caught between logic and myth.

8
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,886
You are entering
Paradox Theater.

9
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,436
Tonight’s episode,
"The Vast of Night."

10
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,747
You and the family headed to the game?

11
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,751
No, just me.
Patricia’s with the kids over in Hobbs.

12
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,004
Hobbs, huh?
Good thing we’re not playing them.

13
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,881
Boy, ain’t that right.

14
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,965
See you at the game.

15
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,705
I don’t want to light my next cigarette,
Benny. I got one here that’ll do the trick.

16
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,648
Mrs. McBroom’s looking for you.
Why?

17
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,608
I’m not sure why.
I was at supper.

18
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,544
Ingrid’s sister was giving you
the top to bottom.

19
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,328
No, she wasn’t.
Oh, yes, she was. In her car.

20
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,281
With Millie when
I was walking up.

21
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,368
Great damn dogs, what was that?
That’s why they were calling.

22
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,496
Make me feel better, Benny.
Make me feel better.
This is not good.

23
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,749
Arlo’s under the stands
figuring it out. Last time
it happened, it was a squirrel

24
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,253
that had bitten through a wire,
but the wire was still
in the mouth of the skeleton.

25
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,214
So is this the lights
or the electric? We can’t roll
if it’s flickering.

26
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,634
I don’t know. I was at supper.
How many times you gonna
tell me you were at supper?

27
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,929
Now... Sam, what’s barn
buzzard’s buzz, man?

28
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,765
I don’t know.
It’s just blinking in there.
Let’s plug it in.

29
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,743
I haven’t had
anything to test it.
Let’s figure it out.

30
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,102
Come on, plug it in.
Okay.

31
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,272
Be careful.
If it electrocutes you,

32
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,566
you’ll stop growing hair
and never get a date.

33
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,068
Oh, tune out, man.
Go find Mrs. McBroom.

34
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,989
I will, but I don’t like
that tone, Sam. If it’s blinking
when you start recording,

35
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,968
stop recording, or I’ll have
one of them Buell brothers
come beat the water out of you.

36
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:23,078
Everett. Hey.
Mrs. McBroom is looking for you.

37
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,956
Renny, up in the stands
with his horn.
I know. Benny told me.

38
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,351
-So what does she want?
-I don’t know.
She’s just walking around,

39
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,628
asking everybody,
"Where’s Everett?
Have you seen Everett?

40
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,298
When’s Everett getting here?"
That tells me nothing, Renny.

41
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,569
Go sit down with your horn.
Matter of fact, give it to me.
There’s something wrong with it.

42
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,052
I used to play trombone.
Everett!

43
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,531
Can I bring you
my tape recorder so you can
show me how it works?

44
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,492
I don’t know what you said, Fay.
You sound like a mouse
being eaten by a possum.

45
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,934
Renny, give me your horn.

46
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,495
Can I bring you
my tape recorder
so you can show me how it works?

47
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,646
Yeah, sure, Fay. Renny, now.
Great!

48
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,398
Why?
Drop it down now, Renny.

49
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,126
You can’t hurt it.
What am I gonna do, Renny?

50
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,195
What... Drop it down now.
Come on. Come on.

51
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,864
Yeah. There. Good boy.
Hey, where are you going?

52
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,575
Everett! Everett!
Bye, Renny. Bye, Renny.

53
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,287
Arlo told me to bring you down.
Why? Where is he?
What for? Down where?

54
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,208
He’s in the locker.
I don’t know what he wants.
They don’t tell me anything.

55
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,461
They don’t listen to me.
He just said,
"Go grab Everett."

56
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,064
I don’t know what’s going on.
I just got here.
I’m not gonna be able to help.

57
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,758
I got H.H. at 7:00, so...
I know that.

58
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,385
He just
doesn’t listen to me.

59
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,638
Come tell him for yourself.

60
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:27,518
I told them to turn the power
off during the tornado,
but they don’t listen to me.

61
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,188
Last time this happened,
it was a squirrel that
had bitten through the wire.

62
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,899
Squirrel still had
the wire in his mouth.
Yeah, Benny told me.

63
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,611
And we had a rat gnaw
through the scoreboard wire.
Did you know that?

64
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,571
No, I did not know that.
Uh-huh.

65
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,574
And an owl made his home
in the library attic,

66
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,661
so we had all these
critter bones
laying around the crawl space

67
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,790
where we keep the marching band uniforms. 
Helen Trank had a bat skull in her pocket.

68
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,673
- Hold it.
- Why are you here?

69
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,378
Whoa! No, no, wait.
I did that. I did that.

70
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:59,341
Arlo, get out now!
Hold it.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

71
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,387
What’s Everett doing here?
You told me
to bring him down here.

72
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,555
No, I didn’t.
Yes, you did.

73
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,265
I did not.
You told me.

74
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,059
I said bring Emmett down here,
not Everett.

75
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,520
Emmett. Emmett.
I asked you specifically

76
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,772
if you wanted
Everett from the radio.

77
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:17,317
Emmett doesn’t work
at the radio?
Everett works at the radio.

78
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,444
Arlo, if you don’t need me,
I’m gonna get back out.

79
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,447
Did Emmett never work
at the radio?
No, it’s just me.

80
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,158
Emmett works
at Santa Mira Mills.
He’s an electrician.

81
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:29,580
Now, hold on just a minute.
Emmett worked at the radio.

82
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,207
Wait, wait, wait.
You told me
to bring him down here.

83
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,627
Do you want us to record
over that last game?
And Renny wants his horn back.

84
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,714
I know he does.
That’s why I took it.
Did you get the reel? Because...

85
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,235
Every game use
the same reel. It’s in the back
of the recorder. I’ll show you.

86
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,470
Are you gonna give Renny
his horn back?
If he stops being bad news.

87
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,264
I mean, someone’s
got to spank his ass.

88
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,224
Oh, Fay, you meant right now?
Is that okay?

89
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,517
Uh, can you walk?
Yeah.

90
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,020
Just let me
look at this for them.

91
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,523
Found it. So we just use
the same reel as last time?
Same reel each game.

92
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,485
But that’s gonna cause
some cross talk eventually.
Right? I mean, won’t it?

93
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,072
Read the Bible, Sam?
Yes.

94
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,533
There’s your answer.
Answer to what?

95
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,744
Answer to everything.
But that doesn’t...

96
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,288
Yeah, eventually.
But no one’s gonna buy
a tape for every game.

97
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,184
If it’s a problem, I’ll ask
Mr. McKean. Maybe he’ll buy
you some new ones.

98
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,270
But it’s not gonna make
a difference now. If power
goes out, you stop recording.

99
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,339
I’m not buying
another one of those.
You said that.

100
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,759
-What’s the tale, nightingale?
-What’s all the fuss?
Why you got Renny’s horn?

101
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,196
Whoa, what’s this?
I didn’t know you’re in band.
Why aren’t you up there playing?

102
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,222
Oh, I can’t do pep band.
I work the games

103
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,557
so Ruth can watch them,
since Greg made varsity.

104
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,620
Why do you have Renny’s horn?
’Cause he needs to be punished
for being Renny.

105
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,104
Wait, you’re working?
What about, uh,
Rita Cope or Winifred?

106
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,358
Winifred works nights in
San Mirial. Rita Cope quit.
She works at Zeb’s now.

107
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,920
Okay, so clue me in
about this lunch box.
This is the Westinghouse?

108
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,172
Yeah, it’s the one
you told me to get.
Ah, where’d you get it?

109
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,157
Montgomery Ward catalog.
Play something.
What have you recorded?

110
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,827
Well, nothing yet.
I mean, I didn’t wanna
mess anything up.

111
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,705
You haven’t recorded anything?
No, I didn’t wanna
mess something up.

112
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,917
You have a brand-new
tape recorder. You haven’t been
curious to push a button?

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,503
I’ve been so curious.
I just didn’t want to...
I’m nervous.

114
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,046
Are there batteries in it?
Yes.

115
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,965
Then press record.
Pull out the mic.

116
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,675
On the side,
are the wheels spinning?

117
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,385
Yes.
All right, then talk.

118
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,053
What do I say?
Try this.

119
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,222
Raise your right hand.
Say, "I’m not now,

120
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,141
nor have I ever been, a member
of the Communist Party."

121
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:16,311
I’m not now, nor have
I ever been, a member
of the Communist Party.

122
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,189
Around Dodge City
and in the territory out west...

123
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,984
There’s only one way
to handle the spoilers
and the killers,

124
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,529
and that’s with a US marshal
and the smell of gun smoke.

125
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,841
Brought to you by L&amp;M filters.
That was good.
You want to hear it?

126
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,032
Yes.
All right, okay.

127
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,580
Hey, coyotes!

128
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:38,292
Yeah.

129
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,878
Those guys know me.
I’m Everett.
I like those guys.

130
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,424
This is Fay Crocker.
It’s not recording nothing.

131
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,594
I know. It’s just, I’ve never
held a microphone before.
I’m practicing.

132
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,364
I did not tell you to practice.
Told you to shut up.
I’m not shutting up.

133
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:55,142
It’s my recorder.
That was good. That’s how you
got to be when we’re recording.

134
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,395
That was queen of Cayuga.
You 500-Watt Fay.

135
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,022
This is Fay Crocker.

136
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:06,069
This is Fay Crocker.
I have never, up until now,
held a microphone.

137
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,406
One way to
handle the spoilers and the
killers, and that’s...

138
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,575
Isn’t that a charge?
It’s a large charge.

139
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,994
Press record.
Start going again.
Is that how I sound?

140
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,331
Yeah, that’s how you sound.
That’s 100% Cayuga queen.
Press record, roll tape.

141
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:21,084
What are we gonna record?
Cool it, Clyde. There’s plenty
to say. Follow me. Let’s go.

142
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:25,088
I’m here with Fay Crocker,
horn player and recording expert
at Cayuga High School.

143
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,675
Now, what would you like
to tell us about yourself, Fay?
Uh...

144
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,803
I don’t know.
Come on, it’s spinning, sister.
Let’s bake biscuits.

145
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,723
Uh, this is Fay... Wait.

146
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:38,060
What does that mean?
Well, it means to record,
make records. You...

147
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,812
You need a cigarette.
Everyone smokes
with a microphone.

148
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,541
I don’t wanna smoke right now.
Don’t cramp the cool.
It’s just something to hold.

149
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,610
It’s like a prop.
It’ll make you more confident.
Now, give me your horn.

150
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,779
I’m not allowed to let
anyone carry my horn.
Why?

151
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,462
If it gets dropped,
I have to pay for it.

152
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,241
School owns it.
No sweat. Let’s go.

153
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,870
Uh, bacon, bacon, 940.
What is that?

154
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:01,124
I heard it in a war movie.
They don’t say "bacon,
bacon, 940" during a war.

155
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,062
Well, maybe we’re thinking
about different wars.
No, no, this is not war radio.

156
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,922
You gotta say
something buzzin’.

157
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,259
All right, hold it.
Walk over there to the Olivers.
We’ll interview them.

158
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,428
Everett, no! That’s...
That’s a terrible idea.
That’s not fun at all.

159
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,615
You have to answer
questions before
we let you into the game.

160
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,475
Well, hello, Everett.
Wh... What is this?
What’s going on?

161
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,662
We’re recording interviews.
I have Cayuga winning by eight.

162
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,789
- What are your thoughts
on the game?
- Need a light, Fay?

163
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,791
No, I’m just holding it like
people do with microphones.

164
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,568
Ask him a question.
I can’t.
You’re making me nervous.

165
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,088
It’s just a question.
Ask anyone about anything,
doesn’t matter.

166
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,781
Oh. Did you know that
a squirrel bit through
the wire in the gym?

167
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,158
- I did not know that. Tonight?
- Oh, I knew that.

168
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,452
It wasn’t tonight. It was
when Clem was still teaching.

169
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,830
Now ask her to tell you more.
Tell me more.

170
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,540
It was actually a chipmunk.

171
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,750
A chipmunk. That was it.
Hold the mic out to her.

172
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,752
- Tell me more.
- I don’t know any more.

173
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,921
Ask her what
her feelings are on chipmunks.

174
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,258
What’s your feelings on chipmunks?
Well, they’re cute

175
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,678
so long as they stay
out of people’s cars
and houses and hair.

176
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,282
- That was good.
Ask her if she wants to hear it.
- You wanna hear your biscuit?

177
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,391
What? My biscuit?
Yeah, we made a biscuit.

178
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,078
No... It’s not called a biscuit.
But you said
we were baking biscuits.

179
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,956
A recording is not a biscuit.
What’s this for?
Is this going on the air?

180
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,983
No, you’re not...
What kind of question is that?
You tune into the radio

181
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,295
to hear a family
talking in their car,
while they’re eating?

182
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,529
No, I guess not.
No, yeah, you don’t.
No one does.

183
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,632
There’s your answer, unfiltered,
brought to you by me.

184
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,867
Honey, you are too funny.
Where’d you get this bit?

185
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,179
It comes with the recorder.
You should try it.
All you got to do

186
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,830
is hold the microphone
up to your mouth.
Hey, Daisy.

187
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:24,041
You old enough to be
going to basketball games?
Yes.

188
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,436
I don’t know...
I think you gotta be
at least five years old.

189
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,338
I am five years old.
Well, look out now.
Good thing for that.

190
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,774
If you weren’t,
I’d have to take you home
and go to bed early.

191
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,926
Have fun at the game.
I like your haircut, fuzzy duck.

192
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,178
Thanks for including us.
Have a good night.
Bye!

193
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:39,139
- Press record, start talking about something.
- What do I say?

194
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,224
Give me your horn.
No.

195
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,308
I’m not gonna drop it.

196
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,434
Take the mic out.

197
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,561
Take it out.

198
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,039
Good. Now, what’s your
favorite subject in school?

199
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,689
Aren’t you
some big science girl?

200
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,775
Yes.
All right.
Tell me about science.

201
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,444
Be careful with my horn
or else you’ll have to
deal with Mr. Pike.

202
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:55,590
Did you know that Robby Ritter
set his horn behind the car
and they backed over it?

203
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,990
That’s good.

204
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,718
Did you know that
Robby Ritter set his horn

205
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,577
behind their car
and they backed over it?

206
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,330
Sorry, what’s that?
Hello, Fay.
Hi, Mr. Stemmons.

207
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,624
What’s this?
Is this a school project?

208
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,668
No, Everett’s just
having me ask people questions

209
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,646
and record them
on my tape recorder.
Well, it’s broken.

210
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,630
What?
It’s not turning.
It stopped working.

211
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,994
How? It’s brand-new.
I don’t know what happened.
I’m sorry.

212
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,902
I’m sorry, Mr. Stemmons.
We’ll record you another time.

213
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,053
Thanks for stopping.
We’ll record you another time.

214
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,972
That’s okay.
You guys have a good night.

215
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,683
- Can we fix it?
- Shh. It’s not broken.

216
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,935
Mr. Stemmons is a nowhere man.
He’s a full-on pale one.

217
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,437
We had to get out
of that conversation.
So it’s not broken?

218
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,161
No. You can’t waste tape, Fay,
not on a tombstone
like Mr. Stemmons.

219
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,443
Double-dealing devil-dog.
That had me so scared.

220
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,207
You know I paid for that
with my own money.

221
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,006
You can always do that
if someone’s a wet rag.

222
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,241
Tell them, "It’s broken.
We’ll have to reschedule."

223
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:42,202
Then you just never reschedule.
Well, I can’t
do that to someone.

224
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:44,496
Oh, yeah, you can.
Why not?
’Cause it’s lying.

225
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,016
It’s not lying.
It’s stopping someone from
embarrassing themselves.

226
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,602
Not if you don’t make them
feel embarrassed.
Putting up the numbers means

227
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,855
you got to get
what you want out of people,
not be afraid to cut them off

228
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,982
or tell them to shut up.
I’m not putting up any numbers.

229
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,606
I’m sorry, you two.
I’m gonna need to see a license for that.

230
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,469
Oh, this ain’t
no shotgun, Pappy Fred.
And you’re lucky it ain’t.

231
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,181
’Cause you’d all be dead.
Fay’s got a new recorder.

232
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,141
Talk to her.
Hey, ask them a question, Fay.

233
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,645
Okay, about what?
Uh...
Well, now I’m nervous again.

234
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,981
What is this?
It’s a tape recorder.

235
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,584
Ask if they ever heard
"bacon, bacon, 940" before?

236
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,610
Bacon? What are you...
Bacon, what?

237
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,738
I heard it in a war movie.
Now, hold the mic
to your mouth.

238
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,781
Have you ever heard
the phrase "bacon, bacon, 940"

239
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,200
in a war movie?
Now to his mouth.

240
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:24,703
I think you mean
"breaker, breaker."
That’s what it is.

241
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,830
See, I was close.
Whoa, cut the gas, cube.

242
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,166
You were a mile wide.
Do you have
your own show now, Fay?

243
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,543
Yeah, she does.
It’s called
Teenage Rendezvous

244
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,337
and her radio name
is Cayuga Queen.

245
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,797
She takes requests and tells
stories of young love.

246
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,758
That’s a great idea.
I should get my own show.

247
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,319
All right, start studying
for your license.

248
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,570
And learn how to ask a question.

249
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:41,595
What license?

250
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,888
A radio license, FCC.

251
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,139
You going to the game?
No.

252
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,433
We gotta work.
Oh, of course.

253
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,477
You do such a good job, honey.

254
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,720
How’s your mother?
Did Fay tell you
about the Grimaldis?

255
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:54,107
- About their dog
getting electrocuted?
- No. Ask Fay.

256
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,235
You need to stay out of
Fay’s business, Marjorie.

257
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,904
It’s not Fay’s business.
It’s the Grimaldis’ business.

258
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,533
She knows the whole business.
Just make sure you turn off
that tape machine.

259
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,661
- Oh, we’ll do exactly that.
- She knows the whole business.

260
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,288
- Shut your mouth, Marjie.
- Oh, look out now.

261
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,873
I didn’t say anything, Fred.

262
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:12,125
I could appear in court,
put my hand on a Bible...

263
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,169
Start walking.
This is marriage problems.

264
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,171
- Come on.
- I didn’t say anything.

265
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,507
In front of God and everyone?
Yeah, I am.

266
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,925
♪ And you rock
Around the world ♪

267
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,344
♪ You rock, rock, rock ♪

268
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,804
Tell me the word
on the Grimaldis.

269
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,448
I don’t talk about
other people’s business.

270
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,534
Then come up with some
other way to fill up
this tape recorder.

271
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,852
I can’t.
I just get so nervous

272
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,896
and I don’t know what to say.
Although, I was
enjoying it back there

273
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,291
when we got going,
asking them questions.
It’s just you and me talking.

274
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,735
Tell me the craziest
caller you ever had.
Oh, I know what I can tell you.

275
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,881
Not about a caller, but about
some science I was reading.
Can I tell you about that?

276
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:45,534
You certainly can,
Fay Cordelia Crocker.
That’s not my middle name.

277
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,829
I know it isn’t. I don’t care.
I mean, I didn’t know,
but I definitely don’t care.

278
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,545
What else you got in there?
Uh, just my mouthpiece
and some hairpins.

279
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:00,090
Hairpins?
Yeah. My mom says you can
stash hairpins anywhere,

280
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,302
and one day you’ll be
glad you did it.
Geez, that’s weird.

281
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,429
I just read about this,
and I think it’s boss.

282
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,574
Don’t make me feel
like a fool for liking it.
I would never.

283
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,601
Come on, let me have it.
Razz my berries.
All right, did you know

284
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,896
that there was actually
an experiment done this year,
in Lincoln, Nebraska,

285
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,815
for a radio-controlled car?
By RCA. Like a full-sized one.

286
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,235
Whoa, lay dead.
Yup. It’s called
"electronic highway control."

287
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,529
And this article says that
there’s a series of circuits

288
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,591
buried in the pavements with
little lights connected to them

289
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,992
so they can communicate to
the car through radio control

290
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,970
and take over steering
and braking. It’s crazy.
Whoa, whoa, wait.

291
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,205
This is an experiment?
They already did this?
Mm-hmm.

292
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,333
In Lincoln, Nebraska, in April.
You press a button
on the dash of the car

293
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,044
that says "electronic drive,"
and the car starts
to drive itself.

294
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,922
That’s incredible.
Yeah, I know.
And get this...

295
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,592
Well, actually, two things.
First of all, it can tell

296
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:47,179
if there’s a car stopped
up to a mile ahead, and it’ll
slow traffic automatically.

297
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,389
Like all cars at once,
like a school of fish.

298
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:53,727
And two,
it doesn’t need eyes to work,
so if your vision’s bad

299
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,106
or if it’s raining cats and dogs
outside or if your headlamps
won’t work too well,

300
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,109
then the car still works.
Oh, and a voice
will come over the radio

301
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,904
and give you directions.
So if you’re on the highway

302
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,865
and your exit’s coming up,
or if you need
to switch highways,

303
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:10,744
a voice will literally interrupt
your radio and tell you
that your exit’s approaching

304
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,872
so you can get back
behind the wheel
and take control again.

305
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,375
I know that was three things,
but when I read this,

306
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,618
I was like, "Wow, really?
Can all this really be true?"

307
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,504
And it is.
It’s 100% true.

308
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,464
Tested in April this year,
Lincoln, Nebraska.

309
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,548
This article’s in this
Science Digest, this issue.

310
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,028
A voice comes through
the radio, tells you
what direction to go?

311
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:30,055
It’s in this article. Read it.
Does it say
when this is gonna happen?

312
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,642
1974. And by 1990,
all roads will be electronic.

313
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,812
Oh, really?
You don’t believe me, do you?

314
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,915
You’re just pulling my leg.
No, I’m not
pulling your leg.

315
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,233
I love it. I’m interviewing you.
I’m playing a part.

316
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,378
I just remembered
two more stories.
Do we have time to do those two?

317
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:46,196
Absolutely we do.
Let’s fill it up.
Well, if you like that,

318
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,920
brace your brain for this.
There’s this article
about these tubes...

319
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,951
You tell me all about it.
All right, hold on,

320
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,328
’cause you got to be able
to look past all these ads

321
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,247
and this squirrelly
beginner’s stuff.

322
00:15:56,832 --> 00:16:00,002
Hold on, ’cause
I wanna read it to you
the way it was written,

323
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,504
’cause I want it to have
the same effect on you.

324
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,633
All right, here you go.
So, "Picture a man

325
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:09,344
in New York City,
in Times Square.

326
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,055
And he walks down a set of
stairs into a subway tunnel,

327
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,641
and he boards a train car.
And he stows his suitcase

328
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,936
in a rack over
his head and sits down.
He starts reading a book.

329
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,689
And about an hour later
he feels the train
coming to a stop.

330
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,984
So he gets up,
gathers his things,
grabs his suitcase,

331
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,987
puts on his hat,
steps out of the train,
heads up some stairs

332
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,156
and comes out
at the Golden Gate Bridge."

333
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,326
What? Whoa.
How is that possible?
I know. Isn’t that crazy?

334
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,829
So the train travels
between 2,000
and 5,000 miles per hour

335
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,266
in these tubes,
all across the country.
That’s how it’s all gonna be.

336
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,334
It’s called
vacuum tube transportation.

337
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,419
All these tubes
crisscross all of the world,

338
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,439
so we’re gonna sit in cars
that run through the tubes

339
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,673
like hot dogs
through a garden hose.
Wait a minute.

340
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,818
It’s gonna be everywhere
by the year 2000.
Wait a minute...

341
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,094
It’s in this article here.
Wait a minute. Hold on.

342
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,864
Does this mean that the whole
other thing won’t happen?

343
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,431
The radio cars and the highway?

344
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,309
No.

345
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,645
I think that’ll be
for shorter distances.

346
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,706
This will replace things
like trains and airplanes.

347
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,357
Oh, is that so?
Yeah, I think so.

348
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,817
Like, even over oceans?
I think.

349
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,237
Hmm.
Actually, I don’t know.
It doesn’t say.

350
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,048
All right, looks like
we got time for one more.

351
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,199
Are you ready with your
third story, Miss Crocker?

352
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,992
Yes. Hold on.

353
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,887
Actually, do I have time
for two more or just one?

354
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:18,413
No, just one, I’m afraid.
Come on.
All right, well...

355
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:21,559
I’m gonna end with this one
because my mom doesn’t think
this is ever gonna happen,

356
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,294
and she said they just
say things like this
to sell magazines.

357
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,797
What an intriguing setup, Fay.
Please, go on.

358
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,966
Okay. Well, in the future,

359
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,427
every baby will be assigned
a telephone number at birth
and it’ll be his for life.

360
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:36,348
And we’ll all have
palm-sized dials, like
a clamshell with no receiver.

361
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:40,352
Or... well, I guess
we’ll have little speakers
and microphones instead.

362
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,896
And on one side,
you’ll have the dial.
And on the back...

363
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,834
The back will be
a Lilliput screen, so like
a miniature television screen.

364
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,986
And you can keep it
in your pocket, so you can
call your friend in Rome

365
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,655
or New York or anywhere

366
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:55,033
and see his face on your dial
and have a conversation,
in color.

367
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,970
The screens
will be in color.
Which magazine is that?

368
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:59,413
Modern Mechanix.
This article’s
a couple years old.

369
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:03,166
But, oh, it also said
that if you call your friend
and he doesn’t answer,

370
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,979
then you know they’re dead.
What? Why would you
know they’re dead?

371
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:09,023
They always have it with them
so they can always answer.
I don’t believe that.

372
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,276
What? Here, you can see
a picture of it.
That sounds like a space novel.

373
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,027
I know.
I think I agree
with your mom, you know.

374
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,678
She’s a wise keeper.

375
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,763
I believe the train tubes
and the highways,

376
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,474
but the tiny TV telephones,
that’s cuckoo.

377
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,894
All right.
Hey, it’s been fun.

378
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,770
I gotta run. Tune in.
All right? Tune in.

379
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,647
I will. Thank you.
Oh, look out now.

380
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,097
I got my tape recorder.
What’s that?

381
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,350
I got my tape recorder.
That’s right. Is that it?

382
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,286
Yeah, it’s the Westinghouse one.
And me and Everett

383
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,205
just recorded ourselves
all the way over from the gym.

384
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:08,065
You got the one
he told you about?
Yeah, listen.

385
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,359
Rome
or New York or anywhere

386
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,945
and see his face and have
a conversation with him...

387
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,697
How neat, Fay.
He is such a fun boy.

388
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,242
He said when you record,
it’s called "baking biscuits."

389
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,826
- "Baking biscuits"?
- Yeah.

390
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,870
- Well, I’ll be.
- Yeah.

391
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:24,373
Did you get a look
at those Pocasset boys?
Just for a sec.

392
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,209
They were getting off
the bus. They were tall.

393
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,545
- Oh, no. Really?
- Yeah.

394
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:33,465
They got a bunch
of Indian boys on their team,
about four or five of them.

395
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,636
I think there’s
a couple of families, like four
or five brothers or cousins.

396
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,639
Probably means they’re
gonna beat us like a drum.

397
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,807
And I don’t mean that
because they’re Indians.

398
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,161
When they put on their jerseys,
they looked like grown-ups.
That means we’re gonna lose.

399
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,272
Hey, were the lights
flickering in here at all?
No. Why?

400
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:52,568
Oh, just ’cause they were
flickering over at the school.
Arlo’s working on it though.

401
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,153
Last time,
when I was still teaching,
it was a squirrel.

402
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,865
Bit through a wire.
All right, I’m off.

403
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:00,659
Oh, the line to San Mirial
has got a permanent signal,

404
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:03,847
so it’s skunked, so if you
wanna plug that out, it would
let Fran and Judith know.

405
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,497
Okay, bye.

406
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,128
Number, please?

407
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,426
Number, please?

408
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:42,117
This is WOTW radio
in Cayuga, New Mexico,

409
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:44,620
and this is the news
for the hour.
Boeing has introduced

410
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,331
its new line...

411
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,084
- Number, please?
- Officer Sherman declared

412
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,944
the incident was caused by,
and I quote...

413
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,153
Number, please?

414
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,411
Hello?

415
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,504
Top-secret concept.

416
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,841
Name of city, inward.

417
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,717
Hey, Winnie. It’s me.

418
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,961
Can you tell me if you’ve ever
heard this sound before?

419
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,896
- You ever heard that?
- No, but put it back on.

420
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,149
Let me let some of
the other ladies listen.
Okay.

421
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,156
Listen, Winnie,
I got another call
coming through,

422
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,990
so I’ll call you back
a little later.

423
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,955
- Number, please?
- Hello?

424
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,251
Hello?

425
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,837
Hello?
Listen, ma’am, can...
can you disconnect

426
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,380
and then try again?
It’s all...

427
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,925
We’re calling... It’s a strange,

428
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,096
large object holding
over my land off of a...

429
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,682
like a tornado...

430
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:31,768
swirling faster.
Please, send the police...

431
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,604
Ma’am, is this an emergency?

432
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,606
Because there’s something
in the canyon.

433
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,917
Can you tell me
where you are?
We’re going in the cellar.

434
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,419
Hello?

435
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,945
Hey, Josie, listen.
It’s Fay.

436
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:25,197
Is Officer Pruitt
or Boker around?

437
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,991
He’s not here
and Mr. Pruitt left with him.

438
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,595
Well, they didn’t answer
at the station.
No one’s at the station?

439
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:34,039
They were here, but a trucker
just reported something.

440
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,542
What?
He didn’t say.
It whipped the wind up

441
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,020
and made him spill
his truck, so avocados
are all over the road.

442
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,296
Is Officer Abbott around?
Off duty?

443
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,675
Isn’t Judy cheerleading?
Yes, but I haven’t
seen him.

444
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:49,221
Can you try and find him?
He probably left with
Mr. Boker and Mr. Pruitt.

445
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:52,516
What’s going on?
I don’t know.
Probably nothing.

446
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,352
Listen, Josie, I got
another call coming in.

447
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,855
Can you let me know
if you hear anything?
Okay. Bye.

448
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:01,900
- Name of city, inward.
- Fay, where’d you go?

449
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:03,944
Winnie, we got
a call coming through,

450
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:06,196
and the same sound
came from her line,

451
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,657
but I... I couldn’t get
her name or anything.

452
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,201
- She didn’t sound hurt.
- What should I do?

453
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,371
Winnie?

454
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,165
Winnie?

455
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:19,585
Winnie?

456
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,058
Hello?
Ethel, hi.

457
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,742
Are you listening
to the radio right now?

458
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,568
No, I was watching TV.

459
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:41,166
Can you turn
your radio on and tell me
if you hear any kind of sound?

460
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,816
Like what?
Like...

461
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,693
something that just came in
through the board

462
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:46,486
a couple minutes ago,
and I wanted to...

463
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,031
It went away.
I just wanted to see if it...

464
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:52,117
Just call Everett.
I don’t wanna
disturb him on the air.

465
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:54,578
Don’t be shy with him.
He doesn’t care if you call...

466
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:57,915
Ethel?

467
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,542
Ethel?

468
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,861
Hello?
Grace, hi.

469
00:25:27,945 --> 00:25:29,745
Can you run over
and check on Ethel and Maddy?

470
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,865
I tried the Van Ortons,
but they’re at the game.

471
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,825
I’m afraid everyone’s
at the game right now.

472
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,953
Who is this, now?
It’s Fay.

473
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:39,957
Oh. My lands.
When I can’t see a face,
my perception gets pickled.

474
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,583
Can you go check
on Ethel and Maddy?

475
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,502
I suppose so.
Is everything okay?

476
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,296
I’m in the kitchen
with my hands in
a ball of cookie dough.

477
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,132
I think so.
It’s just... I called Ethel
and the line got cut.

478
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:53,011
We’re having a lot of
connection issues.
Well, let’s see.

479
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:55,931
Can I get my hands washed off
and my cookie sheet in the oven?

480
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:59,768
Or do you need me to go now?
I can go now, but I might
dirty up the doorknobs.

481
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:01,932
You can wash your hands.
Whenever you get the chance.

482
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:05,190
I’m sure it’s fine.
Where’s your mother?

483
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:08,151
She’s working nights.
Oh, I remember her
telling me that.

484
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:11,655
Sorry for calling you so late.
I tried Gertie Van Orton,
but they’re at the game.

485
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,867
Everyone’s at the game
right now.
It’s not a bother.

486
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,719
Let me get this finished up,
and I’ll go check

487
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:19,371
and I’ll call you back.
It’s Ethel babysitting?

488
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:22,040
Yes.
All right.
Give me a few minutes.

489
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,626
All right. Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Mm-hmm. Bye-bye.

490
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:31,383
Oh, and there it goes.
Spinning away.

491
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:35,012
Jimmy Rain and Crocs
with their crankin’ song
"Hoppin’ and Cookin’."

492
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,990
You’re listening to Everett
"the Maverick" Sloan,

493
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:39,057
and the show, as you know,
is Highway Hits,

494
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:41,727
brought to you
by Santa Mira Mills
and Cloverbloom Honey,

495
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,230
with a co-sponsorship from
our business of the week,
the Udder Stand,

496
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:50,068
providing the whole valley
with the coldest confections
and the sweetest slurgs.

497
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,196
We know it’s a busy night
out there for everyone

498
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,115
with the first game
of the season and
a valley rivalry at that.

499
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:57,326
But just remember,
during basketball season,

500
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:01,288
the Udder Stand closes
for the games and reopens
after for one hour

501
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,207
for those who need
a little late night snack

502
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,792
before you start
driving your tanks home

503
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,879
and piling up some Z’s.
That’s the word from the bird.

504
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,673
It’s a silent night in here
when the Statesmen are playing.

505
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:13,800
But for the five of you
out there listening,

506
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:15,604
jump on the horn,
give us your dedications,

507
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:17,638
and let everyone know
you’re out there.

508
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,741
We hope you stick around and
follow us till the sign off.

509
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:22,559
WOTW time now,
12 minutes past the hour.

510
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:25,103
Look out now.
62 degrees outside.

511
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:27,564
Stick with our station
and get lost in our sounds,

512
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:30,150
coming at you now
starting with Gabe Gunton

513
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:33,278
singing "Screamin’ Scooch"
here on Highway Hits.

514
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,794
This is WOTW, Everett
"The Maverick" Sloan.

515
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:51,296
Everett, it’s Fay. I’m sorry.
Please don’t be mad at me.

516
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,882
I thought you were a caller.
I’m sorry.
I knew you’d think that.

517
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:55,693
Please don’t be mad.
Is it about
the tape recorder?

518
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,344
No, a sound came
through the board

519
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,179
and interrupted your radio show.

520
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,390
I don’t know. It’s never
come through over here.

521
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:04,268
Interrupted my show?
Yeah, through the radio.

522
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,854
What’d it sound like?
I don’t know. I can
connect you through.

523
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:08,939
Did it sound Mexican?
No, it didn’t
sound Mexican.

524
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,149
We cross signals
with this station in Mexico...

525
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,110
It sounded like something
that could be unsafe.

526
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,070
We had this lady...
Whoa, why? How?

527
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,173
Nothing sounded different here.
How long ago was it?

528
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:18,740
Right at the beginning
of the news.

529
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:24,079
Are you mad at me?
No, but I don’t know
what you want me to do.

530
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:27,207
It was probably your radio.
Can you listen to the sound?

531
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,602
Is it the same sound you
heard interrupt my show?
Yeah, mostly.

532
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,646
They came through
on top of each other.
All right. Connect it.

533
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,046
All right.

534
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,264
I’ve never heard that
before.

535
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:44,183
Yeah, me neither.
And then this lady called.

536
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,351
She said there was something
going on out of town

537
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:49,688
and she was going down to her
cellar and then that sound
came through on her line.

538
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,733
Then I called Ethel
’cause she’s babysitting Maddy,
and her line got cut.

539
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,496
And when did you say
my show got cut into?

540
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:56,612
Right at the beginning
of the news.

541
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:59,448
I didn’t hear it,
but it’s a closed circuit,

542
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,926
so if it went out
from the station,
it’ll be recorded on playback.

543
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,137
So you stay on the line while
I rewind it and play it back,

544
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:05,388
and I’ll let you know
if I hear anything.

545
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:08,624
Okay.

546
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:11,293
This is WOTW radio
in Cayuga, New Mexico,

547
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,045
and this is the news
for the hour.

548
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:14,796
Boeing has introduced
its new line of...

549
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:19,092
That was it.

550
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:20,719
What?
That was it.

551
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,846
It came through
just like that.
I’ll be.

552
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,391
What? Why? Is it bad?
That’s a good question.

553
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:29,353
If it’s foreign or code,
the Air Force
will be coming to town.

554
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,730
Really?
Oh, yeah.

555
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,191
Will we get in trouble?
We haven’t done anything.

556
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:35,275
Yeah, that’s true.

557
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:41,782
Okay, yeah, yeah, that’s true.

558
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,553
Send me that signal again
and I’ll put it on the air.

559
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,657
If anyone’s listening,
maybe they’ll know something.

560
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,248
And you sure
we won’t get in trouble?

561
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:50,791
I don’t care.
This is good radio.

562
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:57,464
Okay, I’m doing it.
Here, I’m sending the signal.

563
00:29:57,548 --> 00:29:59,609
Don’t call me for ten minutes,
unless someone calls in.

564
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,694
I don’t want false alarms.
Watch your clock. Ten minutes.

565
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:04,012
I understand.
I’ll wait for the calls.
Here you go.

566
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,661
There it was, just like
I said it would be.

567
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:12,330
That was Gabe Gunton,
followed by "Crazy Waves"
from The Golden Glows.

568
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:14,898
It’s 7:18 here at WOTW.

569
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:18,527
Listen up, we got
a quick query for anyone
that wants to take a crack.

570
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,531
We’ve got a sound that
seems to be sort of bouncing
around the valley tonight.

571
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:24,717
And we’d like
to know your thoughts.
We’re standing by the phones

572
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,743
and we’d love to know
if there’s an old expert

573
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:29,997
or youth ham operator
we don’t know about that’s
tangling up our antenna.

574
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,040
For the caller who can
help us out and tell us

575
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:35,210
what the sound is, we’ve got
a free piece of Elvis’s carpet,

576
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,504
pulled directly from
his floor in Memphis.

577
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:39,715
Lines are open.
Please call
with any information.

578
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:26,173
Passing off
with a little handoff.

579
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:28,091
Another little handoff.

580
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:29,259
And a third one.

581
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,846
And looks like...
Oh, there it is.

582
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,391
He’s gonna get the ball
and take it down the court.

583
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:40,062
And he’s gonna go
and he’s gonna pass the ball.

584
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:43,065
Another pass. And looks like
he’s gonna go for the shot.

585
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:45,150
No. He’s gonna hand it off.
Okay.

586
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:47,569
Got to...
There’s the shot.
And two more points.

587
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,279
I think he can make it
from anywhere.

588
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,909
Passing off.

589
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,994
There it is.

590
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:05,272
- We got a caller.
- Put him through.

591
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:08,525
- He’s from out of town.
He might know something.
-Then put him through. Please.

592
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:09,985
Sir, we are connecting you now.

593
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:14,031
Hello, sir.
This is Everett Sloan.
Can you hear me?

594
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:16,158
Hello, yes. How are you?

595
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:18,785
I’m good.
Can I get your name?
Yes, my name is Billy.

596
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:21,705
Billy. Okay.
Thank you, Billy.

597
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,058
And I need to tell you first
we don’t allow any swear words

598
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:26,877
or inappropriate stories
on the air
or I could lose my job.

599
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,505
I don’t have a delay and I wanna
put you right onto the air,

600
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:32,132
but I need you to promise me
that we’re safe in doing so.

601
00:35:32,216 --> 00:35:34,468
Of course. I understand.

602
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,720
I don’t swear or talk
like that anyway in my life.

603
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,032
Okay, I’m breaking the rules
to do this, so please, you know,

604
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:42,142
be honest and ask
if something needs to be
discussed off the air

605
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,245
and I’ll go to a break
or put on a record, all right?

606
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:45,646
Okay. I can do that.

607
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,148
We are going
on the air here shortly,

608
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:49,399
in three...

609
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,027
two...

610
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:54,613
one.

611
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:58,867
We’re back. Sorry to cut
that last song short,

612
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:01,012
but we do have a caller here
who may know something.

613
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:04,122
Now, Billy, would you mind
telling us all what you know?

614
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:06,208
Yes, I have a story
that might be helpful.

615
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,419
I don’t know, it may not be,
but I’ll go ahead.

616
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:11,547
All right, Billy.
Well, we’re listening.

617
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,841
Well, so I was,
uh, in the military,

618
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:16,677
and there were always jobs

619
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,097
and work we didn’t know
anything about.

620
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,492
- What do you mean?
- I mean we would get assigned

621
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:24,935
to places without
knowing where we were,

622
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,312
to do things
none of us understood,

623
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:29,314
which is normal in the military.

624
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:32,150
And one night, I was
woken up by my superior.

625
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:35,320
He had me get into uniform
and report for duty.

626
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:39,366
Then a carrier plane landed
and they loaded me up by myself.

627
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:42,494
We made, uh,
several more stops,
picking up other guys.

628
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,955
Then we, uh, flew
for at least two hours.

629
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:48,667
And when we landed,
they loaded us up into a bus,

630
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,336
but this one had all
of the windows painted black

631
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,590
so there was no telling
where we were going.

632
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:58,760
Then when we arrived,
it was, uh, still
desert scrubs and flatlands.

633
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:01,221
But, uh, there were
tents and tunnels

634
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:04,349
and underground labs
or test bunkers or something.

635
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:05,976
And I pretty quickly got briefed

636
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,437
by some officer I’d never seen,

637
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,399
and he told us everything
we were seeing was classified

638
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,526
and if we ever spoke about it,

639
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:18,322
it would endanger America
and they would know.

640
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:23,160
And we were all sent
to this rocky,
kind of sandy alcove,

641
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:26,538
and they had us
start digging a square hole

642
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:28,290
with their
digging machines and such.

643
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:33,253
And we built walls out of blocks
and a concrete floor and such.

644
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:35,172
And we built windows
that connected

645
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,508
to a viewing room
and ventilation.

646
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:40,469
And they had us sleep
in this room filled with cots,

647
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:43,013
war supplies, all underground.

648
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:45,557
Then one morning, we woke up
and reported to duty,

649
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,393
and there was something
enormous in that hole,

650
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:50,229
covered in a tarp.

651
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:52,231
Wh... What do you mean?

652
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:54,399
Uh, it was bigger
than an airplane,

653
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:57,110
but no one
was allowed to see it.

654
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:59,321
And there were guards
surrounding it all day.

655
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:01,240
Well, what’d it look like?

656
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:03,951
Mostly smooth,
but it looked
broken or damaged,

657
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:06,578
’cause there were
some rough patches.

658
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:08,539
You think it was American?

659
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:10,749
There was no way to know.
Uh...

660
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:12,668
You don’t ask
anything like that.

661
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:16,255
We want to know just like
anybody wants to know
about somethin’.

662
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:19,800
But you trust your superiors
and you follow orders.

663
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:24,638
But this one...
worried me.

664
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:26,890
And why is that?

665
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:29,017
Probably ’cause
it was so secretive.

666
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:32,980
So what happened next?

667
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:36,900
Well, we built the ceiling
over this thing, carefully.

668
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:39,570
And then when they
were done with us,

669
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:41,905
they got us all
boarded on a plane.

670
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:44,616
And when the propellers
had started spinning

671
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,743
and we were about to take off,

672
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:48,787
and the radio started
playing this sound.

673
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:51,290
What sound?

674
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,710
The same sound
you just played tonight.

675
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,421
You sure it was the same?

676
00:38:58,714 --> 00:38:59,965
Oh, I couldn’t forget it.

677
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:04,595
And when we finally took off
and I looked out the window,

678
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:07,931
you could see guys were
starting to cover the airstrip

679
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,475
with dirt, like
we never been there.

680
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,062
And then the sound disappeared
and we got further away.

681
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:17,524
And when I got back, then I
started getting really sick.

682
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:19,318
And in the next few weeks,
I developed

683
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:21,904
some kind of lung condition.

684
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:23,906
So now I didn’t breathe so good.

685
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:27,409
And I think whatever...
That area of the desert

686
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:29,411
caused it or something.

687
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:31,038
Maybe radiation.

688
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,582
’Cause I was always healthy.

689
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:36,293
Then I got time
at the military hospital.

690
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:39,171
And then a couple years later,
I saw one of the guys

691
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:42,341
who had been on that detail
with me in the desert.

692
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:45,385
And I asked him
if he’d got sick afterwards,

693
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:47,429
and he said he had.

694
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:51,517
And then he told me that
that was the second time

695
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,145
he’d been picked up
for something up like that.

696
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,564
And he told me about a night

697
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:59,816
when he’d been
commissioned in Nevada

698
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,694
and he was taken
to the Colorado River

699
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:05,197
where there was a river barge

700
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,242
carrying something
twice its size down the river.

701
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,953
And when they got
several hours down the river,

702
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:12,955
there was a makeshift station,

703
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:17,751
and they unloaded the cargo
onto two Army trucks.

704
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:20,087
And when they got done
loading it up,

705
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,340
the same sound we heard
out in the desert

706
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:28,804
also went through
all of the radios there
on the ground and on the barge.

707
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:33,642
And then he said
the two Army trucks
drove off into the night

708
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,394
and the sound faded with them.

709
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:39,606
So did he know what it was?

710
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:42,568
No.

711
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:46,280
But since our
detail in the desert,
he’d asked around

712
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:49,783
and he’d heard
about another guy
that knew about the noises.

713
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:53,745
So we met up with him off-base,

714
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:56,206
but he only knew pieces.

715
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,458
Everybody only knows pieces
in the military.

716
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,377
Nobody knows the whole thing.

717
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,379
And that’s part of the plan.

718
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:06,633
Which is why
they pieced together teams
from all over the country

719
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:10,554
and only brought us in
for one task at a time.

720
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:13,098
So no one would know everything.

721
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:16,310
Wait, I’m sorry.
You’re gonna have to be clearer.

722
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:18,312
Is this sound a military sound?

723
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:23,108
That’s what we asked
this guy at Walker.

724
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:26,195
And what did he say?

725
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:27,863
He said
it wasn’t military.

726
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:33,076
It wasn’t military
from any country.

727
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,496
It was coming from
thousands of feet higher
than anything could fly.

728
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:39,791
How did he know that?

729
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:43,045
’Cause he was
a radar operator.

730
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:45,297
- So are these signals frequent?
- No.

731
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,692
Can I ask... I’m assuming
this was before Sputnik.

732
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,010
This was
years before Sputnik.

733
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:51,887
And signals like yours

734
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,097
have been caught
going back and forth.

735
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:57,434
- What do you mean?
- Like communication.

736
00:41:57,518 --> 00:42:01,396
Like one says something here
in this part of the sky

737
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,357
and another says something back.

738
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,984
Sometimes
they were recorded
at Sputnik heights

739
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:08,862
and sometimes
just a few hundred feet
off the ground.

740
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:12,741
Where?
Lots of places.
All over.

741
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:17,664
What do you mean all over?

742
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,291
Billy?

743
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:25,671
Billy, I...
Think we lost you. Billy?

744
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,360
Well, for the five of you
out there listening,
it looks like we lost Billy.

745
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:33,846
Let me work on getting him
back on the air.
I’m back in a moment.

746
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:36,783
Fay, what happened?
I don’t know. He got cut.
That’s what’s been happening...

747
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:38,167
- We gotta get him back.
- I can’t.

748
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:40,310
- Why not?
- I have no idea where he lives.

749
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:41,979
Then call the board by Holloman.

750
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:43,706
We can’t. He probably
gave a fake name or...

751
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,400
- You can’t dial back
out the line?
- It doesn’t work like that.

752
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,795
- Look him up in the phone book.
- Under Billy near Holloman?

753
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,779
Uh... I know. I know.

754
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:53,073
Damn it.

755
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:55,576
Hold on, we got a call,
we got a call!

756
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:57,804
- Name of city, inward.
- Alamogordo operator.

757
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:58,829
Connecting.

758
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:03,166
Cayuga, number please.
Yes, this is Billy.

759
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,460
I’ll connect you!
Here he is, Everett.

760
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:08,672
Billy. What’s going on?
We need your real number.

761
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:10,591
I’m sorry, but I can’t do that.

762
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,467
Okay, then I can’t
put you back on the air.

763
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:14,928
I would like to, but there’s
a breach of ethics here,

764
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:17,514
’cause I have no way of knowing
if what you’re saying is true.

765
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:19,600
I know. I understand.

766
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:21,185
I don’t mean
to put you in a place

767
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:22,603
that would get you
into problems.

768
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:24,062
Billy, I have to ask...

769
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:25,373
Why are you telling us all this?

770
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:27,524
Is this gonna get us in trouble?

771
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:29,985
I suppose I’m telling you
’cause I’m sick.

772
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:33,197
And I’m old.

773
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,365
And no one listens to us.

774
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:37,367
And I want people to know
what we did for them.

775
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,661
Why do you think
no one listens to you?

776
00:43:39,745 --> 00:43:42,080
I think part of it’s
’cause I’m black.

777
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:47,669
I’m sorry
if that’s a problem.
No, I don’t think it is.

778
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:50,923
I thought
that might be the case.

779
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:54,718
We’ve just never had
a black caller before.

780
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:59,765
I’m sorry,
I should have
probably told you that.

781
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:02,935
But everyone
on these details
were black.

782
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:05,312
Or Mexican.
All of us doing sweat work.

783
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:06,939
You think they
did that on purpose?

784
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:10,150
I know they did.
Why?

785
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:13,570
’Cause who’s
gonna listen to us?

786
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:17,866
But there’s
a part of all this
that you can check into

787
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,118
so that you know
I’m not making this up.

788
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:22,621
Okay, I think we need that,
’cause, you can see why,

789
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:24,665
at this point,
all we have is your word.

790
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:27,167
There’s one gentleman
I’ll tell you about
in a minute.

791
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:29,354
I’m sorry to interrupt, Billy,
but I’m still recording this

792
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:31,098
even though we’re not
on the air, all right?

793
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:34,842
Uh, yes, please do.
Okay. Go ahead, Billy.

794
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:37,344
And so this guy we talked to
at Walker Base,

795
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:39,888
the radar operator
who we met off-site,

796
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:43,642
after he retired,
he didn’t stop
with the signals.

797
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:46,144
In fact, he started
waiting for them

798
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:49,481
and was trying to record
one of them on his own,

799
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:53,443
using radio and war surplus
equipment he repaired.

800
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:55,112
And did he ever get anything?

801
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:56,488
Yeah, he did.

802
00:44:57,573 --> 00:45:00,450
Finally.
It took a long time,

803
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:03,495
but one night
he finally got one.

804
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:05,330
And recorded it.

805
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:06,790
And then he made copies

806
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:09,751
and mailed them
to a bunch of us...

807
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:14,047
guys who had been, uh, around
some of these hidden details.

808
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:15,757
What did he think
these signals were?

809
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:20,721
Well, that’s where
you have to make the jump.

810
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:25,058
Because he told us
it’s something talking

811
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:27,060
and then disappearing,

812
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:30,564
something very high
that we can’t see.

813
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,860
And he made copies?
Yes.

814
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:36,945
And he sent them to us.

815
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:40,115
Different guys on these details
here in the area.

816
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:45,829
And when I finally got my tape
and got to a player,
and I played it back...

817
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:49,374
it made my hair stand up on end.

818
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,293
Why?

819
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:53,128
’Cause they were the same sounds

820
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:55,088
I’d heard out in the desert.

821
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,887
Do you still have
that tape?
No.

822
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:05,182
I didn’t want to be caught
with it, so I burned it.

823
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:07,643
But one of the other guys,
another Air Force gentleman

824
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:10,604
who had been on one of
these security details

825
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,191
and heard these noises, too,
and he lives in Cayuga,

826
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:17,152
so he got sent a tape
just like mine.

827
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:18,796
That’s what I thought
you were playing.
Wait.

828
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,864
There’s one in Cayuga?
With who?

829
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:23,242
Raymond Buck,
an ex-Air Force gentleman.

830
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:25,869
So he was mailed a tape with
one of these signals on it?

831
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:27,454
But Raymond Buck died.

832
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:30,791
Oh, no.
Did you say
he passed away?

833
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,251
Yes.

834
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:36,672
I thought that
may have happened.

835
00:46:37,756 --> 00:46:39,049
I’m sorry, Billy.

836
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:44,137
Well, I didn’t
know him well, you know.

837
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:47,891
Do you know where
his tape would be?

838
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:50,519
No. Maybe if he had kids?

839
00:46:50,602 --> 00:46:52,896
No, Mrs. Buck gave all
his tapes to the library.

840
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,898
There’s not a tape recorder
in the library, Fay.

841
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:56,835
There is.
It’s in the basement.
They haven’t had a chance

842
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:58,878
to look at all the tapes,
so they haven’t put it out.

843
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:00,547
No, the library’s closed and
no one will be at the board.

844
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:02,291
Everyone’s at the game.
No one’s gonna call.

845
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:03,907
I know how to get into
the library.

846
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:10,080
Billy, what do
you think it’ll do
if we can find it and play it?

847
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:13,375
I don’t know.

848
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,338
But if you’re gonna do it,
you better do it...

849
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:21,466
’cause something’s up there now.

850
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:24,428
And they don’t stay for long.

851
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:33,729
Okay, Fay, run.

852
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,501
Get in!

853
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:22,296
- Did you steal a car?
- Did you get them? No.

854
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:23,773
Yes. Come on, get in.
Did you get them?

855
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:25,757
I stole a bicycle!
Answer me.

856
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:27,301
- Uh, yes, I got them.
- All right.

857
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:29,720
Whose car is this?
Mr. McKean’s.

858
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:32,264
Does Mr. McKean know?
Of course not.

859
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:40,814
Are you gonna give Billy
a piece of Elvis’s carpet?

860
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:43,025
What?
You said you’d give
the caller who helped us

861
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:44,568
a piece of Elvis’s carpet.

862
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,195
Oh.

863
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:51,092
Yeah, no, that’s
not really Elvis’s carpet.

864
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:52,876
It was, but we gave it
all away a while back.

865
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:54,995
So now Jack Sage
and Red Gant have both scraps,

866
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:57,122
and we give away carpet
from Jess Pervis’s house.

867
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:58,832
Everett, that’s lying.

868
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:01,001
People really think
that’s Elvis’s carpet.

869
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,671
Shut up, Fay.

870
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:26,026
Billy? It’s Fay,
the Cayuga operator.

871
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:27,402
We got a lot of tapes here.

872
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:28,987
Do you remember
which one it was?

873
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:30,781
It’s been a long time,

874
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:32,699
but I think it was clear.

875
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:34,910
They’re all clear, Billy.

876
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:37,871
Billy?

877
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:41,792
The line cut.
What?

878
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:43,585
Billy?

879
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:48,066
I can’t reconnect him without
going back to the board.

880
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:50,551
Yeah, don’t go. Just hand me
those one at a time.

881
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:51,802
And get out of my chair.

882
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:57,474
So you don’t believe
Mr. Billy?

883
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,351
I don’t know.

884
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:05,899
But if there’s something
in the sky, I want to know.

885
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:10,779
Baxter is a four-year...

886
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:12,197
No.

887
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:13,282
Next one.

888
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,078
How you know what
you’re looking for?
I don’t.

889
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:21,582
Could he have
recorded over it?
Uh, yeah.

890
00:51:21,665 --> 00:51:25,419
Yeah, absolutely.
Unfortunately.

891
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:31,925
So I did and...

892
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:38,515
What is that recorder?
This is the Maggie PT-6.

893
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:41,101
Maggie?
Yeah, for Magnecord.

894
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:43,312
It’s like the broadcast brother
to your recorder.

895
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:45,606
It’s how we play
the games and ads.

896
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:47,608
People really listen
to the games the next day,

897
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:49,651
even though they
know what happened?
Yeah, they do.

898
00:51:49,735 --> 00:51:52,672
They don’t care they know.
They just wanna hear
their kid’s name on the radio.

899
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:54,323
♪ Silent night ♪

900
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:56,950
♪ Holy night... ♪
That’s not it.

901
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,164
Is any of this gonna
get you in trouble?

902
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:03,916
Well, if it does, I don’t care.

903
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:05,792
This is good radio.

904
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:07,920
And it’ll get me
a better job somewhere else.

905
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:13,759
Where would you wanna go?
I don’t know.

906
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:15,487
At that point...
Probably West Coast.

907
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:17,471
That’s where everything’s
happening in radio.

908
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:24,520
I wanna get out, too.

909
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:27,648
Not till Maddy’s older,
of course, but sometime.

910
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:32,110
To where? To do what?
Want to go to college?

911
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:35,906
Eh, probably just to work on
a bigger switchboard somewhere.

912
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:38,575
Right now, I could work
in a hospital or a hotel

913
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:40,244
or a school
on their switchboard.

914
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:42,829
But if I wanna work
on a bigger board,

915
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:44,373
I’d have to transfer
to a bigger city

916
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:46,166
and get hired on
by the phone company.

917
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:49,378
No college?
Can’t afford college, Everett.

918
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:52,130
There’s loans.
You could look into that.

919
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,091
I’d love that.

920
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,228
Golly Moses.

921
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:08,146
Oh, Everett.

922
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:10,148
That’s it.

923
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:13,585
And it’s clearer.
What are you gonna do?

924
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:20,450
Folks, we got another sound
we do need your help with.

925
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:22,536
Listen up and let us know.

926
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,538
And, Billy,
if this is the sound,
give us a call.

927
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:26,540
All right.
Here it is, cats.

928
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:47,620
- Oh, my gosh.
- Everett?

929
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:49,062
Oh, my gosh.

930
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:50,540
Are you
playing a trick on me?

931
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:51,690
I’m not.

932
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:53,317
Hold still.
What’s going on?

933
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,194
Calm down. There’s
a flashlight somewhere.

934
00:53:55,277 --> 00:53:57,779
What’s going on, Everett?
Hey, Fay, calm down!

935
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,448
Silver flashlight.

936
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:04,578
I knew it was something.
I knew it. I knew it.

937
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,288
- Fuck.
- What’d you do?

938
00:54:06,371 --> 00:54:08,290
I didn’t do anything!
I don’t know!

939
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:09,666
There’s lights out here.

940
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:13,813
We... Damn it. We just
experienced a blackout
after playing that...

941
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:16,149
- What are you doing?
- I’m recording for later in case we got news.

942
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:18,592
- Why do you change
your voice like that?
- Like what?

943
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:21,029
When you’re on the radio,
you always change your voice!
Why do you do that?

944
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:22,679
’Cause that’s how radio sounds!

945
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:24,723
Look, I don’t need
your judgment right now.

946
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:28,227
Oh, no.
Ah, what?

947
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:30,562
- The switchboard!
- Fay, wait!

948
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:58,257
Goddamn, Fay!
Get in!

949
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:03,318
Oh, I shouldn’t have
been gone that long.

950
00:55:03,345 --> 00:55:05,180
Why you always running?
We drove here.

951
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:08,016
We don’t have a car.
I never ride in cars.
I walk everywhere.

952
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:11,812
All right, no sweat.

953
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,861
So you still don’t think
something’s going on?

954
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:22,406
I think if anything’s
happening, it’s that

955
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,616
we’re being spied on
or we’re about to
be invaded.

956
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,159
By who?
Soviets.

957
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:28,871
You really think so?
100%, absolutely.

958
00:55:28,954 --> 00:55:31,748
And this is exactly
where they’d come in, too,
southern border.

959
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:48,807
Number please.
Sorry for the wait.

960
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:51,852
Number please.
I’ll connect you.

961
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:53,103
Uh, I’m not sure.

962
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:54,813
No, you’re the first one to...

963
00:55:54,897 --> 00:55:56,315
Yes, we’ll let them know.
Thank you.

964
00:55:57,941 --> 00:56:00,068
Number please. Yes, we’re
notifying highway patrol.

965
00:56:00,152 --> 00:56:01,862
Uh, we’ll relay any news to you.

966
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:04,198
Thank you. Thank you.

967
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:05,782
Number please.
Sorry for the wait.

968
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:08,952
All right, thank you.
Goodbye.

969
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:10,412
Thank you. Goodbye.

970
00:56:12,122 --> 00:56:14,291
People are saying
there’s something in the sky.

971
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:21,423
It’s 7:45.
Write that down.

972
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:23,300
Can’t you just record it?
Yeah.

973
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:25,677
Folks, it is 7:45 p.m.
and we may have something...

974
00:56:25,761 --> 00:56:28,138
- Did you see it?
- Did it cross over? What?

975
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:30,682
There’s something in the sky.
We followed it from Culp Canyon.

976
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:32,267
I’m Bertsie. This is Gerrie.

977
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:34,037
I’m going by Gerald now.
Please call me Gerald.

978
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:35,205
I forgot. I’m sorry.
I’m Everett. This is Fay.

979
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:36,647
The power cut off at the radio...

980
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,832
You work at the radio station?

981
00:56:37,856 --> 00:56:39,316
I do Highway Hits.

982
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:41,693
- Were you listening?
- We drove 80 mph.

983
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:44,337
It was something in the sky.
He does the old stuff.
I do the hits.

984
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:46,799
No, we don’t listen to...
I don’t like new stuff,
but Gerrie does.

985
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:49,076
Oh.

986
00:56:53,622 --> 00:56:54,623
Number please.

987
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,294
Yes, Everett’s here. Would you
like to speak with him here?

988
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:01,296
Okay, I’ll connect you.

989
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,800
Everett, come to board one!
There’s a lady calling in
for the station!

990
00:57:09,304 --> 00:57:11,265
Here.

991
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:13,684
Hello. This is Everett
"the Maverick" Sloan, WOTW.

992
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:15,769
I can tell you what’s going on.

993
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:18,063
What do you mean?
I can tell you more

994
00:57:18,146 --> 00:57:20,482
about what that fellow
told you on the radio

995
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:22,901
and give you more
for your radio show.

996
00:57:22,985 --> 00:57:24,820
Okay, go ahead.
No.

997
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:27,155
I would prefer you
to come to my house.

998
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:28,907
I would like to tell you here.

999
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:30,576
There’s something
in the sky, ma’am.

1000
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:32,452
I know.

1001
00:57:32,536 --> 00:57:35,080
That’s what I want
to talk to you about.

1002
00:57:35,163 --> 00:57:37,624
I can tell you a lot more
than you know right now

1003
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:38,709
if you come here.

1004
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:43,922
I think what I can tell you
would be very important tonight.

1005
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:47,467
All right,
what’s your address?
1616 Sycamore.

1006
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:49,761
Sixteen-si... All right.
You’ll need to get a key

1007
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:52,014
from the flowerpot
on the front porch.

1008
00:57:52,097 --> 00:57:54,600
I leave it there for the boy
that brings me groceries.

1009
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:56,560
I won’t be able
to come the door.

1010
00:57:56,643 --> 00:57:59,771
I can’t walk much anymore.
But I’ll be here.

1011
00:57:59,855 --> 00:58:01,695
All right, I’ll be there
in one or two minutes.

1012
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:03,942
Uh, what’s your name?
Mabel Blanche.

1013
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:06,278
Okay, Mrs. Blanche,
we’ll see you shortly. Bye-bye.

1014
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:08,989
She said she can tell us
what’s going on. Come on.

1015
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:10,672
I told her we’d be
there in a minute.
Who?

1016
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:12,802
This old lady caller said
she can tell us
what’s going on.

1017
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:14,596
You know her?
What’s she gonna tell you?
No, I don’t.

1018
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,830
She said come immediately.
To tell you what?

1019
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:19,208
- How do you know
she’s not crazy?
- I don’t. She could be.

1020
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:21,269
But she sounded fine.
It’s one minute,
down Ayers, on Sycamore.

1021
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:23,773
- We’re gonna stay here.
- Will you find us
if you see anything?

1022
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,773
Yes. Will you find us
if you learn anything?
Yes, I will.

1023
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:27,549
Her line’s there.
You can turn the key...

1024
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:29,277
I don’t know a frog’s ribbit
about those things.

1025
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:30,802
Okay, never mind.

1026
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:40,145
What in the world, Fay?
I don’t know.
She never calls in at night.

1027
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:41,813
She’s a shut-in.
This could be news.

1028
00:58:41,897 --> 00:58:44,024
You really think so?
I really do.

1029
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:46,777
Should I have brought
my tape recorder?
No, this one’s better.

1030
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,862
Mine not good enough?
It’s...

1031
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:50,864
No, it’s fine, but it’s
not broadcast quality.

1032
00:58:50,948 --> 00:58:52,699
It’s good,
but it’s more like a toy.

1033
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:54,219
I don’t mean that in a way
to get your feelings hurt.

1034
00:58:54,243 --> 00:58:55,428
You won’t hurt my feelings.
Good.

1035
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:57,454
’Cause I hurt
girls’ feelings a lot.

1036
00:58:59,665 --> 00:59:01,226
Don’t be a jerk all the time,
probably won’t hurt...

1037
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,043
You are on the stick
with me tonight!

1038
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:18,141
Wait up.
No, you hurry up.

1039
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:27,109
Okay.

1040
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:46,920
I’m back here.

1041
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:19,203
- Who is she?
- Uh, this is Fay.

1042
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:21,006
I’m Everett.
She’s the switchboard operator.

1043
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:23,415
She’s my friend.
Is that okay?

1044
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:24,708
Yes, that’s fine.

1045
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:28,670
You can sit down.

1046
01:00:32,883 --> 01:00:35,636
- You’re the one on the phone?
- Yes.

1047
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,137
How old are you, sweetie?

1048
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:39,973
- Sixteen.
- Who are your parents?

1049
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:43,477
Oh, well, I don’t have
a dad, but, uh,
my mom is Yodi Crocker.

1050
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,605
Can I ask
what you were saying
while we were walking in?

1051
01:00:46,688 --> 01:00:48,774
That was very alarming.

1052
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:50,901
I know it was.

1053
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:53,070
I’m sorry.

1054
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:55,697
I will explain myself.

1055
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:57,824
I’m not some witch, I promise.

1056
01:00:57,908 --> 01:01:01,870
Do you mind if we tell people
what you tell us on the radio?

1057
01:01:01,954 --> 01:01:03,914
That’s why I’m telling you.

1058
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:06,458
And can we record you,
in case this is a news story?

1059
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:08,377
Of course.

1060
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,879
I hope we will be a news story.

1061
01:01:11,922 --> 01:01:15,008
I’ve been waiting
my whole life for this.

1062
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:18,846
Okay, thank you.

1063
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:21,807
Uh, also, uh,
we wanna hear everything
you have to tell us,

1064
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,684
but we have a very short
amount of time.

1065
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:26,144
- So if we have to...
- I understand.

1066
01:01:26,228 --> 01:01:27,980
Then let me get right to it.

1067
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:32,943
I listen to your broadcast,
every night.

1068
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:36,405
I think you’re very good,
and I hope you can
get far away from here.

1069
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:38,198
Thank you.

1070
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:40,534
I will tell you
what is happening,

1071
01:01:40,617 --> 01:01:43,495
but I will have
one request for you
when I have finished.

1072
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:45,289
Okay.
I’ll do whatever I can.

1073
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:48,500
The gentleman that called in...

1074
01:01:49,835 --> 01:01:51,920
I believe his stories,

1075
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:54,756
because I have
a companion story to his.

1076
01:01:55,883 --> 01:01:57,759
It started before his stories.

1077
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:01,972
They’ve come here before.

1078
01:02:02,055 --> 01:02:05,142
And now that these things
are happening more often,

1079
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:09,062
we have a better idea
of what might be out there.

1080
01:02:09,146 --> 01:02:12,191
Ever since I was a little girl,
they’ve liked this place.

1081
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:15,485
They always have.

1082
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:17,154
Who?

1083
01:02:17,237 --> 01:02:19,281
The people in the sky.

1084
01:02:22,326 --> 01:02:25,204
So you truly believe that?

1085
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:28,832
I don’t have to
truly believe it.
It’s just the truth.

1086
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:31,168
- And can you tell me why?
- Yes, I can.

1087
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,797
Have you ever heard
about the Boles Acres Raid?

1088
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:37,716
No.

1089
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:40,761
Well, when I was still little,

1090
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:43,889
they finished
the Alamogordo-El Paso
rail line.

1091
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:51,146
And one day, a passenger train
coasted to a stop outside town.

1092
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:55,234
When the deputies got there,
it was completely empty.

1093
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:57,236
Everyone assumed
the Apaches took them,

1094
01:02:57,319 --> 01:02:59,404
so they called it
the Boles Acres Raid.

1095
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:02,157
But a few days later...

1096
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:05,452
a beat-up young lady
came into town

1097
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:07,955
who had jumped off that train.

1098
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:10,624
Out in the brush... She’d been
hiding out there somewhere.

1099
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:14,211
She was dehydrated
and wouldn’t talk.

1100
01:03:16,547 --> 01:03:19,091
My friend Charlotte’s family
took her in.

1101
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:23,220
They fed her,
gave her a bed,
Charlotte’s bed actually,

1102
01:03:23,303 --> 01:03:25,848
and they telegraphed someone
in El Paso to come get her

1103
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:27,474
so they could get some answers.

1104
01:03:29,017 --> 01:03:31,186
Charlotte’s dad was
the Methodist minister.

1105
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:33,355
Batsell Breff.
He started the church here.

1106
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:38,277
My... My parents died
when I was little,

1107
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,238
so I lived
many weeks of the year

1108
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:43,198
with Charlotte’s family.

1109
01:03:43,282 --> 01:03:44,843
When my brothers
and sisters were working

1110
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:46,410
or had too many mouths to feed.

1111
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:49,580
But that night...

1112
01:03:51,957 --> 01:03:54,168
that woman from the train
started muttering

1113
01:03:54,251 --> 01:03:56,879
something in her sleep,
in Charlotte’s room.

1114
01:03:58,172 --> 01:04:00,883
It wasn’t English
or Spanish or Indian.

1115
01:04:02,342 --> 01:04:05,804
So we opened the door
a crack to listen.

1116
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:11,727
We’d never heard it before,
but I remembered it.

1117
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:15,665
And then,
before the next day,
she disappeared,

1118
01:04:15,689 --> 01:04:19,276
crawled out the window
and stole a horse,
believe it or not.

1119
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:22,196
So if you ever hear
about the old horse witch,

1120
01:04:22,279 --> 01:04:24,281
that’s where
the story came from.

1121
01:04:26,575 --> 01:04:28,327
My older sister raised me.

1122
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:31,747
But mostly I lived alone.

1123
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:34,791
I made dresses and tablecloths
and what have you.

1124
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:40,172
I was still young
when I met Claude Maynard.

1125
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:42,758
He was part of the crew
putting telephone lines in.

1126
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:46,637
We fell in love,

1127
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,391
and I conceived
my son with him
without being married.

1128
01:04:51,475 --> 01:04:54,436
I actually didn’t know that
was how you made a baby,
believe it or not.

1129
01:04:56,313 --> 01:04:58,815
He said he’d come back
when he finished work
in White Sands,

1130
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:00,484
and I believed him,

1131
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:02,152
but he never did.

1132
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:06,990
When my baby was born,
I named him Hollis.

1133
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:11,411
A few people were
kind to me, but...

1134
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:14,206
mostly I was on my own with him.

1135
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:18,335
This wasn’t a neighborhood
or a town like it is today.

1136
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:21,296
It was scattered houses
around the buildings
on Ayers.

1137
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:24,925
I was a lonely mother,
but I did my best.

1138
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:31,723
And later on, I heard Claude
had died stringing up lights

1139
01:05:31,807 --> 01:05:35,060
in a cave in Texas
for a tourist operation.

1140
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,313
Of course, that broke my heart.

1141
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:42,359
But to get back to when
Hollis was still a baby.

1142
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:49,074
One night,
after I’d nursed him,
he was asleep in my arms,

1143
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:51,410
and he started making
the sounds of an infant.

1144
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:54,246
And then they became clearer.

1145
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:56,206
More vocal.

1146
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:00,961
And then he spoke
his first words.

1147
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:04,882
And the same words
I heard come from that
confused woman at Charlotte’s

1148
01:06:04,965 --> 01:06:08,343
started coming from
the mouth of my ten-month-old
in his sleep.

1149
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:12,472
I tried to tell a few people.

1150
01:06:12,556 --> 01:06:14,308
I went to a doctor
in another town.

1151
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:17,603
He said it was baby noises
and I shouldn’t
tell anyone else.

1152
01:06:19,813 --> 01:06:21,565
Hollis always
behaved differently.

1153
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:25,819
He fixated on objects.

1154
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:28,197
He wouldn’t hear you.

1155
01:06:29,406 --> 01:06:32,159
And in his sleep,
occasionally I would hear him...

1156
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:35,370
say those words.

1157
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:38,707
So I wrote them down.

1158
01:06:40,459 --> 01:06:42,503
Word for word.

1159
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:47,508
I asked him about it,
but... he didn’t know.

1160
01:06:48,926 --> 01:06:49,927
He didn’t know.

1161
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:56,767
And one night, when he was
about four years old...

1162
01:06:58,227 --> 01:06:59,978
it got really windy outside.

1163
01:07:03,899 --> 01:07:07,945
And there was a sound,
like a really large windmill.

1164
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:12,324
And Hollis set his gaze
on the window.

1165
01:07:13,951 --> 01:07:15,160
And he wouldn’t respond.

1166
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:20,958
So I... read
the muttering to him.

1167
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:25,337
And his eyes closed
and he looked up
at the ceiling

1168
01:07:26,213 --> 01:07:28,006
and he didn’t move.

1169
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:29,842
And then his lips
moved with mine.

1170
01:07:33,053 --> 01:07:34,930
And a few moments
after I stopped...

1171
01:07:37,015 --> 01:07:38,976
he opened his eyes
and went back to playing.

1172
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:44,606
I tried it again
a few days later,
but nothing.

1173
01:07:45,941 --> 01:07:47,943
So I figured

1174
01:07:48,026 --> 01:07:50,904
there must be something
out there on those nights,

1175
01:07:50,988 --> 01:07:53,365
telling him something
that no one can hear.

1176
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:57,828
Radio was pretty new,
and that’s what
I thought it was.

1177
01:07:58,829 --> 01:08:00,914
Or something from the occult.

1178
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:05,669
And then when he was nine,

1179
01:08:05,752 --> 01:08:08,088
I got the feeling
that something
was out there again.

1180
01:08:09,756 --> 01:08:13,260
And that night,
in the middle of the night,

1181
01:08:13,343 --> 01:08:17,181
he walked out the front door
of this house and vanished.

1182
01:08:19,975 --> 01:08:21,685
How?

1183
01:08:21,768 --> 01:08:23,562
He was taken up from this Earth.

1184
01:08:24,688 --> 01:08:27,858
There were no other houses.
It was very dry.

1185
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:30,861
I followed his footprints
out the front door...

1186
01:08:31,862 --> 01:08:33,822
out to about 150 feet...

1187
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:36,950
and they stopped
there in the dirt.

1188
01:08:38,076 --> 01:08:39,953
And he wasn’t there.

1189
01:08:41,538 --> 01:08:43,165
They took my son...

1190
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,085
and no one has ever believed me.

1191
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:50,339
Was there an investigation?
Of course.

1192
01:08:50,422 --> 01:08:54,301
But the whole thing turned
to an investigation of me.

1193
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:59,431
People were convinced that
my son had ruined my life...

1194
01:09:00,557 --> 01:09:02,142
so I killed him.

1195
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:09,441
So did you recognize the sound
we played on the radio tonight?

1196
01:09:09,525 --> 01:09:11,485
No.

1197
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:14,947
But I believe I know
what is going on.

1198
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:16,490
Can you tell me what that is?

1199
01:09:17,908 --> 01:09:20,410
I believe they’re
up there tonight.

1200
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:22,579
Right now.

1201
01:09:22,663 --> 01:09:25,415
And I think
there are some reasons
to support that idea.

1202
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:27,167
Like what?

1203
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:30,295
I think they stay away
from big cities.

1204
01:09:30,379 --> 01:09:34,424
I think they wait
for people to get together
in one place, like tonight,

1205
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:36,218
and when everyone
gets out of that game,

1206
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:37,803
they’re going to be gone.

1207
01:09:39,888 --> 01:09:41,598
I think they like people alone.

1208
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:45,686
Mmm. And I think
they talk to people

1209
01:09:45,769 --> 01:09:48,272
with some kind of
advanced radio,
in their sleep.

1210
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:51,191
Right, like you think
they did with your son?

1211
01:09:51,275 --> 01:09:53,277
I didn’t just think this up.

1212
01:09:56,405 --> 01:10:00,659
I think,
at the lowest level,
they send people on errands.

1213
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:02,452
They play with people’s minds.

1214
01:10:04,621 --> 01:10:06,915
They sway people to do things

1215
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:11,253
and think certain ways
so that we stay in conflict,

1216
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:12,629
focused on ourself.

1217
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:16,175
So that we’re always

1218
01:10:16,258 --> 01:10:19,178
cleaning house or losing weight
or dressing up for other people.

1219
01:10:19,261 --> 01:10:22,431
I think they get inside
our heads and make us do
destructive things,

1220
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:24,057
like drink and overeat.

1221
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:27,936
I’ve seen good people go bad
and smart people go mad.

1222
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:32,566
I think,
at the highest level,
they do things

1223
01:10:32,649 --> 01:10:35,277
that cause nations to go to war.

1224
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,945
Things that make no sense.

1225
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:43,744
And I think no one knows
they’re being affected.

1226
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:49,333
We all work out other reasons
to justify our actions.

1227
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:54,546
But free will isn’t possible
with them up there.

1228
01:10:58,926 --> 01:11:01,470
I’ve had an entire life
to think about this.

1229
01:11:02,804 --> 01:11:03,972
Years alone.

1230
01:11:05,516 --> 01:11:06,850
And that’s what I think.

1231
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,774
Well, I’m sorry about everything
that’s happened in your life

1232
01:11:13,857 --> 01:11:15,901
to lead you to these ideas.

1233
01:11:17,569 --> 01:11:19,571
Thank you.

1234
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:21,674
Like I said in the beginning,
we don’t want to offend you,

1235
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:24,243
- but we do have to
kind of get going.
- I know.

1236
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,163
But I did have
a request for you.

1237
01:11:28,247 --> 01:11:29,248
Of course.

1238
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:32,918
I want you to take me with you.

1239
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:37,840
- Take you with us?
- Yes. Right now.

1240
01:11:37,923 --> 01:11:40,717
I’m sorry.
Uh, where do you
want us to take you?

1241
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:42,302
To the ship.

1242
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:46,139
I want to see my son.

1243
01:11:47,891 --> 01:11:50,602
I know he’s here tonight.

1244
01:11:50,686 --> 01:11:52,479
Up there.

1245
01:11:52,563 --> 01:11:55,023
And I want you to take me
to the ship.

1246
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,367
Fay, let’s go.

1247
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:07,995
- Now.
- Wait.

1248
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:18,297
Take this.

1249
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:26,138
Say this when you
encounter people tonight.

1250
01:12:45,282 --> 01:12:49,119
We’ve got to find a camera
or something. My friend
Gretchen’s dad has one.

1251
01:12:49,203 --> 01:12:52,539
Fay, I don’t think there’s
really anything up there,
not like she’s talking about.

1252
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:54,082
Everett.
What? What?

1253
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,001
I forgot about Ethel and Maddy.

1254
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:57,294
Wait. Fay, what?

1255
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:17,523
Ethel? Ethel?

1256
01:13:18,482 --> 01:13:20,108
Maddy.
Come here, come here.

1257
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:21,902
It’s okay. Sissy’s got you.

1258
01:13:21,985 --> 01:13:23,320
Come on, let’s go.

1259
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:25,113
It’s gonna be okay.
Come on.

1260
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:27,741
We’re okay. Let’s go.

1261
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:43,048
Gretchen? Gretchen, I’m gonna
need your dad’s camera.

1262
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:45,485
What’s going on?
Is everything okay?
Here, take her. I don’t know.

1263
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:47,028
Were you listening
to the radio at all?

1264
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:48,812
- Who’s at the switchboard?
- No one. I left.

1265
01:13:48,846 --> 01:13:51,557
Why are you out of breath?
Something’s going on.

1266
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,360
It might be an emergency.
I need the camera.

1267
01:13:53,392 --> 01:13:54,935
You’re gonna get me in trouble.

1268
01:13:55,018 --> 01:13:56,621
Have you heard from Ethel?
She’s not home.

1269
01:13:56,645 --> 01:13:57,997
She was babysitting
Maddy, and I called...

1270
01:13:58,021 --> 01:13:59,207
I don’t know.
I haven’t seen her.

1271
01:13:59,231 --> 01:14:01,358
I called and the line got cut.

1272
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:02,818
Fay! Damn it!

1273
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:04,444
Who’s that?
It’s Everett.

1274
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:07,865
Everett, the radio boy?
Yes. Stop smiling.

1275
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:09,700
What’s he doing here?
He’s helping me.

1276
01:14:09,783 --> 01:14:12,077
- Stop smiling.
- Goddamn, Fay!

1277
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,888
What are you doing inside?
I’m in my nightgown.

1278
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:15,348
I’m not looking, Gretchen,
and I don’t care

1279
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:16,812
what you look like
in your nightgown.

1280
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:20,669
- Okay, let’s go.
- You can’t bring her.

1281
01:14:20,752 --> 01:14:23,172
You can’t take the camera.
Go ask my dad at the game.

1282
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:24,923
There’s no time.
This is an emergency.

1283
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:27,384
What is?
What’s going on?

1284
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:31,221
There’s something in the sky.
Stay in the house.

1285
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:33,345
We don’t know that.
You can’t go
telling people that.

1286
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,767
You’re gonna start a panic.
Everybody’s at the game,

1287
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:37,996
and she sure can’t call anybody,
so stop telling me what to do

1288
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:40,647
and go find
the couple from Culp Canyon.
All right. No sweat.

1289
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:43,668
Why do you have your sister?
Ethel’s not there. She was
supposed to be babysitting.

1290
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:45,736
Well, where is she?
I don’t know.

1291
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:47,362
Is that camera gonna work?

1292
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:50,407
Yes, I can make it work.
I’ve used it before.

1293
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:52,784
Think the radio’s still down?
Oh, there’s no telling.

1294
01:15:06,215 --> 01:15:07,695
- Ethel!
- Fay, do you have Maddy?

1295
01:15:07,758 --> 01:15:09,760
Yes! Where were you?
Gabe came by...

1296
01:15:09,843 --> 01:15:11,929
God, you’re with Gabe?
What were you thinking?

1297
01:15:12,012 --> 01:15:15,307
We were on his roof.
There’s something in the sky.
Have you seen it?

1298
01:15:18,769 --> 01:15:21,021
- No. What’d you see?
- Get in! It’s outside of town!

1299
01:15:21,104 --> 01:15:23,357
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Fay, come on!

1300
01:15:25,067 --> 01:15:26,777
Come on, come on! Get in!

1301
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,321
- Stay inside the house!
- Fay, come on!

1302
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:31,740
Ethel said Gabe came over
and they got on the roof

1303
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:34,326
and saw something in the sky!
Who saw what?

1304
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:35,827
Get in.
Did you get the camera?

1305
01:15:35,911 --> 01:15:37,829
Who saw what?
My cousin Ethel...

1306
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:40,040
She was babysitting,
so they got up on the roof.

1307
01:15:40,123 --> 01:15:42,643
- They saw something in the sky.
- Where? What did it look like?

1308
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:50,968
She said it was round.

1309
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:54,096
Hiding in the clouds.

1310
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,772
What did you find out
from the old woman?

1311
01:16:05,315 --> 01:16:06,900
She said they’re up there.

1312
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:11,446
The people in the sky.

1313
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:17,202
Yeah, they have advanced radio
and communication.

1314
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:20,831
And they take people up.

1315
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,127
For real?
That’s what she said?

1316
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:26,879
Exactly.

1317
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:30,257
Matter of fact,
she read us this...

1318
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,967
Uh, hold on.

1319
01:16:37,139 --> 01:16:39,739
I’d nursed him,
he was asleep in my arms...

1320
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:49,860
when I was little,

1321
01:16:49,943 --> 01:16:53,113
so I lived...

1322
01:16:57,993 --> 01:16:59,328
I’m back here.

1323
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:30,627
Everett, stop the tape.
Stop the tape!

1324
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:33,195
Okay, okay. Gerald?

1325
01:17:33,278 --> 01:17:35,197
Gerald? Hey.

1326
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,300
- Everett, take the wheel!
I’ve got Maddy!

1327
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:39,302
Gerald, wake up, man! Gerald!

1328
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:41,370
- Gerald!
- Gerald!

1329
01:17:44,623 --> 01:17:46,708
Gerald!

1330
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:49,545
I want out! Okay?

1331
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:51,064
- Slow down!
- Hold on!

1332
01:17:51,088 --> 01:17:52,756
No!
Let me out now, please!

1333
01:17:59,388 --> 01:18:01,139
I’m so sorry.
Let me out of here!

1334
01:18:01,223 --> 01:18:02,742
- I want to go home!
- Come on. Please go!

1335
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:05,435
- Please leave us be!
- I’m so sorry.

1336
01:18:05,519 --> 01:18:07,354
Come back here
so we can take you home!

1337
01:18:07,437 --> 01:18:10,023
- There are rattlesnakes!
- Please go! Please!

1338
01:18:28,292 --> 01:18:30,210
I’m right here, Fay.
I’m right here.

1339
01:18:34,339 --> 01:18:37,050
It’s fine.

1340
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:57,446
What is it?

1341
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:01,950
It’s burnt.

1342
01:19:07,497 --> 01:19:09,208
Trees are burnt, too.

1343
01:19:38,237 --> 01:19:39,821
Oh, my gosh.

1344
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:47,454
Oh, no.

1345
01:19:52,209 --> 01:19:53,544
They’re here.

1346
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:57,422
They’re really here.

1347
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:53,520
Do you think
they’re in the forest?

1348
01:20:54,438 --> 01:20:55,856
I don’t know.

1349
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:15,292
Everett, please don’t.

1350
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:19,880
Everett.

1351
01:21:21,298 --> 01:21:23,926
Please. Don’t.
