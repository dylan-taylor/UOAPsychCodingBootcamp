1
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,383
Thirteen meters. You should see it.

2
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,717
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

3
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,238
<i>Okay,</i> Mir Two,

4
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,180
<i>we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.</i>

5
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,508
<i>Okay, quiet. We're rolling.</i>

6
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,346
<i>Seeing her coming out of the
darkness like a ghost ship</i>

7
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,681
<i>still gets me every time.</i>

8
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,644
To see the sad ruin of the
great ship sitting here

9
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,689
where she landed at 2:30 in the morning

10
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,900
of April 15, 1912

11
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,527
after her long fall

12
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,881
from the world above.

13
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,425
You are so full of shit, boss.

14
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,707
<i>Dive six. Here we are again</i>

15
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,608
<i>on the deck of</i> Titanic.

16
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:59,239
Two and a half miles down.
3,821 meters.

17
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,535
The pressure outside is three and
a half tons per square inch.

18
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,745
These windows are nine inches thick,

19
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,290
and if they go, it's <i>sayonara</i>
in two microseconds.

20
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,669
All right, enough of that bullshit.

21
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,619
Just put her down on the roof
of the officers' quarters

22
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,978
-like yesterday.
-Sure.

23
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,415
<i>Okay, Mir Two,</i>

24
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,274
<i>we're landing right over
the Grand Staircase.</i>

25
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,109
<i>You guys set to launch?</i>

26
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,778
Yeah, Brock. Launching Dunkin now.

27
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,946
Go, Charlie.

28
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,140
-Running tether out.
-Tether out.

29
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,248
Tether out.

30
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,475
<i>Okay, Brock,</i>

31
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,501
<i>we're dropping down along the hull.</i>

32
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,107
Yeah, roger that.
Okay, drop down and go

33
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,966
into the first-class gangway door.

34
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,194
I want you guys working the D deck,

00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,679
<i>reception area and the dining saloon.</i>

36
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,473

00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,914
<i>-Tether out.
-Tether out.</i>

38
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,124
<i>Now left. Now left.
Left. Left.</i>

39
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,828
Okay. Coming left.
Coming left.

40
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,594
<i>Snoop Dog is on the move.</i>

41
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,703
<i>We're headed down the stairwell.</i>

42
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,291
Okay, Lewis, drop down to B deck.

43
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:34,810
Okay, A deck?

44
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,103
Give me some rope, Captain.

45
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,188
B deck. Get in there. Get in there.

46
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,296
Okay.

47
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,604
Watch the door frame.
Watch the door frame.

48
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,468
-Watch it, watch it.
-Yeah, I see it. I got it.

49
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,862
-We're good.
-Bring her down.

50
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,046
We're good. Just chill, boss.

51
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,446
Okay. Okay, make your turn.

52
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,048
-Come around.
-Cable out, Captain.

53
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,508
Make your turn.
Watch the wall.

54
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,868
Yeah, Brock, we're at the piano.
You copy?

55
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,953
<i>Okay, copy that.</i>

56
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,546
Okay, right there. Right there.
Right there.

57
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,566
Okay, that's it, that's it.
That's the bedroom door.

58
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,008
I see it. I see it.

59
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,101
We're in!

60
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,746
We're in, baby. We're there.

61
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,565
That's Hockley's bed.

62
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,817
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

63
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,427
Oops.
Somebody left the water running.

64
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,720
Wait, hold it. Hold it. Just a second.

65
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,162
Go back to the right.

66
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,004
That wardrobe door. Get closer.

67
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,756
You smelling something, boss?

68
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,484
I want to see what's under it.

69
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,218
Give me my hands, man.

70
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,183
All right.

71
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,828
Take it easy.

72
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,978
-It might come apart.
-Okay.

73
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,441
Go, go, go. Flip it over. Flip it over. Go.

74
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,294
Turn her over. Keep going.

75
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,778
Go, go, go.

76
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,196
Okay, drop it.

77
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,542
Oh, baby, baby.
Are you seeing this, boss?

78
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,963
It's payday, boys.

79
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,939
Cha-ching!

80
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,650
-We did it, Bobby.
-We brought it back, baby.

81
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,987
Oh, yeah! Who's the best?
Who's the best, baby?

82
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,322
Say it. Say it. Say it.

83
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,324
You are, Lewis.

84
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,270
-Bobby, my cigar.
-It's right here.

85
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:06,957
Okay, crack her open.

86
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,069
Get around. Hang on.
You getting it?

87
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,094
Got it.

88
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,952
Shit.

89
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,456
No diamond.

90
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,019
You know, boss,
this same thing happened to Geraldo

91
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,170
and his career never recovered.

92
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,884
<i>Turn the camera off.</i>

93
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,970
Brock, the partners
would like to know how it's going.

94
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,241
Hey, Dave, Barry, hi.

95
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,642
Look, it wasn't in the safe.

96
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,370
But, hey, hey... Don't worry about it.

97
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,497
There's still plenty of places it could be.

98
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,605
Hell, yes.

99
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,667
The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room,

100
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,085
the purser's safe on C deck.

101
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,294
Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

102
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,420
A dozen other places.

103
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,881
Guys, look, just got to trust my instincts.

104
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,508
I know we're close.

105
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,159
We've just got to go through
a little process of elimination.

106
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,079
Hang on a second.

107
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:24,934
Let me see that.

108
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,758
Ah, we might
have something here, guys.

109
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,232
Where's the photograph of the necklace?

110
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,424
We'll call you right back.

111
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,926
Holy...

112
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,438
I'll be goddamned.

113
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,751
<i>Treasure hunter Brock Lovett</i>

115
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,237
It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.

116
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,632
Come on.

117
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,925
<i>Now he has chartered Russian subs</i>

<i>the familiar stories of</i> Titanic.

123
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:14,215
<i>You know, the nobility of the band

124
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,861
<i>But what I'm interested in
are the untold stories.</i>

125
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,113
<i>The secrets locked deep inside
the hull of</i> Titanic.

126
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,490
<i>And we're out here

<i>to go further into the wreck</i>

<i>than anybody's ever done before.</i>

<i>Your expedition

130
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,833
<i>over salvage rights and even ethics.</i>

131
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,901
<i>Many are calling you a grave robber.</i>

132
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,004
<i>Well, nobody ever called
the recovery of the artifacts...</i>

133
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,088
What is it?

134
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,156
Turn that up, dear.

135
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,260
<i>I have museum-trained experts

<i>A piece of paper that's been

<i>And my team are able to

140
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,634
<i>Should this have remained unseen

00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,737
<i>when we can see and enjoy it now?</i>

142
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,680
I'll be goddamned.

143
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,101
Brock!

144
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,353
There's a satellite call for you.

145
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,580
Bobby, we're launching.

146
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,940
You see these submersibles going
in the water?

147
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,609
Trust me, buddy.
You want to take this call.

148
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,779
This better be good.

149
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,215
-And you gotta speak up.
-Yeah, standby.

150
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,782
She's kind of old.

151
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,200
Great.

152
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,454
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs...?

153
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,707
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

154
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:29,958
Mrs. Calvert.

155
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,771
I was just wondering if you had found

156
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,047
the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett?

157
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,135
Told you you wanted to take the call.

158
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,390
All right, you have my attention, Rose.

159
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,059
Can you tell us who
the woman in the picture is?

160
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,730
Oh, yes.
The woman in the picture is me.

161
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,724
She's a goddamn liar!

162
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,334
Some nutcase
seeking money or publicity.

163
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,061
God only knows what.

164
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,421
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

165
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,173
They're inbound!

166
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,865
Rose DeWitt Bukater
died on the <i>Titanic</i>

167
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,700
when she was 17, right?

168
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,826
That's right.

169
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,329
If she had lived,
she'd be over 100 by now.

170
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,313
101 next month.

171
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,941
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

172
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,361
Look, I've already done
the background on this woman

173
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,464
all the way back to the 20s,

174
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,448
when she was working as an actress.

175
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:44,759
An actress.

176
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,618
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

177
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,138
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.

178
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,247
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

179
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,683
They move to Cedar Rapids

180
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,793
and she punches out a couple of kids.

181
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,270
Now Calvert's dead

182
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,272
and, from what I hear,
Cedar Rapids is dead.

183
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,857
And everybody who knows
about the diamond

184
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:00,983
is supposed to be dead

185
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,093
or on this boat, but she knows.

186
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,726
Copy that.

187
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,043
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

188
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,694
Hurry up, give him a hand.

189
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,255
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.

190
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,906
Welcome to the <i>Keldysh.</i>

191
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,993
Okay, let's get her inside there.

192
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,453
Hi, Miss Calvert.

193
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,789
-Hi.
-Welcome to the <i>Keldysh.</i>

194
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,833
Thanks.

195
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,293
Hey. Hey!

196
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,427
Yes?

197
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,113
Are your staterooms all right?

198
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,139
Oh, yes. Very nice.

199
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,641
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?

200
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,476
She takes care of me.

201
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,038
We met just a few minutes ago.

202
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,689
Remember, Nana? Up on deck?

203
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,041
Oh, yes.

204
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,776
There. That's nice.

205
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,547
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

206
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,715
Can I get you anything?

207
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,157
Is there anything you'd like?

208
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,826
Yes.

209
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,662
I would like to see my drawing.

210
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,405
Louis XVI wore a fabulous
stone that was

211
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,222
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown

212
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,683
which disappeared in 1792,

213
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:38,104
about the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

214
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:42,192
The theory goes that the crown
diamond was chopped, too.

215
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,962
Recut into a heart-like shape
that became known as

216
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,905
the Heart of the Ocean.

217
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,783
Today it would be worth
more than the Hope Diamond.

218
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,202
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.

219
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,537
I only wore it this once.

220
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,123
You actually think this is you, Nana?

221
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,250
It is me, dear.

222
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,252
Wasn't I a dish?

223
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,965
I tracked it down through
insurance records.

224
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,969
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

225
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,723
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

226
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,643
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

227
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,978
Nathan Hockley, that's right.

228
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,147
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

229
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,943
The claim was for a diamond necklace
his son Caledon bought his fiancée.

230
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,403
You.

231
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,406
A week before he sailed on <i>Titanic.</i>

232
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,742
And it was filed right after the sinking.

233
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,663
So the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

234
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,249
You see the date?

235
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,752
April 14, 1912.

236
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,047
Which means if your grandmother is
who she says she is,

237
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,800
she was wearing the diamond
the day the <i>Titanic</i> sank.

238
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:52,220
And that makes you my new best friend.

239
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,536
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

240
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,395
This was mine.

241
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,523
How extraordinary.

242
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:08,028
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.

243
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,365
Hmm.

244
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,286
The reflection has changed a bit.

245
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,846
Are you ready to go back to <i>Titanic?</i>

246
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,226
Okay, here we go.

247
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,039
She hits the
'berg on the starboard side, right?

248
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,791
She kind of bumps along,
punching holes like Morse code...

249
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,253
along the side, below the water line.

250
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,630
Then the forward compartments start to flood.

251
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,698
Now, as the water level rises,

252
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,760
it spills over the watertight bulkheads

253
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,578
which, unfortunately,
don't go any higher than E deck.

254
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,413
So now as the bow goes down,

255
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,142
the stern rises up, slow at first,

256
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,019
then faster and faster

257
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:08,022
until finally, she's got her whole ass
sticking up in the air.

258
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,231
And that's a big ass.

259
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,443
We're talking 20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

260
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,654
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure.

261
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,072
So, what happens?

262
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,616
She splits,
right down to the keel.

263
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,702
And the stern falls back level.

264
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,329
Then as the bow sinks,

265
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,146
it pulls the stern vertical

266
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,940
and then finally detaches.

267
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,794
Now the stern section just kind of bobs there

268
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,695
like a cork for a couple of minutes,

269
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,115
floods, and finally goes under
about 2:20 a.m.

270
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,534
Two hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

271
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,370
The bow section planes away,

272
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,140
landing about a half a mile away

273
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,417
going 20,
30 knots when it hits the ocean floor.

274
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,399
Pretty cool, huh?

275
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:55,885
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

276
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,056
Of course, the experience of it was

277
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,559
somewhat different.

278
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,061
Will you share it with us?

279
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,615
Oh.

280
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,010
I'm taking her to rest.

281
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,094
No.

282
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,429
Come on, Nana.

283
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,871
No!

284
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,627
Give me the tape recorder.

285
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:14,798
Tell us, Rose.

286
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,177
It's been 84 years...

287
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,113
It's okay.
Just try to remember anything,

288
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,681
anything at all.

289
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,643
Do you want to hear this or not, Mr. Lovett?

290
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,650
It's been 84 years,

291
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:38,488
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

292
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,118
The china had never been used.

293
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,496
The sheets had never been slept in.

294
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:52,085
<i>Titanic</i> was called the ship of dreams.

295
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,754
And it was.

296
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,716
It really was.

297
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,456
All third-class passengers

298
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:34,085
with a forward berth, this way, please!
This queue!

299
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,129
It's a big boat, huh?

300
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,340
Daddy, it's a ship.

301
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,465
You're right.

302
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,456
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

303
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,060
It doesn't look any
bigger than the <i>Mauretania.</i>

304
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:16,002
You can be blasé
about some things, Rose,

305
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,921
but not about <i>Titanic.</i>

306
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,857
It's over 100 feet
longer than <i>Mauretania,</i>

307
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,508
and far more luxurious.

308
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,803
Your daughter is far too
difficult to impress, Ruth.

309
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:28,032
So this is the ship
they say is unsinkable.

310
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,158
-It is unsinkable.
-Sir, sir.

311
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,660
God Himself could not sink this ship...

312
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:31,786
-Sir!
-What?

313
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,371
You have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

314
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,688
It's round that way, sir.

315
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,499
I put my faith in you, good sir.

316
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,732
Now kindly see my man.

317
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,043
Oh, yes sir. It's my pleasure, sir.

318
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,169
If I can do anything at all...

319
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,611
Yes, right.

320
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,839
All the trunks from that car there.

321
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,990
Twelve from here.

322
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,636
And the safe to the parlor suite,

323
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,954
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

324
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,290
Ladies,

325
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,352
we better hurry.

326
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,460
Come along.

327
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,203
-My coat?
-I have it, miss.

328
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,197
All third-class passengers

329
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,598
queue here for health inspection.

330
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,274
Welcome aboard, ma'am.
Welcome to <i>Titanic.</i>

331
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,545
<i>It was the ship of dreams</i>

332
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,029
<i>to everyone else.</i>

333
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,323
<i>To me, it was a slave ship</i>

334
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:33,639
<i>taking me back to America
in chains. Outwardly, I was everything</i>

335
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,832
<i>a well brought up girl should be.</i>

336
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,668
<i>Inside, I was screaming.</i>

337
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,412
Jack, you are <i>pazzo.</i>

338
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,979
You bet everything we have.

339
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,649
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

340
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,904
You moron.
I can't believe you bet our tickets.

341
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,158
Sven?

342
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,659
Bet.

343
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,224
All right, moment of truth.

344
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,726
Someone's life is about to change.

345
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:38,103
Fabrizio?

346
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:44,734
Olaf?

347
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:46,903
Nothing.

348
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,405
Sven?

349
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,910
Uh-oh. Two pair.

350
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,162
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

351
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,374
I'm sorry,

352
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,102
you're not gonna see your mom again

353
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:02,728
for a long time,

354
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,355
'cause we're going to America.

355
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,148
Full house, boys!

356
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,175
Yeah.

357
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:17,976
Oh!

358
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:21,938
Come on.

359
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,773
I'm going home!

360
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,194
I'm going home.

361
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,654
I go to America!

362
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,281
No, mate.

363
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:34,325
<i>Titanic</i> go to America, in 5 minutes.

364
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:36,637
Shit. Fabri. Come on.

365
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:37,787
Come on, here. Here.

366
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,000
We're riding in high style now!

367
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,544
We're a couple of regular swells.

368
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,314
We're practically goddamn royalty,

369
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:47,422
<i>ragazzo mio.</i>

370
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,632
You see? Is my <i>destino.</i>

371
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,152
Like I told you,

372
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:52,903
I go to America to be millionaire.

373
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,238
Whoa! Whoa!

374
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,181
<i>-Bastardo.</i>
-Whoo!

375
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:57,390
You are <i>pazzo.</i>

376
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,225
Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

377
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,562
Come on, I thought you were fast.

378
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:05,624
Whoa. Wait! Wait!

379
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:06,733
Hey, wait!

380
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,818
We're passengers! We're passengers!

381
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,757
Have you been
through the inspection queue?

382
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:13,841
Of course.

383
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,105
Anyway, we don't have any lice.

384
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,094
We're Americans. Both of us.

385
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,179
Right.

386
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,287
Come aboard.

387
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,102
We're the luckiest
sons of bitches in the world.

388
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:26,211
You know that?

389
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:36,513
Good-bye!

390
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:41,494
You know somebody?

391
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:43,103
Of course not. That's not the point.

392
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:44,688
Good-bye! I'll miss you!

393
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,147
Good-bye!

394
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,316
I will never forget you!

395
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:38,533
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

396
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,412
G-60.

397
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,081
G-60. G-60.

398
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:46,499
Excuse me, ma'am.

399
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,752
G-60.

400
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,755
Oh, right here.

401
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:53,340
Hey, how you doing?

402
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,467
Jack. Nice to meet you.

403
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,260
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.

404
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:58,720
How you doing?

405
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,990
Who says you get top bunk, huh?

406
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:06,102
Where's Sven?

407
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:09,915
This is your private
promenade deck, sir.

408
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,459
Would you be requiring anything?

409
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,193
-Mmm.
-Excuse me.

410
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,528
-This one?
-No.

411
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,655
It had a lot of faces on it.

412
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,949
This is the one.

413
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,471
Would you like all of them out, miss?

414
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,498
Yes. We need a little color in this room.

415
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,003
Put it in there. In the wardrobe.

416
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,215
God, not those finger paintings again.

417
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:36,945
They certainly were a waste of money.

418
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,986
The difference between
Cal's taste in art

419
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,613
and mine is that I have some.

420
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:41,888
They're fascinating.

421
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,225
Like being inside a dream or something.

422
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:46,810
There's truth but no logic.

423
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,896
-What's the artist's name?
-Something Picasso.

424
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,332
Something Picasso.

425
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,167
He won't amount to a thing.

426
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:54,526
He won't, trust me.

427
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:55,795
Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.

428
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,070
At least they were cheap.

429
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,406
Put it in the wardrobe.

430
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,678
Passengers to the upper deck,

431
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:04,845
we're boarding please.

432
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:07,431
<i>At Cherbourg,
a woman came aboard</i>

433
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,499
<i>named Margaret Brown.</i>

434
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,418
<i>We all called her Molly.</i>

435
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:15,064
<i>History would call her
the Unsinkable Molly Brown.</i>

436
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,465
Well, I wasn't about to
wait all day for you, sonny.

437
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,009
Here, you think you can manage?

438
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,176
Yes, ma'am.

439
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,737
<i>Her husband had struck gold</i>

440
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,138
<i>someplace out west.</i>

441
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:26,307
<i>And she was what Mother
called "new money."</i>

442
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:28,953
<i>By the next afternoon,</i>

443
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,771
<i>we were steaming west
from the coast of Ireland</i>

444
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:36,151
<i>with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.</i>

445
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,534
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.

446
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:46,661
Let's stretch her legs.

447
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,121
Yes, sir.

448
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:51,833
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

449
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:53,084
Very good, sir.

450
00:29:58,673 --> 00:29:59,673
All ahead full.

451
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:01,986
All ahead full!

452
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,970
Come on, lads.
Step lively!

453
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:24,491
All right! Let's stoke her right up!

454
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,034
We go full ahead!

455
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,911
Come on, put your backs into it!

456
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,544
Mummy!

457
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,676
21 knots, sir.

458
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:34,894
Hey, look, look, look!

459
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,482
See it?

460
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,821
There's another one! See him?

461
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:56,606
Look at that one! Look at him jump!

462
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,359
Whoo!

463
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,862
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

464
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,614
Very small, of course.

465
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:34,037
I'm the king of the world!

466
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,169
Yee-hah!

467
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,560
<i>She is the largest moving object</i>

468
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,229
<i>ever made by the hand of man</i>

469
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:24,796
in all history.

470
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,775
And our master shipbuilder,
Mr. Andrews here

471
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,759
designed her from the keel plates up.

472
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,988
I may have knocked her together,

473
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:34,222
but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

474
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:37,034
He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale

475
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:39,286
and so luxurious in its appointments

476
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,521
that its supremacy
would never be challenged.

477
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:43,189
And here she is.

478
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,735
-Willed into solid reality.
-Hear, hear.

479
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,446
I'll have the salmon.

480
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:54,951
You know I don't like that, Rose.

481
00:33:58,455 --> 00:33:59,789
She knows.

482
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,853
Hm. We'll both have the lamb.

483
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,355
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

484
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:09,049
Hm. You like lamb, right, sweet pea?

485
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,970
You gonna cut her meat for her
too there, Cal?

486
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:19,309
Hey, who thought of the name <i>Titanic?</i>

487
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,078
Was it you, Bruce?

488
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,645
Yes, actually.

489
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,692
I wanted to convey sheer size.
And size means stability,

490
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:31,154
luxury, and above all, strength.

491
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,491
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

492
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:37,011
His ideas about
the male preoccupation with size

493
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:39,079
might be of particular interest to you.

494
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:41,857
What's gotten into you?

495
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,416
Excuse me.

496
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,339
I do apologize.

497
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:51,675
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

498
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:53,944
Well, I may have to start minding

499
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:56,262
what she reads from
now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown?

500
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,973
Freud? Who is he? Is he a passenger?

501
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:01,494
It's a great big shaft,

502
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:03,198
goes right through the middle of the boat.

503
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:04,604
It's known as a propeller.

504
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,973
And it goes right along there
and it makes these waves.

505
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:08,900
Makes them spin.

506
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:13,881
The ship is nice, huh?

507
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:15,633
Yeah.
It's an Irish ship.

508
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:17,802
-Is English, no?
-No, it was built in Ireland.

509
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,012
Fifteen thousand Irish men built this ship.

510
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:22,247
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.

511
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:24,183
That's typical.

512
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:27,335
First-class dogs come down
here to take a shite.

513
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:30,272
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

514
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,816
Like we could forget?

515
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,027
I'm Tommy Ryan.

516
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:36,320
-Jack Dawson.
-Hello.

517
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:38,221
-Fabrizio.
-Hi.

518
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,141
Do you make any money with your drawings?

519
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,421
Ah, forget it, boyo.

520
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:56,048
You'd as like have
angels fly out of your arse

521
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,782
as get next to the likes of her.

522
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:13,715
Do you mind?

523
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:15,342
I hope you're proud of yourself.

524
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:25,143
<i>I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.</i>

525
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,813
<i>An endless parade of parties
and cotillions,</i>

526
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:31,274
<i>yachts and polo matches.</i>

527
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:36,321
<i>Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.</i>

528
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:40,950
<i>I felt like I was standing
at a great precipice</i>

529
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:45,663
<i>with no one to pull me back.
No one who cared</i>

530
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:48,583
<i>or even noticed.</i>

531
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:54,089
Really, miss.

532
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:39,694
Don't do it.

533
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:42,072
Stay back.

534
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:44,574
Don't come any closer.

535
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:46,719
Come on.

536
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:48,429
Just give me your hand.
I'll pull you back over.

537
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:50,288
No! Stay where you are.

538
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:52,082
I mean it.

539
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:54,417
I'll let go.

540
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:06,930
No, you won't.

541
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,266
What do you mean, no I won't?

542
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:13,371
Don't presume to tell me what
I will and will not do.

543
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:14,622
You don't know me.

544
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:16,773
Well, you would have done it already.

545
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,609
You're distracting me. Go away.

546
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:21,111
I can't.

547
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:22,654
I'm involved now.

548
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:24,674
You let go,

549
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:26,783
and I'm going to have to jump
in there after you.

550
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:30,120
Don't be absurd.

551
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,831
-You'll be killed.
-I'm a good swimmer.

552
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,791
The fall alone will kill you.

553
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,294
It would hurt.
I'm not saying it wouldn't.

554
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:40,022
Tell you the truth,

555
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:43,216
I'm a lot more concerned about
that water being so cold.

556
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:51,599
How cold?

557
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:55,145
Freezing.
Maybe a couple degrees over.

558
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:00,650
You ever, uh,

559
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:02,736
ever been to Wisconsin?

560
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,157
What?

561
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:09,826
Well, they have some of
the coldest winters around.

562
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,829
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

563
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,932
I remember when I was a kid,

564
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:17,059
me and my father, we went ice fishing

565
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,002
out on Lake Wissota.

566
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:21,188
Ice fishing is, you know, where you...

567
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:22,756
I know what ice fishing is!

568
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,175
Sorry.

569
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:30,013
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

570
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:33,350
Anyway, I...

571
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:36,353
I fell through some thin ice.

572
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:38,188
And I'm telling you

573
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:41,191
water that cold,

574
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,193
like right down there,

575
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:45,838
it hits you like 1,000 knives

576
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:47,447
stabbing you all over your body.

577
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:50,158
You can't breathe.

578
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:52,535
You can't think.

579
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,663
Least not about anything but the pain.

580
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,102
Which is why I'm not looking forward

581
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:01,961
to jumping in there after you.

582
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:04,047
Like I said...

583
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:07,550
I don't have a choice.

584
00:41:11,888 --> 00:41:12,948
I guess I'm kind of hoping

585
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:14,533
you'll come back over the rail

586
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:16,059
and get me off the hook here.

587
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:18,228
You're crazy.

588
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:21,731
That's what everybody says

589
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:24,877
but with all due respect, miss,

590
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:27,737
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

591
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:29,906
Come on.

592
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:32,242
Come on, give me your hand.

593
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,411
You don't want to do this.

594
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:49,384
Phew.

595
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:51,928
I'm Jack Dawson.

596
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,098
Rose DeWitt Bukater.

597
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,201
I'll have to get you to write that one down.

598
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:00,770
Come on.

599
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,985
I got you.

600
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:08,570
Come on.

601
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,280
Come on.

602
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:16,077
Help, please!

603
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:17,954
Help!

604
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:20,457
Please, help me!

605
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:22,268
Listen. Listen to me.

606
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:23,960
I've got you. I won't let go.

607
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:26,439
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

608
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,067
Come on.

609
00:42:30,091 --> 00:42:31,593
That's right.

610
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:33,219
You can do it.

611
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:39,476
I got you.

612
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:46,649
What's all this?

613
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:53,632
You stand back

614
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:54,949
and don't move an inch!

615
00:42:57,577 --> 00:42:59,120
Fetch the Master at Arms.

616
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:00,330
Care for a brandy?

617
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:03,059
This is completely unacceptable!

618
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,477
What made you think

619
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,221
that you could put your hands
on my fiancée?

620
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:09,982
-Look at me, you filth!
-Cal.

621
00:43:10,006 --> 00:43:11,609
What do you think you were doing?

622
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:14,177
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

623
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:16,513
An accident?

624
00:43:16,846 --> 00:43:18,181
It was.

625
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:20,517
Stupid, really.

626
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:23,687
I was leaning over and I slipped.

627
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:29,377
I was leaning far over to see the, uh,

628
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:32,612
uh, uh, the uh...

629
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:35,758
-Propellers?
-Propellers, and I slipped.

630
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:37,134
And I would have gone overboard

631
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:39,929
but Mr. Dawson here saved me.

632
00:43:39,953 --> 00:43:42,038
And almost went over himself.

633
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:44,183
You wanted to see the...
She wanted to see the propellers.

634
00:43:44,207 --> 00:43:47,669
Like I said, women and
machinery do not mix.

635
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:49,963
Was that the way of it?

636
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:55,027
Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty much it.

637
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:56,737
Well, the boy's a hero then.

638
00:43:56,761 --> 00:43:58,864
Good for you, son. Well done.

639
00:43:58,888 --> 00:44:01,975
So, it's all's well and back
to our brandy, eh?

640
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:05,204
Look at you.
You must be freezing.

641
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:06,438
Let's get you inside.

642
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:10,066
Perhaps a little something for the boy?

643
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:13,587
Of course.

644
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:16,656
Mr. Lovejoy, I think a 20 should do it.

645
00:44:17,907 --> 00:44:20,744
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

646
00:44:22,245 --> 00:44:24,080
Rose is displeased.

647
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:26,249
What to do?

648
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:27,709
I know.

649
00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:33,899
Perhaps you could join us for
dinner tomorrow evening

650
00:44:33,923 --> 00:44:35,526
to regale our group

651
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:37,802
with your heroic tale.

652
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:42,599
Sure. Count me in.

653
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:45,101
Good. It's settled then.

654
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:47,437
This should be interesting.

655
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,449
Can I bum a smoke?

656
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:09,584
You'll want to tie those.

657
00:45:12,128 --> 00:45:13,522
It's interesting...

658
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:15,399
The young lady slipped so suddenly

659
00:45:15,423 --> 00:45:17,652
and you still had time to remove your jacket

660
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:19,135
and your shoes.

661
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:37,320
I know you've been melancholy.

662
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:40,323
I don't pretend to know why.

663
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:45,161
I intended to save this

664
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:50,333
until the engagement gala next week

665
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:54,004
but, I thought

666
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:55,672
tonight.

667
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:58,341
Good gracious.

668
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:02,012
Perhaps as a reminder of my feelings for you.

669
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,139
-Is it a--
-Diamond. Yes.

670
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:09,519
56 carats to be exact.

671
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:14,190
It was worn by Louis XVI.

672
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:17,360
And they called it, <i>"Le Coeur de la Mer."</i>

673
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:19,130
-"The Heart of the Ocean."
-"The Heart of the Ocean."

674
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:20,238
Yes.

675
00:46:26,202 --> 00:46:27,871
It's overwhelming.

676
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:29,998
Well, it's for royalty.

677
00:46:31,207 --> 00:46:33,376
We are royalty, Rose.

678
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,716
You know, there's nothing
I couldn't give you.

679
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,552
There's nothing I'd deny you

680
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:45,388
if you would not deny me.

681
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:51,603
Open your heart to me, Rose.

682
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,596
Well, I've been on my own

683
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,289
since I was 15, since my folks died.

684
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:15,186
And I had no brothers or sisters or close kin

685
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,419
in that part of the country,

686
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:19,774
so I lit on out of there
and I haven't been back since.

687
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:22,485
You could just call me
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

688
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:29,450
Well, Rose, we've walked
about a mile around this boat deck

689
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:31,410
and chewed over
how great the weather's been

690
00:47:31,434 --> 00:47:33,454
and how I grew up,

691
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:36,439
but I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

692
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:40,443
-Mr. Dawson, I...
-Jack.

693
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:42,487
Jack.

694
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:46,509
I want to thank you for what you did.

695
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:51,287
Not just for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

696
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:52,956
You're welcome.

697
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:54,457
Look.

698
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:58,211
I know what you must be thinking.

699
00:47:58,461 --> 00:48:00,088
Poor little rich girl.

700
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,382
What does she know about misery?

701
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:03,633
No.

702
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:06,803
No, that's not what I was thinking.

703
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:08,388
What I was thinking was

704
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:11,808
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

705
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:15,895
Well I...

706
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:19,816
It was everything.
It was my whole world

707
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:21,877
and all the people in it.

708
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:25,572
And the inertia of my life,
plunging ahead, and me,

709
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,615
powerless to stop it.

710
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:29,826
God, look at that thing.

711
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:32,287
You would have gone straight to the bottom.

712
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:36,499
Five hundred invitations have gone out.

713
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:39,502
All of Philadelphia society will be there.

714
00:48:39,794 --> 00:48:41,796
And all the while, I feel I'm

715
00:48:42,172 --> 00:48:44,066
standing in the middle of a crowded room

716
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,842
screaming at the top of my lungs

717
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:47,427
and no one even looks up.

718
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:50,013
Do you love him?

719
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:52,349
Pardon me?

720
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:54,142
Do you love him?

721
00:48:54,684 --> 00:48:56,370
You're being very rude.

722
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:57,687
You shouldn't be asking me this.

723
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:00,690
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

724
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:05,296
This is not a suitable conversation.

725
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,880
Why can't you just answer the question?

726
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:11,326
This is absurd.

727
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:13,137
You don't know me
and I don't know you,

728
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:15,598
and we are not having
this conversation at all.

729
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:18,100
You are rude and uncouth
and presumptuous

730
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:20,144
and I am leaving now,

731
00:49:20,168 --> 00:49:23,046
Jack. Mr. Dawson.
It's been a pleasure.

732
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:25,358
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you.

733
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:27,175
And you've insulted me.

734
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:29,010
Well, you deserved it.

735
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:30,387
-Right.
-Right.

736
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,016
I thought you were leaving.

737
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:36,559
I am.

738
00:49:38,728 --> 00:49:40,206
You are so annoying.

739
00:49:41,564 --> 00:49:43,918
Wait. I don't have to leave.

740
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:47,070
This is my part of the ship.
You leave.

741
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:50,407
Oh-ho-ho-ho. Well, well, well.
Now who's being rude?

742
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:57,080
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

743
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:00,583
So, what are you,
an artist or something?

744
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:03,294
Well...

745
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:06,589
These are rather good.

746
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:13,096
They're very good, actually.

747
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:22,105
Jack, this is exquisite work.

748
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:25,108
Ah, they didn't think too
much of them in old Paris.

749
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:26,609
Paris?

750
00:50:27,902 --> 00:50:30,572
You do get around for a p...

751
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:35,428
Well, a person of limited means.

752
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:37,996
Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.

753
00:50:41,624 --> 00:50:43,293
Well, well, well.

754
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,382
And these were drawn from life?

755
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:54,947
Well, that's one of the
good things about Paris.

756
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:57,011
Lots of girls are willing
to take their clothes off.

757
00:51:03,271 --> 00:51:04,856
You liked this woman.

758
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:07,650
You used her several times.

759
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:09,819
Well.

760
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,489
She had beautiful hands, you see?

761
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:17,178
I think you must have
had a love affair with her.

762
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:19,829
No, no, no. Just with her hands.

763
00:51:20,163 --> 00:51:22,832
She was a one-legged prostitute.

764
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:24,959
See?

765
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:28,505
Oh.

766
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:33,635
She had a good sense of humor, though.

767
00:51:36,012 --> 00:51:37,180
Oh, and this lady...

768
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:41,327
She used to sit at this bar
every night

769
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:43,687
wearing every piece
of jewelry she owned,

770
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:46,272
just waiting for her long, lost love.

771
00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:49,359
We called her Madame Bijoux.

772
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:51,695
See how her clothes are all moth eaten?

773
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:56,199
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

774
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:57,867
You do.

775
00:51:58,201 --> 00:51:59,703
You see people.

776
00:51:59,994 --> 00:52:01,538
I see you.

777
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:05,291
And?

778
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:08,378
You wouldn't have jumped.

779
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:16,344
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

780
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,221
Rose has already done that.

781
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:21,391
Look, here comes
that vulgar Brown woman.

782
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:24,394
Quickly, get up before she sits with us.

783
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:28,023
Hello, girls.
I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

784
00:52:28,231 --> 00:52:29,733
We're awfully sorry, you missed it.

785
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:32,211
The Countess and I
were just off to take the air

786
00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:33,319
on the boat deck.

787
00:52:33,528 --> 00:52:34,547
What a lovely idea.

788
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:36,573
I need to catch up on my gossip.

789
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:41,244
Countess.

790
00:52:42,746 --> 00:52:45,582
So, you've not yet lit the last four boilers?

791
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:47,935
No, I don't see the need.

792
00:52:47,959 --> 00:52:49,669
We are making excellent time.

793
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,065
The press knows the size of <i>Titanic.</i>

794
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:55,258
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

795
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,761
We must give them something new to print.

796
00:52:59,804 --> 00:53:03,850
This maiden voyage of <i>Titanic</i>
must make headlines.

797
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,289
Mr. Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines

798
00:53:08,313 --> 00:53:10,940
until they've been properly run in.

799
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:13,502
Of course I'm just a passenger.

800
00:53:13,526 --> 00:53:16,029
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

801
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:19,282
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing

802
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:21,052
if we were to get
into New York on Tuesday night

803
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:23,787
and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.

804
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:26,706
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

805
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:31,628
Good man.

806
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:33,439
Well, after that,

807
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:35,215
I worked on a squid boat in Monterey,

808
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:37,652
then I went down to Los Angeles

809
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:38,885
to the pier in Santa Monica

810
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:40,154
and started doing portraits there

811
00:53:40,178 --> 00:53:41,471
for 10 cents apiece.

812
00:53:42,972 --> 00:53:44,474
Why can't I be like you, Jack?

813
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,977
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

814
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:52,565
Say we'll go there sometime,
to that pier,

815
00:53:53,441 --> 00:53:55,694
even if we only ever just talk about it.

816
00:53:56,152 --> 00:53:57,404
No, we'll do it.

817
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:58,780
We'll drink cheap beer.

818
00:53:59,322 --> 00:54:01,282
We'll ride on the roller coaster
till we throw up.

819
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,953
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,
right in the surf.

820
00:54:05,745 --> 00:54:07,515
Now, but you'll have to do it
like a real cowboy.

821
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:08,957
None of that sidesaddle stuff.

822
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:12,168
You mean one leg on each side?

823
00:54:12,335 --> 00:54:13,336
Yeah.

824
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:15,255
Can you show me?

825
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:17,340
Sure, if you like.

826
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:20,468
Teach me to ride like a man.

827
00:54:20,635 --> 00:54:22,595
And chew tobacco like a man.

828
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:25,932
And spit like a man.

829
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,952
What, they didn't teach you
that in finishing school?

830
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:28,977
No.

831
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,563
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.

832
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:33,606
-What?
-I'll show you how. Come on.

833
00:54:33,773 --> 00:54:36,359
-Jack, no! Jack, no!
-Oh, come on! Come on.

834
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:37,944
-Wait, Jack!
-Come on.

835
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:39,296
-No, Jack...
-Come on!

836
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,381
I couldn't possibly, Jack.

837
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:41,489
Watch closely.

838
00:54:44,117 --> 00:54:45,493
That's disgusting!

839
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:46,703
All right, your turn.

840
00:54:49,205 --> 00:54:50,206
That was pitiful.

841
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:52,310
Come on, you really gotta hawk
it back, you know.

842
00:54:52,334 --> 00:54:53,936
Get some leverage to it.
Use your arms.

843
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,045
Arc your neck.

844
00:54:56,838 --> 00:54:57,857
Now, you see the range on that thing?

845
00:54:57,881 --> 00:54:58,965
Mm-hmm.

846
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:00,675
Okay, go.

847
00:55:04,387 --> 00:55:05,364
Oh, that was better.

848
00:55:05,388 --> 00:55:06,588
-You gotta work on it.
-Really?

849
00:55:06,681 --> 00:55:07,658
Really try to hawk it up

850
00:55:07,682 --> 00:55:09,522
and get some body to it, you know?
You gotta...

851
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,360
Mother.

852
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,575
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

853
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:28,620
Charmed, I'm sure.

854
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:36,395
<i>The others were
gracious and curious</i>

855
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:38,672
<i>about the man who'd saved my life.</i>

856
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:42,842
<i>But my mother looked at him
like an insect.</i>

857
00:55:43,176 --> 00:55:45,095
<i>A dangerous insect</i>

858
00:55:45,261 --> 00:55:47,055
<i>which must be squashed quickly.</i>

859
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:50,892
Well, Jack, sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

860
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:56,707
Why do they always insist
on announcing dinner

861
00:55:56,731 --> 00:55:58,066
like a damn cavalry charge?

862
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:00,568
Shall we go dress, Mother?

863
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:03,279
See you at dinner, Jack.

864
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:06,950
Uh, son?

865
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:08,535
Son!

866
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:10,429
Do you have the slightest comprehension

867
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:11,538
what you're doing?

868
00:56:12,497 --> 00:56:13,498
Not really.

869
00:56:13,915 --> 00:56:15,792
Well, you're about to go into the snake pit.

870
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:20,380
What are you planning to wear?

871
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:24,968
I figured. Come on.

872
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:29,514
I was right.

873
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:32,684
You and my son
are just about the same size.

874
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:33,977
Pretty close.

875
00:56:38,314 --> 00:56:39,983
You shine up like a new penny.

876
00:56:52,537 --> 00:56:53,538
Good evening, sir.

877
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,181
Hello.

878
00:57:58,144 --> 00:57:59,455
Do you know that there
are several thousand tons

879
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:01,064
of Hockley steel in this very ship?

880
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:02,416
Which part?

881
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,751
All the right ones, of course.

882
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:05,044
Then we'll know who to hold accountable

883
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:06,736
if there's a problem.
Where's my daughter?

884
00:58:06,903 --> 00:58:07,904
Oh, she'll be along.

885
00:58:08,446 --> 00:58:10,198
There is the Countess.

886
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:12,099
-Hello, my dear.
-Good evening, Cal.

887
00:58:12,492 --> 00:58:13,493
It's so good to see you.

888
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:41,414
I saw that in a nickelodeon once

889
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:43,189
and I always wanted to do it.

890
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:56,862
I'll see you at dinner.

891
00:58:57,746 --> 00:59:00,957
Darling, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

892
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:03,084
Dawson.

893
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:05,879
Well, that's amazing.

894
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:07,922
You could almost pass for a gentleman.

895
00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:10,342
Almost.

896
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:11,551
That's extraordinary.

897
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:25,416
My dear, it's delightful to see you.

898
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,524
Cosmo.

899
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:27,752
What a remarkable voyage this is.

900
00:59:27,776 --> 00:59:28,860
It's mad, isn't it?

901
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:30,070
How lovely.

902
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:33,198
There's the Countess of Rothes.

903
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:38,578
And that's John Jacob Astor,

904
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:41,206
the richest man on the ship.

905
00:59:41,373 --> 00:59:44,668
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

906
00:59:46,252 --> 00:59:47,587
See how she's trying to hide it.

907
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:49,339
-Quite the scandal.
-Hmm.

908
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:51,817
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim

909
00:59:51,841 --> 00:59:53,510
and his mistress, Madame Aubert.

910
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:56,471
Mrs. Guggenheim
is at home with the children, of course.

911
00:59:57,347 --> 00:59:58,908
And over here we have Sir Cosmo

912
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:00,517
and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

913
01:00:00,892 --> 01:00:04,104
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

914
01:00:04,729 --> 01:00:06,481
Very popular with the royals.

915
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:09,776
Congratulations, Hockley.
She's splendid.

916
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:11,236
Why, thank you.

917
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:13,863
Care to escort a lady to dinner?

918
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,657
Certainly.

919
01:00:16,282 --> 01:00:18,284
Sweet pea, sweet pea.

920
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:21,268
Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack?

921
01:00:21,871 --> 01:00:23,140
Remember, they love money

922
01:00:23,164 --> 01:00:24,804
so just pretend like you own a gold mine,

923
01:00:24,874 --> 01:00:25,917
and you're in the club.

924
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:29,713
Hey, Astor.

925
01:00:31,172 --> 01:00:32,173
Well, hello, Molly.

926
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:33,967
Nice to see you.

927
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:36,344
J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you
to meet Jack Dawson.

928
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,929
-How do you do?
-Pleasure.

929
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:39,431
Hello, Jack.

930
01:00:40,265 --> 01:00:41,766
Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

931
01:00:42,934 --> 01:00:45,270
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

932
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:46,438
Oh, yes.

933
01:00:49,065 --> 01:00:52,402
<i>He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.</i>

934
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:55,697
<i>They assumed he was one of them.</i>

935
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:59,034
<i>Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.</i>

936
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:01,387
<i>New money, obviously,</i>

937
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:03,329
<i>but still a member of the club.</i>

938
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:08,084
<i>Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.</i>

939
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:11,796
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.

940
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:13,590
I hear they're quite good on this ship.

941
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:18,261
The best I've seen, ma'am.
Hardly any rats.

942
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:23,516
Mr. Dawson is joining us from the third class.

943
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,351
He was of some assistance
to my fiancée last night.

944
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:29,606
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

945
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:32,103
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

946
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:35,445
Rose and I differ somewhat in our
definition of fine art.

947
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:38,114
Not to impugn your work, sir.

948
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:46,932
She may be mine on paper,
in the eyes of God,

949
01:01:46,956 --> 01:01:48,583
she belongs to Thomas Adlers.

950
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:49,834
Are these all for me?

951
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:51,921
Just start from the outside
and work your way in.

952
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:54,255
He knows every rivet in her,
don't you, Thomas?

953
01:01:54,422 --> 01:01:55,483
-Indeed.
-Your ship

954
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:57,092
is a wonder, Mr. Andrews, truly.

955
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,635
Thank you, Rose.

956
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,306
How do you take your caviar, sir?

957
01:02:03,515 --> 01:02:06,893
No caviar for me, thanks.
Never did like it much.

958
01:02:08,853 --> 01:02:11,356
And where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?

959
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:14,734
Well, right now,
my address is the RMS <i>Titanic.</i>

960
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:17,070
After that,
I'm on God's good humor.

961
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:19,489
And how is it you have means to travel?

962
01:02:20,448 --> 01:02:22,367
I work my way from place to place.

963
01:02:22,575 --> 01:02:24,911
You know, tramp steamers and such.

964
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:28,039
But I won my ticket on <i>Titanic</i>
here at a lucky hand at poker.

965
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:29,874
A very lucky hand.

966
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,211
All life is a game of luck.

967
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:37,340
A real man makes his own luck, Archie.
Right, Dawson?

968
01:02:37,757 --> 01:02:38,734
Mmm.

969
01:02:38,758 --> 01:02:40,903
And you find that sort of
rootless existence

970
01:02:40,927 --> 01:02:42,303
appealing, do you?

971
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,517
Well, yes, ma'am, I do.

972
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:51,312
I mean, I've got everything
I need right here with me.

973
01:02:51,479 --> 01:02:52,540
Got air in my lungs

974
01:02:52,564 --> 01:02:54,315
and a few blank sheets of paper.

975
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:57,044
I mean, I love waking up in the morning,

976
01:02:57,068 --> 01:02:58,361
not knowing what's gonna happen

977
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:00,196
or who I'm gonna meet.

978
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:02,490
Where I'm gonna wind up.

979
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:04,010
Just the other night

980
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:05,511
I was sleeping
under a bridge, and now

981
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:07,596
here I am on the grandest ship in the world,

982
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,539
having champagne with you fine people.

983
01:03:09,914 --> 01:03:10,915
I'll take some of that.

984
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:13,352
I figure life's a gift,

985
01:03:13,376 --> 01:03:14,711
and I don't intend on wasting it.

986
01:03:16,629 --> 01:03:18,709
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

987
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:20,860
You learn to take life as it comes at you.

988
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:22,135
Oh, here you go, Cal.

989
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:26,389
To make each day count.

990
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:28,183
Well said, Jack.

991
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,559
Hear, hear.

992
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:31,770
To making it count.

993
01:03:33,646 --> 01:03:34,647
To making it count.

994
01:03:35,815 --> 01:03:36,816
Bravo.

995
01:03:43,865 --> 01:03:45,426
But Mr. Brown had no idea

996
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:46,910
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

997
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:50,973
So, he comes home
drunk as a pig celebrating

998
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:52,266
and he lights a fire.

999
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,461
Bravo.

1000
01:03:56,628 --> 01:03:58,672
Next it'll be brandies in the smoking room.

1001
01:03:59,714 --> 01:04:02,759
Well, join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

1002
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:04,552
-What a good idea!
-Yes.

1003
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:06,530
Now they'll retreat into a cloud of smoke

1004
01:04:06,554 --> 01:04:07,573
and congratulate each other

1005
01:04:07,597 --> 01:04:09,140
on being masters of the universe.

1006
01:04:09,307 --> 01:04:10,284
Ladies, thank you

1007
01:04:10,308 --> 01:04:11,628
for the pleasure of your company.

1008
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:14,242
Rose, may I escort you back to the cabin?

1009
01:04:14,312 --> 01:04:15,397
No, I'll stay here.

1010
01:04:16,147 --> 01:04:17,148
Here you go, Molly.

1011
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:19,925
Joining us, Dawson?

1012
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:21,796
Well, you don't want to stay out here

1013
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:23,180
with the women, do you?

1014
01:04:23,613 --> 01:04:25,132
No, thanks.
I've gotta be heading back.

1015
01:04:25,156 --> 01:04:26,217
Ah.

1016
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:27,325
Probably best.

1017
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:28,511
It'll be all business and politics,

1018
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:29,679
that sort of thing.

1019
01:04:29,703 --> 01:04:30,870
Wouldn't interest you.

1020
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:34,582
But, Dawson, good of you to come.

1021
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,506
Jack, must you go?

1022
01:04:41,715 --> 01:04:44,092
Time for me to go row with
the other slaves.

1023
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:48,471
Good night, Rose.

1024
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,805
So, you wanna go to a real party?

1025
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:44,361
Is okay if put my hand here? Okay.

1026
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:00,877
What?

1027
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:05,237
I can't understand you.

1028
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:33,743
Bravo!

1029
01:06:35,995 --> 01:06:36,996
Let's go!

1030
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:39,639
I'm gonna dance with her now, all right?

1031
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:41,584
Come on.

1032
01:06:42,168 --> 01:06:43,169
-What?
-Come on.

1033
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:46,297
-Come with me.
-What? Jack. Jack, wait.

1034
01:06:48,675 --> 01:06:49,676
I can't do this.

1035
01:06:49,884 --> 01:06:51,644
We're gonna have to get a little bit closer.

1036
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:52,846
Like this.

1037
01:06:56,599 --> 01:06:58,143
You're still my best girl, Cora.

1038
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:02,564
I don't know the steps.

1039
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:03,931
Neither do I. Just go with it.

1040
01:07:04,899 --> 01:07:05,984
Don't think.

1041
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:27,630
Wait! Jack, Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!

1042
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:34,219
Bom, bom, bom.

1043
01:07:37,766 --> 01:07:38,850
Jack, what? Wait!

1044
01:08:08,963 --> 01:08:10,090
Whoo-hoo!

1045
01:08:17,347 --> 01:08:19,349
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

1046
01:08:19,724 --> 01:08:20,725
Yeah!

1047
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,644
Jack, no!

1048
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:24,938
Wow!

1049
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:29,943
Beyond the jurisdiction of the Sherman Act.

1050
01:08:30,485 --> 01:08:31,805
That's how my lawyers will argue.

1051
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,422
That's what Rockefeller said,

1052
01:08:33,446 --> 01:08:35,407
but the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.

1053
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:57,095
What?

1054
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:59,347
You think a first-class girl can't drink?

1055
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:02,034
Oh!

1056
01:09:02,058 --> 01:09:03,143
Hey, get out of here.

1057
01:09:03,893 --> 01:09:04,894
You all right?

1058
01:09:07,355 --> 01:09:08,356
I'm fine.

1059
01:09:08,565 --> 01:09:09,917
Two out of three. Two out of three.

1060
01:09:09,941 --> 01:09:11,381
Yeah, you the man.
You the man-beast!

1061
01:09:11,484 --> 01:09:12,485
So...

1062
01:09:13,945 --> 01:09:15,280
you think you're big, tough men?

1063
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,658
Let's see you do this.

1064
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:22,954
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

1065
01:09:37,844 --> 01:09:39,346
-Ow!
-Whoa!

1066
01:09:41,306 --> 01:09:43,391
-Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!
-You all right?

1067
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:45,643
I haven't done that in years.

1068
01:09:53,651 --> 01:09:54,920
Go see Maggie, lads.
Give her the holley!

1069
01:09:54,944 --> 01:09:56,130
Let's go.

1070
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:00,742
Oh, here. Come on.

1071
01:10:22,347 --> 01:10:23,348
Coffee, sir?

1072
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:35,662
I had hoped you would come
to me last night.

1073
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:38,822
I was tired.

1074
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:44,411
Your exertions below decks
were no doubt exhausting.

1075
01:10:47,622 --> 01:10:49,433
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant

1076
01:10:49,457 --> 01:10:50,542
follow me, how typical.

1077
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:53,145
You will never behave like that again, Rose.

1078
01:10:53,169 --> 01:10:54,295
Do you understand?

1079
01:10:57,966 --> 01:10:59,276
I'm not a foreman in one of your mills

1080
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,385
that you can command.

1081
01:11:02,554 --> 01:11:04,097
I'm your fiancée.

1082
01:11:05,557 --> 01:11:08,268
-My fiancée.
-My fiancée!

1083
01:11:08,685 --> 01:11:10,145
Yes, you are! And my wife!

1084
01:11:11,312 --> 01:11:13,708
My wife in practice, if not yet by law,

1085
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:15,567
so you will honor me!

1086
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:17,169
You will honor me the way a wife

1087
01:11:17,193 --> 01:11:18,611
is required to honor a husband.

1088
01:11:19,195 --> 01:11:21,114
Because I will not
be made out a fool, Rose.

1089
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:23,575
Is this in any way unclear?

1090
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:26,286
No.

1091
01:11:26,494 --> 01:11:27,495
Good.

1092
01:11:27,954 --> 01:11:29,205
Excuse me.

1093
01:11:34,502 --> 01:11:35,712
Oh, Miss Rose.

1094
01:11:37,714 --> 01:11:38,691
We had a little accident.

1095
01:11:38,715 --> 01:11:40,067
It's all right, Miss Rose. It's all right.

1096
01:11:40,091 --> 01:11:42,093
-I'm sorry, Trudy.
-It's all right.

1097
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,303
Let me help you.

1098
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:44,679
It's all right, Miss.

1099
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:53,229
It's all right, Miss.

1100
01:11:58,860 --> 01:11:59,861
Tea, Trudy.

1101
01:12:00,737 --> 01:12:01,738
Yes, ma'am.

1102
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:19,065
You're not to see that boy again.

1103
01:12:19,089 --> 01:12:20,173
Do you understand me?

1104
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,469
Rose, I forbid it.

1105
01:12:25,595 --> 01:12:26,781
Oh, stop it, Mother.

1106
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:28,181
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

1107
01:12:29,015 --> 01:12:30,016
This is not a game.

1108
01:12:31,142 --> 01:12:34,688
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

1109
01:12:34,896 --> 01:12:36,189
Of course, I know it's gone.

1110
01:12:37,565 --> 01:12:38,817
You remind me every day.

1111
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,088
Your father left us nothing

1112
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:45,281
but a legacy of bad debts hidden
by a good name.

1113
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:48,201
That name is the only card
we have to play.

1114
01:12:48,868 --> 01:12:50,036
I don't understand you.

1115
01:12:51,204 --> 01:12:52,723
It is a fine match with Hockley.

1116
01:12:52,747 --> 01:12:54,541
It will ensure our survival.

1117
01:12:56,584 --> 01:12:58,169
How can you put this on my shoulders?

1118
01:12:58,378 --> 01:12:59,963
Why are you being so selfish?

1119
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,589
I'm being selfish?

1120
01:13:05,885 --> 01:13:08,054
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?

1121
01:13:10,598 --> 01:13:11,725
Is that what you want?

1122
01:13:15,061 --> 01:13:17,272
To see our fine things sold at auction?

1123
01:13:19,524 --> 01:13:21,484
Our memories scattered to the winds?

1124
01:13:32,537 --> 01:13:33,663
It's so unfair.

1125
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:36,833
Of course it's unfair.

1126
01:13:38,752 --> 01:13:39,794
We're women.

1127
01:13:42,505 --> 01:13:44,215
Our choices are never easy.

1128
01:13:51,639 --> 01:13:52,682
Mmm?

I just need to talk to somebody for a sec.

1141
01:14:56,496 --> 01:14:57,473
You're not supposed to be in here.

1142
01:14:57,497 --> 01:14:58,790
Just need to speak to someone.

1143
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:01,876

1145
01:15:03,545 --> 01:15:05,064
I was just here last night.
You don't remember me?

1146
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:06,089
No, I'm afraid I don't.

1147
01:15:06,256 --> 01:15:07,233
Now you're gonna have to turn around.

1148
01:15:07,257 --> 01:15:08,425
He'll tell you.

1149
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:10,444
I just need to talk to...

1150
01:15:10,468 --> 01:15:13,388
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater

1151
01:15:14,055 --> 01:15:16,224
continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.

1152
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:20,603
They asked me
to give you this in gratitude.

1153
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:22,450
I don't want your money, please, I just...

1154
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:24,000
And also to remind you

1155
01:15:24,024 --> 01:15:25,942
that you hold a third-class ticket

1156
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:28,611
and that your presence here is
no longer appropriate.

1157
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,298
Please, I just wanna speak to Rose
for one second, all right? Please!

1158
01:15:31,322 --> 01:15:34,617
Gentlemen, please see that Mr. Dawson
gets back to where he belongs

1159
01:15:34,826 --> 01:15:35,827
and that he stays there?

1160
01:15:37,454 --> 01:15:39,372
Yes, sir. Come along, you.

01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:44,878
<i>♪ O hear us when we cry to Thee ♪</i>

1162

1163
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:52,802
And why do you have
two steering wheels?

1164
01:15:52,969 --> 01:15:54,369
We really only use this near shore.

1165
01:15:54,512 --> 01:15:56,931
Excuse me, sir. Another ice warning.

1166
01:15:57,098 --> 01:15:58,391
This one's from the <i>Noordam.</i>

1167
01:15:58,558 --> 01:15:59,798
Thank you, Sparks.

1168
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:05,648
Oh, not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

1169
01:16:06,524 --> 01:16:08,044
In fact, we're speeding up.

1170
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:09,986
I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

1171
01:16:14,366 --> 01:16:17,327
Okay, son, wind it up tight like
I showed you. That's right.

1172
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:18,495
Okay, now, let it go.

1173
01:16:22,248 --> 01:16:23,708
-That's good, wasn't it?
-Quite nice.

1174
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:26,878
That's excellent, son.

1175
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:34,219
Mr. Andrews, forgive me...

1176
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:36,554
I did the sum in my head.

1177
01:16:37,013 --> 01:16:38,491
And with the number of lifeboats

1178
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:40,767
times the capacity you mentioned,

1179
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:42,578
forgive me, but it seems that

1180
01:16:42,602 --> 01:16:44,396
there are not enough for everyone aboard.

1181
01:16:45,188 --> 01:16:47,524
About half, actually.

1182
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:49,234
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

1183
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:52,070
In fact, I put in these new type davits

1184
01:16:52,237 --> 01:16:55,115
which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one.

1185
01:16:55,907 --> 01:16:57,760
But it was thought, by some,

1186
01:16:57,784 --> 01:16:59,536
that the deck would look too cluttered.

1187
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:02,122
So, I was overruled.

1188
01:17:02,706 --> 01:17:05,417
Waste of deck space as it is
on an unsinkable ship.

1189
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:09,295
Sleep soundly, young Rose.
I have built you a good ship.

1190
01:17:09,462 --> 01:17:10,773
Strong and true.

1191
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:12,632
She's all the lifeboat you need.

1192
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:13,901
Just keep heading aft.

1193
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:15,445
The next stop will be the engine room.

1194
01:17:16,302 --> 01:17:17,303
Come on.

1195
01:17:21,182 --> 01:17:22,183
Jack.

1196
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:23,852
This is impossible.

1197
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:26,730
-I can't see you.
-I need to talk to you.

1198
01:17:26,938 --> 01:17:28,314
No, Jack. No.

1199
01:17:30,233 --> 01:17:32,235
Jack, I'm engaged.

1200
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,071
I'm marrying Cal.

1201
01:17:36,197 --> 01:17:37,323
I love Cal.

1202
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:42,871
Rose, you're no picnic.

1203
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,374
All right?
You're a spoiled little brat even.

1204
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:47,977
But under that,

1205
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:51,212
you're the most amazingly astounding,

1206
01:17:51,379 --> 01:17:54,883
wonderful girl...
woman that I've ever known.

1207
01:17:55,383 --> 01:17:56,426
-And...
-Jack, I...

1208
01:17:56,634 --> 01:17:57,862
No, let me try and get this out.

1209
01:17:57,886 --> 01:17:58,970
You're...

1210
01:18:01,973 --> 01:18:05,018
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

1211
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:06,704
I've got 10 bucks in my pocket,

1212
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:10,023
I have nothing to offer you,
and I know that.

1213
01:18:10,231 --> 01:18:12,650
I understand.

1214
01:18:12,817 --> 01:18:14,527
But I'm too involved now.

1215
01:18:14,736 --> 01:18:16,696
You jump, I jump, remember?

1216
01:18:17,238 --> 01:18:19,574
I can't turn away
without knowing you'll be all right.

1217
01:18:21,201 --> 01:18:22,202
That's all that I want.

1218
01:18:23,995 --> 01:18:26,456
Well, I'm fine.

1219
01:18:26,623 --> 01:18:28,750
I'll be fine. Really.

1220
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:31,127
Really?

1221
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,381
I don't think so.

1222
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:38,218
They've got you trapped, Rose.

1223
01:18:38,385 --> 01:18:39,945
And you're gonna die if you
don't break free.

1224
01:18:39,969 --> 01:18:41,971
Maybe not right
away because you're strong,

1225
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:47,310
but sooner or later,
that fire that I love about you, Rose,

1226
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:49,771
that fire is gonna burn out.

1227
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:56,778
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

1228
01:18:59,155 --> 01:19:00,865
You're right.

1229
01:19:01,658 --> 01:19:03,159
Only you can do that.

1230
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:12,127
I'm going back. Leave me alone.

1231
01:19:24,305 --> 01:19:27,225
Tell Lucile about the disaster you had
with the stationers.

1232
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:30,437
Well, of course, the invitations
had to be sent back twice.

1233
01:19:30,603 --> 01:19:31,688
Oh, my dear.

1234
01:19:31,896 --> 01:19:33,457
And the dreadful bridesmaids gowns,

1235
01:19:33,481 --> 01:19:35,734
let me tell you what
an odyssey that has been.

1236
01:19:36,276 --> 01:19:38,212
Rose decided she wanted lavender.

1237
01:19:38,236 --> 01:19:40,113
She knows I detest the color.

1238
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:42,198
So she did it only to spite me.

1239
01:19:42,365 --> 01:19:44,200
If only you'd come to me sooner.

1240
01:19:44,659 --> 01:19:47,662
Ruth saw some of my designs in
<i>La Mode Illustrée.</i>

1241
01:19:47,829 --> 01:19:49,098
They were for the trousseau
of the Duchess

1242
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:50,522
of Marlborough's youngest daughter.

1243
01:19:50,665 --> 01:19:51,833
They were quite charming.

1244
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,586
But I think you'll agree, my dear,
that together we've created

1245
01:19:54,794 --> 01:19:57,565
something of a phoenix from the ashes.

1246
01:20:12,687 --> 01:20:13,688
Hello, Jack.

1247
01:20:19,486 --> 01:20:20,695
I changed my mind.

1248
01:20:27,285 --> 01:20:28,387
They said you might be up here.

1249
01:20:28,411 --> 01:20:29,496
Shh.

1250
01:20:31,498 --> 01:20:32,707
Give me your hand.

1251
01:20:40,173 --> 01:20:41,549
Now close your eyes.

1252
01:20:43,009 --> 01:20:44,010
Go on.

1253
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:48,682
Now, step up.

1254
01:20:52,894 --> 01:20:54,163
Now, hold onto the railing.

1255
01:20:54,187 --> 01:20:56,272
Keep your eyes closed, don't peek.

1256
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:57,565
I'm not.

1257
01:20:59,025 --> 01:21:00,360
Step up onto the rail.

1258
01:21:05,031 --> 01:21:07,033
Hold on. Hold on.

1259
01:21:07,492 --> 01:21:09,244
Keep your eyes closed.

1260
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:10,578
Do you trust me?

1261
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:12,539
I trust you.

1262
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:25,385
All right. Open your eyes.

1263
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,686
I'm flying! Jack!

1264
01:21:59,794 --> 01:22:03,548
<i>♪ Come, Josephine
In my flying machine ♪</i>

1265
01:22:03,715 --> 01:22:06,676
<i>♪ Going up, she goes ♪</i>

1266
01:22:06,843 --> 01:22:09,512
<i>♪ Up, she goes ♪</i>

1267
01:22:56,351 --> 01:22:59,437
That was the last time <i>Titanic</i>
ever saw daylight.

1268
01:23:00,814 --> 01:23:03,793
So we're up to dusk the night
of the sinking.

1269
01:23:03,817 --> 01:23:05,026
Six hours to go.

1270
01:23:05,193 --> 01:23:07,612
Incredible.
There's Smith and he's standing there,

1271
01:23:07,821 --> 01:23:09,965
and he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand.

1272
01:23:09,989 --> 01:23:12,784
Excuse me. His hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1273
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:15,954
26 years of experience
working against him.

1274
01:23:16,955 --> 01:23:18,766
He figures anything big enough
to sink the ship,

1275
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:20,166
they're gonna see in time to turn.

1276
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:23,878
The ship's too big with too small a rudder.

1277
01:23:24,087 --> 01:23:25,505
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1278
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:28,883
Everything he knows is wrong.

1279
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:43,874
It's quite proper, I assure you.

1280
01:23:43,898 --> 01:23:45,108
This is the sitting room.

1281
01:23:47,652 --> 01:23:49,654
-Will this light do?
-What?

1282
01:23:50,613 --> 01:23:51,813
Don't artists need good light?

1283
01:23:51,948 --> 01:23:54,969
That is true,
but I'm not used to working

1284
01:23:54,993 --> 01:23:56,327
in such horrible conditions.

1285
01:23:57,579 --> 01:23:58,621
Monet.

1286
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:00,749
Do you know his work?

1287
01:24:00,915 --> 01:24:02,000
Of course.

1288
01:24:02,834 --> 01:24:04,753
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1289
01:24:04,919 --> 01:24:07,047
I know. It's extraordinary.

1290
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:12,302
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1291
01:24:13,345 --> 01:24:15,555
Should we be expecting him anytime soon?

1292
01:24:16,765 --> 01:24:19,351
Not as long as the cigars and
brandy hold out.

1293
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:25,940
Whew. That's nice.
What is it, a sapphire?

1294
01:24:27,275 --> 01:24:30,236
A diamond. A very rare diamond.

1295
01:24:34,407 --> 01:24:36,910
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1296
01:24:38,411 --> 01:24:39,496
Wearing this.

1297
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,247
All right.

1298
01:24:42,957 --> 01:24:45,001
Wearing only this.

1299
01:25:19,869 --> 01:25:21,430
The last thing I need

1300
01:25:21,454 --> 01:25:24,207
is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1301
01:25:28,044 --> 01:25:29,129
As a paying customer,

1302
01:25:31,756 --> 01:25:33,466
I expect to get what I want.

1303
01:25:51,818 --> 01:25:54,654
Over on the bed, uh, the couch.

1304
01:26:03,496 --> 01:26:04,748
Come. Lie down.

1305
01:26:08,585 --> 01:26:09,729
-Yeah, keep that...
-Tell me when it looks right.

1306
01:26:09,753 --> 01:26:11,379
Put your arm back the way it was.

1307
01:26:12,964 --> 01:26:14,007
Right.

1308
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:15,985
Put that other arm up.

1309
01:26:16,009 --> 01:26:17,886
That hand right by your face, there.

1310
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:20,472
Right.

1311
01:26:21,348 --> 01:26:22,974
Now, head down.

1312
01:26:25,685 --> 01:26:27,270
Eyes to me, keep them on me.

1313
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:31,483
And try to stay still.

1314
01:26:50,335 --> 01:26:51,753
So serious.

1315
01:27:34,129 --> 01:27:36,589
I believe you are blushing,
Mr. Big <i>Artiste.</i>

1316
01:27:41,511 --> 01:27:43,638
Can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.

1317
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,392
He does landscapes.

1318
01:27:48,184 --> 01:27:49,644
Just relax your face.

1319
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:51,229
-Sorry.
-No laughing.

1320
01:28:22,927 --> 01:28:25,388
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1321
01:28:26,264 --> 01:28:29,434
It was the most erotic moment of my life.

1322
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,815
Up until then, at least.

1323
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:38,485
So what happened next?

1324
01:28:39,235 --> 01:28:42,280
You mean, did we do it?

1325
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:46,910
<i>Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.</i>

1326
01:28:47,577 --> 01:28:49,329
<i>Jack was very professional.</i>

1327
01:28:57,837 --> 01:28:58,838
Thank you.

1328
01:29:07,263 --> 01:29:08,264
Whatcha doin'?

1329
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:11,196
Will you put this back in the safe for me?

1330
01:29:11,267 --> 01:29:12,268
Mm-hmm.

1331
01:29:18,525 --> 01:29:19,609
Whew.

1332
01:29:23,738 --> 01:29:24,965
Gentlemen, would you excuse me?

1333
01:29:24,989 --> 01:29:25,990
Of course.

1334
01:29:28,034 --> 01:29:29,994
None of the stewards have seen her.

1335
01:29:30,954 --> 01:29:32,706
This is absurd.

1336
01:29:32,872 --> 01:29:35,542
It's a ship.
There's only so many places she could be.

1337
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:38,044
Lovejoy, find her.

1338
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:57,564
-Clear.
-Yes.

1339
01:29:58,356 --> 01:30:00,984
I don't think
I've ever seen such a flat calm.

1340
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:03,440
Like a mill pond.

1341
01:30:04,529 --> 01:30:05,655
Not a breath of wind.

1342
01:30:07,073 --> 01:30:09,451
It will make the 'bergs harder to see.

1343
01:30:10,326 --> 01:30:12,245
With no breaking water at the base.

1344
01:30:14,914 --> 01:30:16,166
Hmm.

1345
01:30:23,923 --> 01:30:27,344
Well, I'm off.
Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.

1346
01:30:28,845 --> 01:30:29,846
Yes, sir.

1347
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:43,902
It's getting cold. You look nice.

1348
01:30:44,235 --> 01:30:45,475
Miss Rose?

1349
01:30:46,237 --> 01:30:47,238
My drawings.

1350
01:31:13,848 --> 01:31:14,974
Come on!

1351
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:19,580
No, wait!
Wait, wait, wait!

1352
01:31:19,604 --> 01:31:20,730
Wait, wait, wait!

1353
01:31:21,231 --> 01:31:22,208
Go, go! Down, down, down!

1354
01:31:22,232 --> 01:31:23,400
Take us down! Quick! Quickly!

1355
01:31:23,608 --> 01:31:25,193
-Go, go, go!
-Quickly, quickly!

1356
01:31:30,949 --> 01:31:32,033
Bye!

1357
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:41,167
Sorry.

1358
01:31:46,631 --> 01:31:47,951
It's all right, sir. I've got it.

1359
01:31:58,643 --> 01:32:00,979
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1360
01:32:01,146 --> 01:32:02,272
Seems more like a cop.

1361
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:03,690
I think he was.

1362
01:32:04,607 --> 01:32:06,067
-Oh, shit!
-Go!

1363
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:08,611
Hold on!

1364
01:32:10,864 --> 01:32:11,948
No, over here!

1365
01:32:12,824 --> 01:32:13,825
Quick!

1366
01:32:20,623 --> 01:32:21,624
Now what?

1367
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:23,376
What?

1368
01:32:29,007 --> 01:32:31,051
Coal.
More coal for number one, mate.

1369
01:32:31,217 --> 01:32:33,386
Hold on.
What are you two doing down here?

1370
01:32:33,845 --> 01:32:36,056
You shouldn't be down here.
It could be dangerous. Oi!

1371
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:43,772
Carry on. Don't mind us.
You're doing a great job.

1372
01:32:43,938 --> 01:32:45,148
Keep up the good work.

1373
01:33:01,915 --> 01:33:03,708
Ah. Look what we have here, huh?

1374
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:23,311
Thank you.

1375
01:33:35,073 --> 01:33:36,408
Where to, miss?

1376
01:33:38,243 --> 01:33:39,285
To the stars.

1377
01:33:59,097 --> 01:34:00,140
You nervous?

1378
01:34:02,934 --> 01:34:03,935
No.

1379
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:22,203
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1380
01:34:47,145 --> 01:34:48,438
Cold. It's bloody cold.

1381
01:34:49,064 --> 01:34:51,858
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1382
01:34:53,902 --> 01:34:54,903
Bollocks!

1383
01:34:55,445 --> 01:34:56,488
Well, I can, all right.

1384
01:34:57,364 --> 01:34:59,491
Did you ever find those
binoculars for the lookouts?

1385
01:34:59,657 --> 01:35:01,097
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1386
01:35:02,410 --> 01:35:04,829
Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.

1387
01:35:36,945 --> 01:35:37,946
You're trembling.

1388
01:35:40,573 --> 01:35:43,118
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

1389
01:36:04,848 --> 01:36:05,849
They ran down there.

1390
01:36:06,016 --> 01:36:07,017
Right.

1391
01:36:16,693 --> 01:36:17,777
Anything missing?

1392
01:36:43,303 --> 01:36:44,387
I've got a better idea.

1393
01:36:57,942 --> 01:36:59,027
Got ya!

1394
01:37:08,411 --> 01:37:10,497
Did you see those guys' faces?

1395
01:37:11,748 --> 01:37:13,166
Did you see them?

1396
01:37:19,923 --> 01:37:21,091
When the ship docks,

1397
01:37:23,134 --> 01:37:24,803
I'm getting off with you.

1398
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:27,013
This is crazy.

1399
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:29,557
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

1400
01:37:31,685 --> 01:37:33,186
That's why I trust it.

1401
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:44,447
Oh, yes. Here, look at this.

1402
01:37:46,157 --> 01:37:47,742
Look at that, would ya?

1403
01:37:47,909 --> 01:37:49,577
They're a bit warmer than we are.

1404
01:37:50,078 --> 01:37:51,806
Well, if that's what it takes
for us to get warm,

1405
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:54,082
I'd rather not, if it's all
the same to you, all right?

1406
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,030
Bugger me!

1407
01:38:13,476 --> 01:38:14,936
Pick up, you bastards.

1408
01:38:18,606 --> 01:38:19,750
<i>Is there anyone there?</i>

1409
01:38:19,774 --> 01:38:20,859
Yes. What do you see?

1410
01:38:21,026 --> 01:38:22,569
Iceberg right ahead.

1411
01:38:22,736 --> 01:38:23,737
Thank you.

1412
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:27,240
Iceberg, right ahead.

1413
01:38:27,532 --> 01:38:29,284
-Hard to starboard.
-Hard to starboard.

1414
01:38:36,499 --> 01:38:38,710
Turn! Turn! Smartly!

1415
01:38:40,628 --> 01:38:42,773
Hey, I'll have some of that.

1416
01:38:42,797 --> 01:38:44,883
-Hey.
-Full astern!

1417
01:38:47,302 --> 01:38:48,279
Hard over.

1418
01:38:48,303 --> 01:38:49,596
Helm's hard over, sir.

1419
01:38:53,683 --> 01:38:55,477
-Go, lads, go.
-Faster, faster!

1420
01:38:57,937 --> 01:39:00,357
Bring that steam down!
Bring it down!

1421
01:39:02,317 --> 01:39:03,902
Shut all the dampers!

1422
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:05,153
Shut them.

1423
01:39:09,866 --> 01:39:10,867
Hold it.

1424
01:39:12,827 --> 01:39:13,828
Hold it.

1425
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:16,998
Now! Engage the reversing engine.

1426
01:39:17,165 --> 01:39:18,285
Bring them down!

1427
01:39:46,069 --> 01:39:47,487
Why ain't they turning?

1428
01:39:47,779 --> 01:39:48,863
Is it hard over?

1429
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:50,573
It is. Yes, sir. Hard over.

1430
01:39:55,245 --> 01:39:57,288
Come on, come on.

1431
01:39:57,497 --> 01:39:59,040
Come on, turn.

1432
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:05,130
Go, lads, go!

1433
01:40:06,297 --> 01:40:07,674
Step lively, go!

1434
01:40:10,593 --> 01:40:12,012
Yes.

1435
01:40:16,975 --> 01:40:18,143
It's gonna hit!

1436
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:31,614
Jesus Christ!

1437
01:40:52,344 --> 01:40:53,553
Jesus.

1438
01:40:53,803 --> 01:40:54,846
Hard to port!

1439
01:40:55,013 --> 01:40:56,389
Hard to port!

1440
01:41:06,399 --> 01:41:07,442
Get back!

1441
01:41:20,789 --> 01:41:21,873
Come on!

1442
01:41:23,208 --> 01:41:24,209
Get down!

1443
01:41:37,097 --> 01:41:39,182
Come on, let's go! Get out the door!

1444
01:41:39,349 --> 01:41:40,517
They're closing the doors!

1445
01:41:41,101 --> 01:41:42,161
-Get out!
-Get out!

1446
01:41:42,185 --> 01:41:43,269
Get out of here!

1447
01:41:43,728 --> 01:41:45,438
Get out of here! Get out!

1448
01:41:48,483 --> 01:41:50,360
Get out the door! Go!

1449
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:52,904
Go! Come on, lads!

1450
01:41:53,071 --> 01:41:54,280
Go, lads, go!

1451
01:42:01,663 --> 01:42:02,664
Get out!

1452
01:42:03,748 --> 01:42:05,000
Go, go!

1453
01:42:05,166 --> 01:42:06,143
Go, come on.

1454
01:42:06,167 --> 01:42:07,627
Out! Out!

1455
01:42:22,809 --> 01:42:24,144
Oh, my God.

1456
01:42:25,395 --> 01:42:26,755
That was a close shave, wasn't it?

1457
01:42:26,938 --> 01:42:29,357
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ.

1458
01:42:30,775 --> 01:42:32,819
Is that hull leaking in?

1459
01:42:34,195 --> 01:42:36,197
Note the time. Enter it in the log.

1460
01:42:42,537 --> 01:42:43,705
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1461
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:46,583
An iceberg, sir.

1462
01:42:47,709 --> 01:42:48,894
I put her hard to starboard

1463
01:42:48,918 --> 01:42:51,171
and ran the engines full astern,
but it was too close.

1464
01:42:51,588 --> 01:42:53,840
I tried to port around it but she hit and...

1465
01:42:54,007 --> 01:42:55,568
Close the watertight doors.

1466
01:42:55,592 --> 01:42:56,992
The doors are closed, sir.

1467
01:43:00,221 --> 01:43:01,222
All stop.

1468
01:43:01,389 --> 01:43:02,640
Aye, sir.

1469
01:43:10,899 --> 01:43:11,876
Find the carpenter.

1470
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:13,380
-Get him to sound the ship.
-Yes, sir.

1471
01:43:24,788 --> 01:43:26,388
Come on, let's get the hell out of here.

1472
01:43:26,998 --> 01:43:28,041
Come on, hurry up.

1473
01:43:33,004 --> 01:43:34,565
Excuse me,
why have the engines stopped?

1474
01:43:34,589 --> 01:43:35,840
I felt a shudder.

1475
01:43:36,007 --> 01:43:36,984
I shouldn't worry, madam.

1476
01:43:37,008 --> 01:43:38,551
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.

1477
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,053
That's the shudder you felt.

1478
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:41,513
May I bring you anything?

1479
01:43:42,555 --> 01:43:43,598
No, thank you.

1480
01:43:48,728 --> 01:43:49,705
Say, old man,
there's talk of an iceberg.

1481
01:43:49,729 --> 01:43:50,855
You see anything?

1482
01:43:51,356 --> 01:43:53,156
Well, I don't see anything now.
Do you?

1483
01:43:54,025 --> 01:43:55,026
Water!

1484
01:43:55,276 --> 01:43:56,504
If this is the direction the rats are going,

1485
01:43:56,528 --> 01:43:57,612
that's good enough for me.

1486
01:43:59,823 --> 01:44:01,324
Please, sir. Please.

1487
01:44:01,491 --> 01:44:02,510
Everything's under control.

1488
01:44:02,534 --> 01:44:04,454
There's nothing
to worry about at all.

1489
01:44:05,537 --> 01:44:07,247
-You there.
-Sir, there is no emergency.

1490
01:44:07,414 --> 01:44:08,998
Yes, there is. I have been robbed.

1491
01:44:09,165 --> 01:44:10,166
Get the Master-at-Arms.

1492
01:44:10,834 --> 01:44:12,961
-Now, you moron.
-Yes, sir.

1493
01:44:16,297 --> 01:44:17,966
Hey! Did I miss the fun?

1494
01:44:19,843 --> 01:44:21,529
-Did you see what happened?
-No, I missed it.

1495
01:44:21,553 --> 01:44:22,753
Apparently, it hit over there.

1496
01:44:24,389 --> 01:44:25,574
Boiler room six is flooded

1497
01:44:25,598 --> 01:44:27,718
eight feet above the plate and the
mail hold is worse.

1498
01:44:27,851 --> 01:44:29,161
She's all buckled in in the forward hold.

1499
01:44:29,185 --> 01:44:30,162
Can you shore up?

1500
01:44:30,186 --> 01:44:31,330
Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1501
01:44:31,354 --> 01:44:32,957
Have you seen the damage in the mail hold?

1502
01:44:32,981 --> 01:44:34,190
No, she's already under water.

1503
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:36,484
This is bad.

1504
01:44:39,362 --> 01:44:40,572
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1505
01:44:42,032 --> 01:44:43,450
I think they're very good, sir.

1506
01:44:46,995 --> 01:44:48,455
Don't touch anything.

1507
01:44:48,621 --> 01:44:49,974
I want the entire room photographed.

1508
01:44:49,998 --> 01:44:51,332
Just keep holding my hand.

1509
01:44:51,791 --> 01:44:53,352
Harold,
do you know what's going on?

1510
01:44:53,376 --> 01:44:54,856
I heard it's just the engine.

1511
01:44:55,128 --> 01:44:56,713
We've been looking for you, miss.

1512
01:45:02,010 --> 01:45:03,053
Here we go.

1513
01:45:09,142 --> 01:45:10,382
Something serious has happened.

1514
01:45:11,895 --> 01:45:13,813
Yes, it has.

1515
01:45:14,898 --> 01:45:17,901
Indeed. Two things dear
to me have disappeared this evening.

1516
01:45:18,443 --> 01:45:19,736
Now that one is back,

1517
01:45:19,903 --> 01:45:21,863
I have a pretty good idea
where to find the other.

1518
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:23,323
Search him.

1519
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:24,467
-Take your coat off, son.
-Now what?

1520
01:45:24,491 --> 01:45:25,658
Come on, now.

1521
01:45:26,076 --> 01:45:27,928
Cal, what are you doing?

1522
01:45:27,952 --> 01:45:29,180
We are in the middle of an emergency.

1523
01:45:29,204 --> 01:45:30,205
What's going on?

1524
01:45:30,455 --> 01:45:32,457
-Is this it?
-That's it.

1525
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:34,834
This is horseshit!

1526
01:45:36,086 --> 01:45:37,629
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.

1527
01:45:37,796 --> 01:45:39,556
-He couldn't have.
-Of course, he could.

1528
01:45:39,673 --> 01:45:41,067
It's easy enough for a professional.

1529
01:45:41,091 --> 01:45:42,550
-Come on.
-But I was with him

1530
01:45:42,717 --> 01:45:44,094
the whole time. This is absurd.

1531
01:45:44,552 --> 01:45:47,232
Perhaps he did it while you were
putting your clothes back on, dear.

1532
01:45:48,932 --> 01:45:49,992
Real slick, Cal.

1533
01:45:50,016 --> 01:45:51,243
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1534
01:45:51,267 --> 01:45:52,244
Shut up.

1535
01:45:52,268 --> 01:45:54,148
It isn't even your pocket, is it, son?

1536
01:45:54,312 --> 01:45:55,939
"Property of A. L. Ryerson."

1537
01:46:00,443 --> 01:46:01,504
That was reported stolen today.

1538
01:46:01,528 --> 01:46:02,612
No, I just borrowed it.

1539
01:46:02,779 --> 01:46:04,674
-I was going to return it.
-Oh, an honest thief.

1540
01:46:04,698 --> 01:46:06,366
We have an honest thief here, do we?

1541
01:46:06,533 --> 01:46:08,702
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
You know it.

1542
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,513
Don't you believe them, Rose.

1543
01:46:10,537 --> 01:46:11,597
You know it.
You know I didn't do it.

1544
01:46:11,621 --> 01:46:12,682
Come on, son, let's go.
Come on, let's go.

1545
01:46:12,706 --> 01:46:13,849
Rose, you know I didn't do it, Rose!

1546
01:46:13,873 --> 01:46:14,958
-Don't make a fuss.
-Rose!

1547
01:46:15,125 --> 01:46:16,102
Come on. There's a good lad.

1548
01:46:16,126 --> 01:46:17,446
Come on, son. There's a good lad.

1549
01:46:17,502 --> 01:46:18,503
Come on.

1550
01:46:18,670 --> 01:46:20,964
You know I didn't do it! You know me!

1551
01:46:22,632 --> 01:46:24,384
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1552
01:46:28,638 --> 01:46:31,891
Water 14 feet above the keel in 10 minutes,

1553
01:46:32,058 --> 01:46:35,603
in the forepeak, in all three holds
and in boiler room six.

1554
01:46:35,770 --> 01:46:36,771
That's right, sir.

1555
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:38,398
When can we get underway, damn it?

1556
01:46:38,773 --> 01:46:40,025
That's five compartments.

1557
01:46:42,652 --> 01:46:44,755
She can stay afloat with
the first four compartments

1558
01:46:44,779 --> 01:46:45,864
breached, but not five.

1559
01:46:47,282 --> 01:46:48,783
Not five.

1560
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:50,177
As she goes down by the head,

1561
01:46:50,201 --> 01:46:52,787
the water will spill over the tops
of the bulkheads

1562
01:46:52,996 --> 01:46:55,331
at E deck from one to the next.

1563
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:57,625
Back and back.
There's no stopping it.

1564
01:46:58,835 --> 01:47:00,021
The pumps, if we opened the doors...

1565
01:47:00,045 --> 01:47:01,129
The pumps buy you time.

1566
01:47:01,671 --> 01:47:03,256
But minutes only.

1567
01:47:04,049 --> 01:47:06,176
From this moment, no matter what we do,

1568
01:47:07,218 --> 01:47:08,803
<i>Titanic</i> will founder.

1569
01:47:11,723 --> 01:47:12,974
But this ship can't sink.

1570
01:47:13,141 --> 01:47:15,268
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you, she can.

1571
01:47:16,478 --> 01:47:17,520
And she will.

1572
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,939
It is a mathematical certainty.

1573
01:47:24,986 --> 01:47:26,071
How much time?

1574
01:47:33,661 --> 01:47:34,662
An hour.

1575
01:47:35,163 --> 01:47:36,206
Two at most.

1576
01:47:42,504 --> 01:47:43,922
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1577
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:47,092
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1578
01:47:54,599 --> 01:47:57,394
Well, I believe you may
get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1579
01:48:15,328 --> 01:48:16,996
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1580
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,100
You look at me when I'm talking to you!

1581
01:48:20,875 --> 01:48:23,086
-Mr. Hockley?
-Not now, we're busy.

1582
01:48:23,336 --> 01:48:25,964
Sir, I've been told to ask you
to put on your lifebelts

1583
01:48:26,131 --> 01:48:28,011
-and come up to the boat deck.
-I said, not now.

1584
01:48:28,049 --> 01:48:29,986
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Mr. Hockley,

1585
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:31,177
but it's Captain's orders.

1586
01:48:31,344 --> 01:48:33,304
Now, please, dress warmly.

1587
01:48:33,471 --> 01:48:35,015
It's quite cold out tonight.

1588
01:48:36,266 --> 01:48:39,019
Now may I suggest, top coats and hats.

1589
01:48:39,227 --> 01:48:40,395
This is ridiculous.

1590
01:48:41,646 --> 01:48:43,207
Not to worry, miss.

1591
01:48:43,231 --> 01:48:45,358
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1592
01:48:45,525 --> 01:48:47,444
Everybody up, lifebelts on!

1593
01:48:49,529 --> 01:48:50,905
What? What's he on about?

1594
01:48:51,614 --> 01:48:52,633
Everybody up, put your lifebelts on.

1595
01:48:52,657 --> 01:48:53,742
What's the ruckus?

1596
01:48:53,950 --> 01:48:55,243
Just put your lifebelts on.

1597
01:48:56,786 --> 01:48:58,997
C.Q.D.? Sir?

1598
01:49:01,249 --> 01:49:02,375
That's right. C.Q.D.

1599
01:49:02,584 --> 01:49:05,045
The distress call. That's our position.

1600
01:49:10,842 --> 01:49:13,136
Tell whoever responds
that we're going down by the head

1601
01:49:13,303 --> 01:49:14,929
and need immediate assistance.

1602
01:49:24,314 --> 01:49:25,774
Blimey.

1603
01:49:34,616 --> 01:49:35,617
Hold her underway.

1604
01:49:35,909 --> 01:49:38,787
Keep lowering. Keep lowering.

1605
01:49:39,412 --> 01:49:41,081
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Pull.

1606
01:49:41,289 --> 01:49:42,499
Easy now!

1607
01:49:43,792 --> 01:49:47,295
Steady! Make it taut! And winch it out!

1608
01:49:51,508 --> 01:49:55,178
Uncover this boat!
Uncover all the boats aft!

1609
01:49:56,054 --> 01:49:57,294
Release those ties!

1610
01:49:57,472 --> 01:49:58,449
Roll back that cover!

1611
01:49:58,473 --> 01:49:59,533
Roll back that cover smartly, now!

1612
01:49:59,557 --> 01:50:00,684
Mr. Wilde.

1613
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:01,827
Release the boat from...

1614
01:50:01,851 --> 01:50:03,162
Mr. Wilde.
Where are the passengers?

1615
01:50:03,186 --> 01:50:04,330
They've all gone back inside.

1616
01:50:04,354 --> 01:50:06,356
Too damn cold and noisy for them.

1617
01:50:06,564 --> 01:50:07,604
You there.

1618
01:50:08,692 --> 01:50:11,027
Get down here and help with these lines!

1619
01:50:25,458 --> 01:50:26,626
Care for a drink, sir?

1620
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:30,356
-Please put your lifebelt on.
-Hey, sonny.

1621
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:31,381
-Miss.
-What's doing?

1622
01:50:31,548 --> 01:50:34,050
You got us all trussed up here
and now we're cooling our heels.

1623
01:50:34,676 --> 01:50:36,386
Sorry, ma'am.
Let me go and find out.

1624
01:50:36,553 --> 01:50:37,738
Make sure the straps are secure.

1625
01:50:37,762 --> 01:50:40,199
I don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on around here.

1626
01:50:40,223 --> 01:50:42,851
It's just the goddamned English
doing everything by the book.

1627
01:50:43,393 --> 01:50:45,562
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.

1628
01:50:46,438 --> 01:50:48,690
Go back and turn the heaters on in our rooms.

1629
01:50:48,857 --> 01:50:50,650
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.

1630
01:50:50,817 --> 01:50:51,818
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

1631
01:50:57,699 --> 01:50:59,510
Will you put your lifebelt on, please?

1632
01:50:59,534 --> 01:51:01,703
I don't understand why
didn't they know?

1633
01:51:01,911 --> 01:51:02,996
Mr. Andrews?

1634
01:51:05,165 --> 01:51:06,166
I saw the iceberg.

1635
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:07,834
And I see it in your eyes.

1636
01:51:09,085 --> 01:51:10,420
Please tell me the truth.

1637
01:51:10,879 --> 01:51:12,879
Yes, madam.
Please, put it on immediately.

1638
01:51:18,887 --> 01:51:20,555
The ship will sink.

1639
01:51:22,474 --> 01:51:24,184
-You're certain?
-Yes.

1640
01:51:24,351 --> 01:51:25,518
In an hour or so.

1641
01:51:26,811 --> 01:51:28,811
All of this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1642
01:51:30,648 --> 01:51:31,649
What?

1643
01:51:31,816 --> 01:51:33,735
Please, tell only who you must.

1644
01:51:33,985 --> 01:51:36,237
I don't want to be responsible for a panic.

1645
01:51:36,404 --> 01:51:38,782
And get to a boat, quickly. Don't wait.

1646
01:51:40,116 --> 01:51:42,327
You remember what I told you
about the boats?

1647
01:51:45,789 --> 01:51:46,831
Yes.

1648
01:51:48,625 --> 01:51:50,168
I understand.

1649
01:51:53,588 --> 01:51:54,649
Have I put this thing on right?

1650
01:51:54,673 --> 01:51:56,633
Yes, madam.
Please put it on immediately.

1651
01:51:58,134 --> 01:51:59,135
Over here, son.

1652
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:01,864
Sir, they need you up in

1653
01:52:01,888 --> 01:52:03,115
the Second-Class Purser's office.

1654
01:52:03,139 --> 01:52:04,539
-There's a big mob up there.
-Go on.

1655
01:52:04,683 --> 01:52:05,850
I'll keep an eye on him.

1656
01:52:06,643 --> 01:52:08,144
Aye. Right.

1657
01:52:21,991 --> 01:52:23,118
Sir.

1658
01:52:23,368 --> 01:52:25,596
<i>Carpathia</i> says they're making 17 knots.

1659
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:27,080
Full steam for them, sir.

1660
01:52:28,998 --> 01:52:30,667
She's the only one who's responded?

1661
01:52:30,834 --> 01:52:32,210
The only one close, sir.

1662
01:52:32,377 --> 01:52:34,337
Says they can be here in four hours.

1663
01:52:35,171 --> 01:52:36,297
Four hours?

1664
01:52:41,886 --> 01:52:42,929
Thank you, Bride.

1665
01:52:47,767 --> 01:52:49,310
My God.

1666
01:52:49,936 --> 01:52:51,664
I really don't think so, Mr. Wilde.

1667
01:52:51,688 --> 01:52:53,231
Secure the falls aft.

1668
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,361
Sir?

1669
01:52:58,778 --> 01:53:00,905
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1670
01:53:02,490 --> 01:53:04,427
Hadn't we better get the women and children

1671
01:53:04,451 --> 01:53:05,535
into the boats, sir?

1672
01:53:07,954 --> 01:53:08,997
Yes.

1673
01:53:09,539 --> 01:53:10,707
Sir?

1674
01:53:13,335 --> 01:53:16,212
Women and children first. Yes.

1675
01:53:18,173 --> 01:53:19,341
Yes, sir.

1676
01:53:22,218 --> 01:53:23,529
Ladies and gentlemen,

1677
01:53:23,553 --> 01:53:24,929
your attention, please!

1678
01:53:25,597 --> 01:53:27,932
Step this way, please! That's right!

1679
01:53:28,099 --> 01:53:30,560
Come towards me! Thank you!

1680
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:33,021
Good.

1681
01:53:33,396 --> 01:53:34,623
For the time being,

1682
01:53:34,647 --> 01:53:37,442
I shall require only women and children.

1683
01:53:37,609 --> 01:53:38,586
Gentlemen, please stay where you are.

1684
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:39,736
Right here.

1685
01:53:39,861 --> 01:53:41,422
All right, boys. Like the captain said.

1686
01:53:41,446 --> 01:53:43,031
Nice and cheery so there's no panic.

1687
01:53:43,239 --> 01:53:44,383
Gentlemen please stay exactly
where you are.

1688
01:53:44,407 --> 01:53:45,492
"Wedding Dance."

1689
01:53:54,584 --> 01:53:57,170
Lifebelts on.
Here, put your lifebelts on.

1690
01:53:57,337 --> 01:54:00,006
Put your lifebelts on.
Here, put your lifebelt on.

1691
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:02,425
Here, come on. Put your lifebelt on.

1692
01:54:02,592 --> 01:54:04,177
Turn that around.

1693
01:54:05,470 --> 01:54:06,947
Please, ladies and gentlemen,

1694
01:54:06,971 --> 01:54:08,515
there isn't any reason to panic.

1695
01:54:08,682 --> 01:54:11,184
It isn't time to go up to the boats yet.

1696
01:54:11,434 --> 01:54:13,061
Please, stay calm.

1697
01:54:13,311 --> 01:54:14,955
Look, please, make sure, everybody,

1698
01:54:14,979 --> 01:54:16,856
you've got your lifebelts on.

1699
01:54:17,107 --> 01:54:18,376
And gentlemen,
allow the women and children

1700
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,484
through to the front.

1701
01:54:19,901 --> 01:54:22,362
-What are we doing, Mommy?
-We're just waiting, dear.

1702
01:54:22,529 --> 01:54:24,882
When they finish putting
first-class people in the boats,

1703
01:54:24,906 --> 01:54:26,008
they'll be starting with us,

1704
01:54:26,032 --> 01:54:27,672
and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?

1705
01:54:27,867 --> 01:54:28,886
Everybody, not just quite yet.

1706
01:54:28,910 --> 01:54:30,137
Don't push on the gates.

1707
01:54:30,161 --> 01:54:31,538
You won't get out any faster.

1708
01:54:31,913 --> 01:54:33,081
Go and get some help.

1709
01:54:33,415 --> 01:54:37,377
Lower it away.
Left and right together. Steady.

1710
01:54:38,211 --> 01:54:40,588
Both sides together. Steady.

1711
01:54:41,589 --> 01:54:42,590
Steady.

1712
01:54:43,008 --> 01:54:43,985
Steady.

1713
01:54:44,009 --> 01:54:45,569
All right, steady as she goes.

1714
01:54:45,885 --> 01:54:47,012
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1715
01:54:48,430 --> 01:54:49,764
Hold the left side!

1716
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:52,642
Right side only! Right side only!

1717
01:54:52,851 --> 01:54:55,311
Right side only! Hold the left side!

1718
01:54:55,478 --> 01:54:58,273
Right side down! Lower away together!

1719
01:55:00,608 --> 01:55:02,068
Steady, lads!

1720
01:55:22,839 --> 01:55:23,858
I need two men each

1721
01:55:23,882 --> 01:55:25,508
to handle the fore and aft port. Now.

1722
01:55:49,491 --> 01:55:52,786
You know,
I do believe this ship may sink.

1723
01:55:55,205 --> 01:55:57,600
I've been asked to give you
this small token

1724
01:55:57,624 --> 01:55:58,958
of our appreciation.

1725
01:56:02,170 --> 01:56:04,839
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1726
01:56:10,887 --> 01:56:11,864
Step aboard, sir.

1727
01:56:11,888 --> 01:56:13,324
Come on, sister.
You heard the man. Into the boat.

1728
01:56:13,348 --> 01:56:14,617
These gentlemen will take
care of you.

1729
01:56:14,641 --> 01:56:16,518
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

1730
01:56:16,685 --> 01:56:18,162
Only women at this time, sir.

1731
01:56:18,186 --> 01:56:19,205
Thank you.

1732
01:56:19,229 --> 01:56:20,669
This man here will take care of you.

1733
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:23,983
Will the lifeboats be seated according to class?

1734
01:56:25,652 --> 01:56:27,862
I hope they're not too crowded.

1735
01:56:29,239 --> 01:56:31,491
Oh, Mother. Shut up!

1736
01:56:32,117 --> 01:56:33,410
Don't you understand?

1737
01:56:33,743 --> 01:56:35,783
The water is freezing
and there aren't enough boats.

1738
01:56:36,079 --> 01:56:37,288
Not enough by half.

1739
01:56:38,373 --> 01:56:40,213
Half the people on this ship are going to die.

1740
01:56:40,917 --> 01:56:41,960
Not the better half.

1741
01:56:44,462 --> 01:56:45,702
Come on, Ruth. Get in the boat.

1742
01:56:46,089 --> 01:56:47,529
First-class seats are right up here.

1743
01:56:49,342 --> 01:56:51,153
You know, it's a pity
I didn't keep that drawing.

1744
01:56:51,177 --> 01:56:52,762
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1745
01:56:53,138 --> 01:56:54,532
Women and children

1746
01:56:54,556 --> 01:56:56,474
towards the front beam.

1747
01:56:56,641 --> 01:56:58,768
You unimaginable bastard.

1748
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:00,997
Come on, Rose, darlin'.

1749
01:57:01,021 --> 01:57:02,261
There's plenty of room for you.

1750
01:57:02,647 --> 01:57:03,666
Right this way, miss.

1751
01:57:03,690 --> 01:57:04,774
Come on, Rose.

1752
01:57:05,650 --> 01:57:06,735
You're next, darlin'.

1753
01:57:07,652 --> 01:57:08,737
Come into the boat, Rose.

1754
01:57:10,864 --> 01:57:11,865
Come.

1755
01:57:12,115 --> 01:57:13,116
Rose!

1756
01:57:14,576 --> 01:57:15,660
Get into the boat.

1757
01:57:16,619 --> 01:57:17,620
Rose.

1758
01:57:19,330 --> 01:57:20,540
Goodbye, Mother.

1759
01:57:22,667 --> 01:57:23,877
Rose?

1760
01:57:24,044 --> 01:57:25,229
Rose, come back here right now!

1761
01:57:25,253 --> 01:57:26,671
Where are you going?

1762
01:57:27,130 --> 01:57:28,256
What, to him?

1763
01:57:28,465 --> 01:57:30,258
What? To be a whore to a gutter rat?

1764
01:57:30,550 --> 01:57:31,551
No, wait!

1765
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,928
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.

1766
01:57:36,598 --> 01:57:37,766
No! No!

1767
01:57:39,351 --> 01:57:40,352
I said, no!

1768
01:57:42,479 --> 01:57:44,314
Rose! Please, stop!

1769
01:57:45,482 --> 01:57:47,776
-And lower away!
-No, Rose!

1770
01:57:47,942 --> 01:57:49,382
-And together.
-No, wait!

1771
01:57:49,527 --> 01:57:50,737
Lower away!

1772
01:57:51,196 --> 01:57:53,156
-Rose!
-Lower together!

1773
01:57:53,573 --> 01:57:54,574
Pull the left side in!

1774
01:57:58,828 --> 01:57:59,829
Help!

1775
01:58:00,663 --> 01:58:02,725
Can anybody hear me?

1776
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,794
Hello, help me!

1777
01:58:06,378 --> 01:58:07,754
Help me!

1778
01:58:08,129 --> 01:58:10,215
Can you hear me?

1779
01:58:10,882 --> 01:58:12,634
Can anybody hear me?

1780
01:58:12,801 --> 01:58:14,469
Somebody help me!

1781
01:58:15,887 --> 01:58:16,971
Mr. Andrews!

1782
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,244
Steward, check the starboard corridor.

1783
01:58:22,268 --> 01:58:23,353
Yes, Mr. Andrews.

1784
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:26,160
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt,
get to the boat deck immediately.

1785
01:58:26,731 --> 01:58:28,376
Lucy, for God's sake, put on your lifebelt.

1786
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:29,693
-Set a good example.
-Yes, sir.

1787
01:58:31,111 --> 01:58:32,404
-Anyone in here?
-Mr. Andrews!

1788
01:58:32,696 --> 01:58:34,406
Mr. Andrews! Thank God!

1789
01:58:34,906 --> 01:58:37,146
Where would the Master-at-Arms
take someone under arrest?

1790
01:58:37,242 --> 01:58:39,285
What?
You have to get to a boat right away.

1791
01:58:39,494 --> 01:58:42,622
No!
I'm doing this with or without your help, sir.

1792
01:58:42,789 --> 01:58:43,949
But without will take longer.

1793
01:58:46,292 --> 01:58:48,003
Take the elevator to the very bottom,

1794
01:58:48,169 --> 01:58:50,296
go to the left. Down the crewman's passage.

1795
01:58:50,839 --> 01:58:52,882
Then go right and left again at the stairs,

1796
01:58:53,049 --> 01:58:54,592
you'll come to a long corridor.

1797
01:58:59,472 --> 01:59:00,557
This could be bad.

1798
01:59:04,978 --> 01:59:06,396
Oh, shit!

1799
01:59:06,563 --> 01:59:07,731
Oh, shit!

1800
01:59:13,069 --> 01:59:14,237
Excuse me. Thank you.

1801
01:59:16,072 --> 01:59:17,091
I do not care what you think.

1802
01:59:17,115 --> 01:59:18,450
The lifts are...

1803
01:59:18,616 --> 01:59:20,952
I'm sorry, miss, but the lifts are closed.

1804
01:59:22,537 --> 01:59:24,914
I'm through being polite, goddamn it!

1805
01:59:25,081 --> 01:59:26,249
Now take me down!

1806
01:59:27,959 --> 01:59:28,960
E deck.

1807
01:59:32,839 --> 01:59:33,840
Come on!

1808
01:59:34,299 --> 01:59:35,467
Come on, come on!

1809
01:59:53,610 --> 01:59:55,487
-I'm going back up!
-No!

1810
01:59:55,653 --> 01:59:56,946
No, no!

1811
01:59:57,405 --> 01:59:58,406
Miss!

1812
02:00:01,076 --> 02:00:02,952
Come back! I'm going back up!

1813
02:00:03,244 --> 02:00:04,245
I'm going back up!

1814
02:00:13,213 --> 02:00:14,214
Crew passage.

1815
02:00:15,882 --> 02:00:17,008
Crew passage.

1816
02:00:37,654 --> 02:00:38,655
Jack!

1817
02:00:43,493 --> 02:00:44,494
Jack!

1818
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:49,541
Jack!

1819
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:52,502
-Jack!
-Rose!

1820
02:00:54,087 --> 02:00:56,423
-Jack!
-Rose, I'm in here!

1821
02:00:57,048 --> 02:00:58,425
-I'm in here!
-Jack!

1822
02:00:58,800 --> 02:00:59,801
I'm in here!

1823
02:00:59,968 --> 02:01:00,969
-Jack!
-Rose!

1824
02:01:01,136 --> 02:01:02,929
Jack! Jack!

1825
02:01:03,096 --> 02:01:04,097
I'm sorry!

1826
02:01:04,264 --> 02:01:06,182
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

1827
02:01:07,726 --> 02:01:09,036
That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket.

1828
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:11,271
I know! I know! I know! I know!

1829
02:01:11,438 --> 02:01:12,522
Listen, Rose,

1830
02:01:12,689 --> 02:01:14,500
you're gonna have to find a spare key,
all right?

1831
02:01:14,524 --> 02:01:15,501
All right.

1832
02:01:15,525 --> 02:01:16,845
Look in that cabinet right there.

1833
02:01:17,610 --> 02:01:19,070
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1834
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:21,781
Silver one.

1835
02:01:22,323 --> 02:01:23,783
These are all brass ones!

1836
02:01:24,576 --> 02:01:25,702
Check right here, Rose.

1837
02:01:30,707 --> 02:01:31,708
Rose.

1838
02:01:33,043 --> 02:01:34,502
How did you find out I didn't do it?

1839
02:01:35,462 --> 02:01:38,006
I didn't. I just realized I already knew.

1840
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:41,801
Keep looking!

1841
02:01:51,269 --> 02:01:52,562
No key.

1842
02:01:52,729 --> 02:01:54,606
-There's no key!
-All right, Rose, listen.

1843
02:01:54,773 --> 02:01:56,358
You're gonna have to go find some help.

1844
02:01:57,275 --> 02:01:58,276
It'll be all right.

1845
02:02:03,698 --> 02:02:04,783
I'll be right back.

1846
02:02:12,832 --> 02:02:14,084
I'll just wait here!

1847
02:02:27,597 --> 02:02:29,140
Hello, is there anyone here?

1848
02:02:30,058 --> 02:02:31,101
Hello!

1849
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:33,520
Is there anybody down here?

1850
02:02:34,938 --> 02:02:37,023
We need help! Hello!

1851
02:02:38,149 --> 02:02:39,150
Damn it!

1852
02:02:45,824 --> 02:02:48,284
Can anybody hear me? Please! Hello!

1853
02:02:48,785 --> 02:02:49,828
Hello!

1854
02:02:52,038 --> 02:02:54,249
Thank God! Wait, please!
I need your help!

1855
02:02:54,416 --> 02:02:56,056
There's a man back here and...

1856
02:02:56,710 --> 02:02:57,711
Wait!

1857
02:03:01,965 --> 02:03:03,299
Hello?

1858
02:03:28,950 --> 02:03:29,951
Hello?

1859
02:03:30,744 --> 02:03:31,762
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1860
02:03:31,786 --> 02:03:32,847
Wait. Please!

1861
02:03:32,871 --> 02:03:34,247
-I need your help.
-Come along.

1862
02:03:34,414 --> 02:03:35,415
This way, quickly.

1863
02:03:35,623 --> 02:03:36,809
There's a man down here and he is trapped.

1864
02:03:36,833 --> 02:03:38,193
-This way. Yes, all right.
-Please!

1865
02:03:38,251 --> 02:03:40,211
-There's no need to panic.
-No, I'm not panicking!

1866
02:03:40,253 --> 02:03:42,297
You're going the wrong way!

1867
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:43,798
Let go of me! Listen!

1868
02:03:49,846 --> 02:03:50,930
To hell with you.

1869
02:04:28,468 --> 02:04:29,928
Oh, my God.

1870
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:19,561
Jack!

1871
02:05:20,311 --> 02:05:21,312
Rose!

1872
02:05:22,439 --> 02:05:23,440
Will this work?

1873
02:05:24,983 --> 02:05:26,735
I guess we'll find out. Come on!

1874
02:05:30,822 --> 02:05:32,240
Wait, wait, wait.

1875
02:05:32,407 --> 02:05:34,242
Try a couple of practice swings over there.

1876
02:05:34,993 --> 02:05:35,994
All right.

1877
02:05:39,497 --> 02:05:40,683
Good.

1878
02:05:40,707 --> 02:05:43,209
Now try and hit the same mark again, Rose.
You can do it.

1879
02:05:50,050 --> 02:05:51,718
Okay, that's enough practice.

1880
02:05:51,885 --> 02:05:54,262
Come on, Rose. You can do it.

1881
02:05:54,596 --> 02:05:57,724
Listen, just hit it really hard and really fast.

1882
02:05:59,934 --> 02:06:01,186
Come on. Wait!

1883
02:06:01,353 --> 02:06:03,438
Open your hands up a little more. Good.

1884
02:06:03,605 --> 02:06:04,898
-Like that?
-Right.

1885
02:06:05,774 --> 02:06:06,858
Listen, Rose.

1886
02:06:07,025 --> 02:06:08,151
I trust you.

1887
02:06:12,781 --> 02:06:13,782
Go!

1888
02:06:19,788 --> 02:06:20,789
You did it!

1889
02:06:21,539 --> 02:06:22,665
Come on! Let's go!

1890
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:24,876
Oh, shit, this is cold!

1891
02:06:25,919 --> 02:06:27,712
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1892
02:06:33,510 --> 02:06:35,345
This is the way out.

1893
02:06:35,512 --> 02:06:37,305
We have to find another way.
Come on!

1894
02:06:38,515 --> 02:06:39,516
Pull!

1895
02:06:41,059 --> 02:06:42,060
Pull!

1896
02:06:42,727 --> 02:06:43,812
Put your backs into it!

1897
02:06:43,978 --> 02:06:44,979
Pull!

1898
02:06:50,110 --> 02:06:51,111
Pull!

1899
02:06:52,028 --> 02:06:54,197
Now there's something you
don't see every day.

1900
02:06:54,572 --> 02:06:55,573
Pull!

1901
02:07:15,510 --> 02:07:16,779
There's no room
for luggage in this boat!

1902
02:07:16,803 --> 02:07:18,603
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it!

1903
02:07:18,680 --> 02:07:20,056
Get rid of it. We need the room.

1904
02:07:20,265 --> 02:07:21,516
Get rid of that. Out!

1905
02:07:22,475 --> 02:07:25,145
This way. Let go, sir! Get back!

1906
02:07:25,937 --> 02:07:27,737
Keep calm. Sit down.

1907
02:07:28,314 --> 02:07:29,566
-No!
-Move along now.

1908
02:07:29,899 --> 02:07:31,234
Make more room.

1909
02:07:31,401 --> 02:07:32,402
That's right. Let's go!

1910
02:07:33,611 --> 02:07:35,530
-This way, please.
-Lovejoy!

1911
02:07:35,697 --> 02:07:37,297
She's not on the starboard side, either.

1912
02:07:38,241 --> 02:07:39,492
We're running out of time.

1913
02:07:39,659 --> 02:07:42,203
And this strutting martinet
isn't letting any men on at all.

1914
02:07:42,871 --> 02:07:44,873
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

1915
02:07:45,498 --> 02:07:46,708
Well, then, that's our play.

1916
02:07:47,584 --> 02:07:49,627
We'll need some insurance, first.
Come on!

1917
02:07:50,503 --> 02:07:52,422
Come on this way.
It's all the way down there.

1918
02:07:55,717 --> 02:07:56,718
Here!

1919
02:07:57,385 --> 02:07:58,928
What do you think you're doin'?

1920
02:07:59,804 --> 02:08:01,348
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

1921
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:03,808
That's White Star Line property.

1922
02:08:03,975 --> 02:08:05,018
Shut up!

1923
02:08:06,561 --> 02:08:07,747
Will you hold the boat a moment?

1924
02:08:07,771 --> 02:08:09,171
I just have to run back to my room.

1925
02:08:10,357 --> 02:08:11,358
Sit down!

1926
02:08:12,067 --> 02:08:13,068
She's the last.

1927
02:08:13,443 --> 02:08:14,819
-Prepare to lower.
-Mr. Lightoller.

1928
02:08:15,487 --> 02:08:17,167
Why are the boats
being launched half full?

1929
02:08:17,322 --> 02:08:18,865
-Not now, Mr. Andrews.
-There, look.

1930
02:08:19,366 --> 02:08:21,701
Twenty or so in a boat built for 65?

1931
02:08:21,868 --> 02:08:24,204
And I saw one boat with only 12! 12!

1932
02:08:24,579 --> 02:08:27,290
Well, we weren't sure
of the weight, Mr. Andrews.

1933
02:08:27,457 --> 02:08:28,917
These boats may buckle.

1934
02:08:29,084 --> 02:08:30,085
Rubbish.

1935
02:08:30,210 --> 02:08:32,629
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1936
02:08:32,796 --> 02:08:34,440
Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller,

1937
02:08:34,464 --> 02:08:35,674
for God's sake, man!

1938
02:08:43,139 --> 02:08:44,140
Please.

1939
02:08:44,349 --> 02:08:45,975
I need more women and children, please.

1940
02:08:51,106 --> 02:08:52,232
Get back in there.

1941
02:08:52,399 --> 02:08:53,959
-This is not an exit.
-Get back. Get back in there.

1942
02:08:53,983 --> 02:08:55,110
It's not an exit!

1943
02:08:57,779 --> 02:08:59,507
You can't keep
us locked in here like animals.

1944
02:08:59,531 --> 02:09:01,533
-The ship's bloody sinking.
-Stand back!

1945
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:03,576
Bring forward the women!

1946
02:09:03,743 --> 02:09:05,453
Unlock the gates. Come on.

1947
02:09:06,579 --> 02:09:07,664
Women only!

1948
02:09:08,873 --> 02:09:10,792
No men! Get back!

1949
02:09:11,084 --> 02:09:12,085
No men!

1950
02:09:17,215 --> 02:09:18,675
Get back!

1951
02:09:20,093 --> 02:09:21,094
Get back!

1952
02:09:21,428 --> 02:09:22,679
Lock the gates!

1953
02:09:23,221 --> 02:09:25,098
Get away from those gates!

1954
02:09:25,932 --> 02:09:27,434
Don't touch the gate!

1955
02:09:31,354 --> 02:09:34,315
For God's sake, man,
there are women and children down here!

1956
02:09:34,774 --> 02:09:36,985
Let us out so we can have a chance!

1957
02:09:37,610 --> 02:09:38,611
Get back!

1958
02:09:42,407 --> 02:09:43,616
-Jack!
-Tommy!

1959
02:09:43,783 --> 02:09:45,493
-Can we get out?
-It's hopeless that way.

1960
02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:47,460
Well, whatever we do, we've gotta do it fast.

1961
02:09:47,787 --> 02:09:48,788
Jack!

1962
02:09:49,622 --> 02:09:50,623
Fabrizio!

1963
02:09:51,166 --> 02:09:52,375
The boats are all gone!

1964
02:09:52,751 --> 02:09:54,562
This whole place is flooding.
We've gotta get out of here.

1965
02:09:54,586 --> 02:09:55,628
There's <i>niente</i> this way.

1966
02:09:55,837 --> 02:09:56,838
All right.

1967
02:09:57,005 --> 02:09:58,485
Let's go this way, all right?
Come on!

1968
02:10:04,304 --> 02:10:05,347
I make my own luck.

1969
02:10:05,764 --> 02:10:06,806
So do I.

1970
02:10:15,023 --> 02:10:16,066
Come on!

1971
02:10:16,816 --> 02:10:18,056
No! Come on, let's go this way.

1972
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:28,787
This way!

1973
02:10:28,953 --> 02:10:31,164
Just go back to the main stairwell

1974
02:10:31,331 --> 02:10:33,208
and everything will be sorted out there.

1975
02:10:33,375 --> 02:10:34,626
The hell it will.

1976
02:10:34,793 --> 02:10:36,562
It will all get sorted out back there.

1977
02:10:36,586 --> 02:10:38,171
Go back to the main stairwell!

1978
02:10:38,338 --> 02:10:39,315
Open the gate.

1979
02:10:39,339 --> 02:10:40,399
Go back down the main stairwell.

1980
02:10:40,423 --> 02:10:41,508
Open the gate right now!

1981
02:10:41,675 --> 02:10:44,135
Go back down the main stairwell
like I told you!

1982
02:10:46,346 --> 02:10:49,140
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

1983
02:10:49,307 --> 02:10:50,308
Stop that!

1984
02:10:50,517 --> 02:10:52,060
Open the damn gate! Open it!

1985
02:10:55,146 --> 02:10:56,290
Fabri, Tommy, give me a hand!

1986
02:10:56,314 --> 02:10:57,691
Move aside! Move aside!

1987
02:10:57,857 --> 02:10:58,858
Come on, pull!

1988
02:11:00,026 --> 02:11:01,069
Pull!

1989
02:11:01,945 --> 02:11:03,225
Move aside! Quickly! Move aside!

1990
02:11:03,321 --> 02:11:05,323
-Put that down!
-Move aside!

1991
02:11:05,490 --> 02:11:07,117
-Put that down! Stop it!
-One!

1992
02:11:07,283 --> 02:11:08,743
-Stop that!
-Two! Three!

1993
02:11:11,496 --> 02:11:12,497
Again!

1994
02:11:14,541 --> 02:11:15,667
Yeah, let's go!

1995
02:11:18,294 --> 02:11:19,295
Let's go Rose.

1996
02:11:19,504 --> 02:11:21,297
You can't go out there!
You can't do this!

1997
02:11:26,553 --> 02:11:27,913
Move back as much as you can!

1998
02:11:28,013 --> 02:11:29,723
Keep order! Keep order here!

1999
02:11:30,056 --> 02:11:32,225
Back. Get back. Back.

2000
02:11:37,397 --> 02:11:38,523
Hold on to her!

2001
02:11:39,983 --> 02:11:41,443
Pull her in!

2002
02:11:41,943 --> 02:11:44,070
Get back, I say!

2003
02:11:44,237 --> 02:11:46,823
Or I'll shoot you all like dogs!

2004
02:11:46,990 --> 02:11:48,116
Keep order here!

2005
02:11:49,617 --> 02:11:51,411
Keep order, I say!

2006
02:11:52,829 --> 02:11:54,998
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

2007
02:11:59,544 --> 02:12:01,880
Right. Is everybody all right?

2008
02:12:02,297 --> 02:12:03,715
Nobody panic.

2009
02:12:09,721 --> 02:12:10,764
Stay back!

2010
02:12:11,973 --> 02:12:12,974
We're too late!

2011
02:12:13,141 --> 02:12:14,768
There are more boats down the front.

2012
02:12:15,185 --> 02:12:16,644
Stay with this one, Murdoch.

2013
02:12:16,811 --> 02:12:18,271
He seems to be quite practical.

2014
02:12:23,068 --> 02:12:24,319
Don't lower it!

2015
02:12:24,903 --> 02:12:26,154
Cut the falls!

2016
02:12:33,119 --> 02:12:34,871
Sit down! Hey!

2017
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:36,623
Stay back, you lot!

2018
02:12:36,790 --> 02:12:37,957
Just stay back!

2019
02:12:38,208 --> 02:12:39,459
Stay back, the lot of you.

2020
02:12:39,626 --> 02:12:40,627
Stay back!

2021
02:12:43,213 --> 02:12:45,340
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

2022
02:12:47,634 --> 02:12:48,760
Mr. Murdoch?

2023
02:12:48,927 --> 02:12:51,888
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!

2024
02:12:52,055 --> 02:12:53,431
I'm a businessman, as you know.

2025
02:12:53,598 --> 02:12:55,278
And I have a business proposition for you.

2026
02:13:03,108 --> 02:13:04,109
Come on, Rose.

2027
02:13:07,737 --> 02:13:08,738
The boats are gone!

2028
02:13:14,494 --> 02:13:16,174
Colonel, are there any boats on that side?

2029
02:13:16,246 --> 02:13:17,223
No, miss, but there are

2030
02:13:17,247 --> 02:13:18,599
a couple of boats all the way forward.

2031
02:13:18,623 --> 02:13:19,749
This way, I'll lead you.

2032
02:13:26,673 --> 02:13:27,650
What's the use?

2033
02:13:27,674 --> 02:13:29,342
Nobody's listening to us, anyway.

2034
02:13:30,010 --> 02:13:31,930
Well, they don't listen to us at dinner, either.

2035
02:13:32,345 --> 02:13:33,847
Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.

2036
02:13:35,306 --> 02:13:36,307
"Orpheus."

2037
02:13:41,521 --> 02:13:42,647
Music to drown by.

2038
02:13:42,814 --> 02:13:44,399
Now I know I'm in first class.

2039
02:13:46,609 --> 02:13:48,278
Keep along. Keep going.

2040
02:13:49,821 --> 02:13:51,031
Where is everyone?

2041
02:13:51,197 --> 02:13:52,741
They're all still aft, sir.

2042
02:13:52,949 --> 02:13:55,035
Come on, madam.
Don't cry. Come on.

2043
02:13:55,201 --> 02:13:57,620
Do we have an understanding,
then, Mr. Murdoch?

2044
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:04,961
Stand back!

2045
02:14:08,798 --> 02:14:11,092
Will the men please hold back?

2046
02:14:11,259 --> 02:14:12,510
Hold back, I say!

2047
02:14:15,347 --> 02:14:17,849
Women and children only!

2048
02:14:18,099 --> 02:14:19,309
Stand back!

2049
02:14:19,476 --> 02:14:21,353
Step back, sir. Come through, madam.

2050
02:14:21,728 --> 02:14:23,188
This way. Step back, sir.

2051
02:14:23,521 --> 02:14:24,498
Let the women through!

2052
02:14:24,522 --> 02:14:25,802
You better check the other side.

2053
02:14:25,899 --> 02:14:27,400
-Stand back, sir.
-Go!

2054
02:14:27,567 --> 02:14:28,943
Stand back, sir.

2055
02:14:29,819 --> 02:14:32,322
Any more women and children?

2056
02:14:33,156 --> 02:14:34,824
Any children?

2057
02:14:34,991 --> 02:14:36,659
I found her on the other side.

2058
02:14:37,327 --> 02:14:38,703
Waiting for a boat

2059
02:14:39,204 --> 02:14:40,205
with him.

2060
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:42,910
Any more women and children?

2061
02:14:42,999 --> 02:14:44,279
They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

2062
02:14:44,417 --> 02:14:45,752
Anyone else then?

2063
02:14:46,878 --> 02:14:47,879
Hop on, sir. Hop on.

2064
02:14:48,088 --> 02:14:49,528
-Anyone else?
-Do hurry. Hurry along.

2065
02:14:53,718 --> 02:14:54,719
Stand by the falls.

2066
02:14:54,886 --> 02:14:56,805
-Quickly.
-Goddamn it all to hell.

2067
02:14:56,971 --> 02:14:57,972
That's it!

2068
02:15:00,016 --> 02:15:01,309
-Shit.
-Fire!

2069
02:15:02,977 --> 02:15:03,978
Sir!

2070
02:15:04,145 --> 02:15:05,605
Sir, you can't go through here.

2071
02:15:05,772 --> 02:15:06,812
Sir, you can't go through.

2072
02:15:09,442 --> 02:15:11,319
That's just splendid. Right.

2073
02:15:13,655 --> 02:15:14,656
Right.

2074
02:15:15,865 --> 02:15:17,033
Prepare to lower!

2075
02:15:19,619 --> 02:15:20,995
Ready on the left.

2076
02:15:27,460 --> 02:15:28,795
Take them down.

2077
02:15:33,883 --> 02:15:34,884
Keep it steady.

2078
02:15:37,721 --> 02:15:39,556
Both sides together. Steady.

2079
02:15:40,181 --> 02:15:41,266
Keep it steady.

2080
02:15:42,976 --> 02:15:44,144
Give her to me.

2081
02:15:44,310 --> 02:15:45,454
-Daddy!
-It'll be fine,

2082
02:15:45,478 --> 02:15:46,539
-darling.
-Take her.

2083
02:15:46,563 --> 02:15:47,814
-Don't you worry.
-Pull her up.

2084
02:15:47,981 --> 02:15:49,566
Daddy, get in the boat.

2085
02:15:49,733 --> 02:15:51,526
It's goodbye for a little while.

2086
02:15:51,693 --> 02:15:52,736
Only for a little while.

2087
02:15:53,445 --> 02:15:54,797
There'll be another boat for the daddies,

2088
02:15:54,821 --> 02:15:56,740
this boat's for the mummies
and the children.

2089
02:15:56,906 --> 02:15:59,034
You hold Mummy's hand and be
a good little girl.

2090
02:16:00,618 --> 02:16:01,661
I'm not going without you.

2091
02:16:01,828 --> 02:16:04,039
-No, you have to go, now.
-No, Jack.

2092
02:16:04,205 --> 02:16:05,182
Women and children only, please!

2093
02:16:05,206 --> 02:16:07,292
-Get in the boat, Rose.
-No, Jack.

2094
02:16:07,459 --> 02:16:09,377
Yes! Get on the boat!

2095
02:16:09,544 --> 02:16:11,254
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

2096
02:16:14,799 --> 02:16:17,052
Oh, my God, look at you.
You look a fright.

2097
02:16:18,178 --> 02:16:19,179
Here.

2098
02:16:20,805 --> 02:16:22,640
Put this on. Come on.

2099
02:16:22,891 --> 02:16:24,017
On the boat, please.

2100
02:16:24,559 --> 02:16:25,599
We'll pray for you.

2101
02:16:25,810 --> 02:16:26,787
Get on the boat.

2102
02:16:26,811 --> 02:16:28,411
Yes, we'll pray for you, darling.

2103
02:16:28,438 --> 02:16:29,939
Go on. I'll get the next one.

2104
02:16:30,357 --> 02:16:32,150
No, not without you.

2105
02:16:32,359 --> 02:16:34,277
I'll be all right. Listen, I'll be fine.

2106
02:16:34,486 --> 02:16:36,446
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

2107
02:16:36,696 --> 02:16:38,239
Now, go on. Get on.

2108
02:16:38,406 --> 02:16:39,383
I have an arrangement with an officer

2109
02:16:39,407 --> 02:16:40,617
on the other side of the ship.

2110
02:16:40,784 --> 02:16:41,993
Jack and I can get off safely.

2111
02:16:42,535 --> 02:16:43,536
Both of us.

2112
02:16:44,954 --> 02:16:47,499
See? I got my own boat to catch.

2113
02:16:47,665 --> 02:16:48,667
Come on, hurry.

2114
02:16:49,125 --> 02:16:50,126
They're almost full.

2115
02:16:51,461 --> 02:16:52,671
-Step aboard, miss.
-Go, go.

2116
02:16:52,921 --> 02:16:53,922
Come on, hurry.

2117
02:16:54,673 --> 02:16:55,691
Step aboard, please.

2118
02:16:55,715 --> 02:16:56,984
Be Daddy's good girl, all right?

2119
02:16:57,008 --> 02:16:58,569
-Step lively!
-You're my little sailor.

2120
02:16:58,593 --> 02:17:00,428
Keep back! Keep back, I say!

2121
02:17:00,637 --> 02:17:02,222
Clear the rail.

2122
02:17:02,722 --> 02:17:03,723
Clear the rail, please.

2123
02:17:04,933 --> 02:17:06,685
And lower away!

2124
02:17:07,435 --> 02:17:09,475
Lower away together!

2125
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:11,731
Lower slowly!

2126
02:17:12,273 --> 02:17:14,192
Keep going! Keep going!

2127
02:17:14,859 --> 02:17:16,903
And lower away evenly, lads.

2128
02:17:17,862 --> 02:17:20,073
Easy! Lower away!

2129
02:17:20,699 --> 02:17:22,409
-You're a good liar.
-And even away!

2130
02:17:22,742 --> 02:17:23,785
Almost as good as you.

2131
02:17:23,952 --> 02:17:27,205
Easy now! And lower away!

2132
02:17:28,039 --> 02:17:29,040
Steady!

2133
02:17:29,207 --> 02:17:30,917
-There's no...
-Easy!

2134
02:17:31,126 --> 02:17:32,446
There's no arrangement, is there?

2135
02:17:32,919 --> 02:17:33,962
Lower away!

2136
02:17:34,129 --> 02:17:35,880
-No, there is.
-Even!

2137
02:17:36,047 --> 02:17:37,527
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

2138
02:17:37,966 --> 02:17:39,259
And even away!

2139
02:17:39,926 --> 02:17:42,846
-I always win, Jack.
-And lower away evenly, lads!

2140
02:17:43,013 --> 02:17:44,055
One way or another.

2141
02:17:44,222 --> 02:17:46,725
Watch that turn!
Turn that boat!

2142
02:17:48,101 --> 02:17:49,102
Easy!

2143
02:17:50,186 --> 02:17:51,271
Even, lads!

2144
02:17:52,355 --> 02:17:54,399
Keep going! Keep going!

2145
02:17:55,233 --> 02:17:56,234
Steady!

2146
02:17:58,486 --> 02:17:59,487
And even away!

2147
02:18:00,572 --> 02:18:01,573
Lower away!

2148
02:18:03,616 --> 02:18:04,617
Steady!

2149
02:18:42,864 --> 02:18:43,864
Rose!

2150
02:18:46,201 --> 02:18:47,577
-Stop her!
-Rose!

2151
02:18:47,744 --> 02:18:49,144
-What are you doing?
-Stop her!

2152
02:18:50,789 --> 02:18:51,873
No!

2153
02:19:10,225 --> 02:19:11,226
Rose!

2154
02:19:14,771 --> 02:19:16,231
You're so stupid!

2155
02:19:16,398 --> 02:19:17,482
Why'd you do that, huh?

2156
02:19:18,149 --> 02:19:19,442
You're so stupid, Rose.

2157
02:19:21,486 --> 02:19:22,904
Why did you do that? Why?

2158
02:19:24,072 --> 02:19:25,657
You jump, I jump, right?

2159
02:19:28,201 --> 02:19:29,202
All right.

2160
02:19:31,454 --> 02:19:33,331
Oh, God! I couldn't go.

2161
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:35,125
I couldn't go, Jack.

2162
02:19:35,792 --> 02:19:37,632
It's all right.
We'll think of something.

2163
02:19:39,212 --> 02:19:40,189
At least I'm with you.

2164
02:19:40,213 --> 02:19:41,453
We'll think of something.

2165
02:19:54,894 --> 02:19:55,895
Come on!

2166
02:19:57,355 --> 02:19:58,356
Come on! Come on!

2167
02:19:59,566 --> 02:20:00,608
Come on! Move!

2168
02:20:07,407 --> 02:20:08,408
Come on!

2169
02:20:16,708 --> 02:20:17,709
Move!

2170
02:20:23,798 --> 02:20:24,841
Come on, come on, Rose!

2171
02:20:25,967 --> 02:20:26,968
Come on!

2172
02:20:27,844 --> 02:20:28,970
Move! Come on!

2173
02:20:31,723 --> 02:20:32,849
Move, Rose!

2174
02:20:36,353 --> 02:20:37,354
Go!

2175
02:20:47,739 --> 02:20:49,824
I hope you enjoy your time together!

2176
02:21:04,506 --> 02:21:06,132
What could possibly be funny?

2177
02:21:07,258 --> 02:21:09,344
I put the diamond in the coat.

2178
02:21:12,597 --> 02:21:14,015
And I put the coat on her!

2179
02:21:16,267 --> 02:21:17,268
Come on!

2180
02:21:33,702 --> 02:21:34,703
Dada!

2181
02:21:36,621 --> 02:21:39,207
Dada!

2182
02:21:40,417 --> 02:21:42,627
-Dada!
-We can't leave him.

2183
02:21:43,336 --> 02:21:44,546
Dada!

2184
02:21:47,132 --> 02:21:48,174
All right, come on!

2185
02:21:50,218 --> 02:21:52,345
Dada!

2186
02:22:05,483 --> 02:22:06,693
Go back!

2187
02:22:06,943 --> 02:22:10,071
Dada! Dada!

2188
02:22:17,162 --> 02:22:18,180
It's the wrong way! Come back!

2189
02:22:18,204 --> 02:22:19,682
-No! Not that way!
-You're going the wrong way!

2190
02:22:19,706 --> 02:22:21,207
-Come back!
-Come back! Stop!

2191
02:22:26,338 --> 02:22:27,339
Go!

2192
02:22:29,674 --> 02:22:30,675
Go!

2193
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:33,094
Run!

2194
02:22:45,065 --> 02:22:46,649
-Jack!
-Rose!

2195
02:22:59,329 --> 02:23:00,372
This way!

2196
02:23:09,798 --> 02:23:10,799
Come on!

2197
02:23:12,425 --> 02:23:13,426
Give me your hand!

2198
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:23,561
Oh, God!

2199
02:23:28,316 --> 02:23:29,317
Help!

2200
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:36,241
Help!

2201
02:23:38,326 --> 02:23:40,662
Wait, sir! Sir, open the gate, please!

2202
02:23:40,829 --> 02:23:42,080
-Help us, please!
-Please!

2203
02:23:42,455 --> 02:23:43,456
Help us!

2204
02:23:43,623 --> 02:23:45,000
-Please!
-Please!

2205
02:23:46,459 --> 02:23:47,460
Bloody hell!

2206
02:23:50,922 --> 02:23:51,923
Hurry!

2207
02:23:53,508 --> 02:23:55,218
-God, come on!
-Come on!

2208
02:23:55,969 --> 02:23:56,988
Go, go!

2209
02:23:57,012 --> 02:23:58,096
Oh, Jesus!

2210
02:23:59,139 --> 02:24:00,515
-Please!
-Come on!

2211
02:24:00,890 --> 02:24:01,891
Hurry!

2212
02:24:02,434 --> 02:24:03,435
Come on!

2213
02:24:08,690 --> 02:24:10,316
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

2214
02:24:11,401 --> 02:24:12,902
-Wait, please!
-Wait!

2215
02:24:13,737 --> 02:24:14,988
Don't leave!

2216
02:24:15,155 --> 02:24:17,782
Please! Send for help! No!

2217
02:24:35,175 --> 02:24:36,152
I got it!

2218
02:24:36,176 --> 02:24:37,536
-Which one is it, Rose?
-All right!

2219
02:24:37,844 --> 02:24:39,164
The short one, try the short one.

2220
02:24:40,555 --> 02:24:41,556
Hurry, Jack.

2221
02:24:45,143 --> 02:24:46,853
Oh, no! It won't go in!

2222
02:24:47,771 --> 02:24:48,772
Hurry, Jack.

2223
02:24:51,274 --> 02:24:53,318
-It's stuck! It's stuck!
-Come on, Jack! Hurry.

2224
02:24:53,693 --> 02:24:56,279
-Jack! Hurry, Jack!
-Come on!

2225
02:24:57,864 --> 02:24:59,699
-Hurry, Jack!
-Go on!

2226
02:24:59,908 --> 02:25:00,909
Jack!

2227
02:25:02,202 --> 02:25:04,120
I got it! I got it! Go! Go, Rose!

2228
02:25:05,372 --> 02:25:07,665
Go! Go! Move!

2229
02:25:08,917 --> 02:25:09,918
Jack!

2230
02:25:16,966 --> 02:25:18,051
Jack!

2231
02:25:19,052 --> 02:25:20,303
Jack!

2232
02:25:20,470 --> 02:25:21,471
Come on!

2233
02:25:23,348 --> 02:25:24,349
Move, move.

2234
02:25:33,817 --> 02:25:35,819
-Keep on working!
-Get the oars in place.

2235
02:25:36,069 --> 02:25:37,349
Get an oar under it!

2236
02:25:38,196 --> 02:25:40,407
Women and children only, damn you!

2237
02:25:40,615 --> 02:25:42,742
Hold it! Hold it!

2238
02:25:42,909 --> 02:25:44,202
Hold it!

2239
02:25:55,046 --> 02:25:57,382
Get these davits cranked in!

2240
02:25:57,549 --> 02:25:59,134
And get the falls hooked up!

2241
02:25:59,926 --> 02:26:01,052
Oh!

2242
02:26:08,309 --> 02:26:09,310
Stay back!

2243
02:26:11,396 --> 02:26:13,064
Mommy!

2244
02:26:16,276 --> 02:26:17,652
Stay back, I say!

2245
02:26:19,779 --> 02:26:20,780
Keep going up!

2246
02:26:23,992 --> 02:26:25,160
Stop pushing!

2247
02:26:27,829 --> 02:26:28,830
Stay back!

2248
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:31,624
Will you give us a chance to live,
you limey bastard!

2249
02:26:31,791 --> 02:26:34,544
I'll shoot any man who tries to get past me!
Get back!

2250
02:26:34,711 --> 02:26:35,712
Bastard!

2251
02:26:36,046 --> 02:26:37,213
Get back!

2252
02:26:37,964 --> 02:26:38,965
We had a deal, damn you!

2253
02:26:40,925 --> 02:26:42,260
Any more women and children?

2254
02:26:42,427 --> 02:26:45,972
Your money can't save you
any more than it could me. Get back!

2255
02:26:47,849 --> 02:26:49,267
Women and children only!

2256
02:26:56,191 --> 02:26:57,442
Tommy!

2257
02:26:57,609 --> 02:26:59,152
No, no! No, Tommy!

2258
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:06,201
Oh, no!

2259
02:27:18,713 --> 02:27:19,714
No, Will!

2260
02:27:26,554 --> 02:27:28,056
Now stand back, damn you!

2261
02:27:28,765 --> 02:27:29,766
God damn you!

2262
02:27:31,518 --> 02:27:34,104
Gently! Hold it.
Hold it, hold it!

2263
02:27:44,781 --> 02:27:45,824
I have a child!

2264
02:27:46,658 --> 02:27:48,702
-I have a child!
-Clear a path here!

2265
02:27:49,285 --> 02:27:50,537
Please, I have a child!

2266
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:54,165
Please. I'm all she has in the world.

2267
02:27:55,458 --> 02:27:56,751
Go on.

2268
02:27:56,918 --> 02:27:58,920
-Step back! Step back, I say!
-Please?

2269
02:27:59,087 --> 02:28:00,630
Here. Give her to me.

2270
02:28:00,797 --> 02:28:02,007
You're all right, dearie.

2271
02:28:04,801 --> 02:28:05,885
Give her here.

2272
02:28:07,846 --> 02:28:08,930
There, there.

2273
02:28:13,351 --> 02:28:14,769
Wait, wait, wait!

2274
02:28:14,936 --> 02:28:16,146
Mr. Andrews!

2275
02:28:18,565 --> 02:28:19,607
Oh, Rose.

2276
02:28:22,694 --> 02:28:24,014
Won't you even make a try for it?

2277
02:28:25,989 --> 02:28:29,951
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

2278
02:28:32,412 --> 02:28:34,330
It's going fast. We have to move.

2279
02:28:34,914 --> 02:28:35,915
Wait.

2280
02:28:39,085 --> 02:28:40,128
Good luck to you, Rose.

2281
02:28:42,630 --> 02:28:43,631
And to you.

2282
02:28:56,394 --> 02:28:57,395
Mr. Guggenheim?

2283
02:28:57,979 --> 02:28:59,165
These are for you, Mr. Guggenheim.

2284
02:28:59,189 --> 02:29:00,273
No, thank you.

2285
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:01,792
We are dressed in our best

2286
02:29:01,816 --> 02:29:03,651
and are prepared to go down as gentlemen.

2287
02:29:05,362 --> 02:29:06,738
But we would like a brandy.

2288
02:29:08,198 --> 02:29:09,798
Get the falls over here now!

2289
02:29:10,992 --> 02:29:13,161
Let them drop. Then we'll right it.

2290
02:29:20,877 --> 02:29:22,712
Where should I go? Please.

2291
02:29:28,468 --> 02:29:29,469
Captain.

2292
02:29:30,136 --> 02:29:31,680
Captain. Sir.

2293
02:30:02,627 --> 02:30:04,045
Right. That's it, then.

2294
02:30:05,714 --> 02:30:06,923
Goodbye, Wally. Good luck.

2295
02:30:08,049 --> 02:30:09,529
-Goodbye, Wallace.
-So long, old chap.

2296
02:31:24,626 --> 02:31:28,713
And so they lived happily together
for 300 years

2297
02:31:29,464 --> 02:31:31,132
in the land of Tír na nÓg

2298
02:31:32,550 --> 02:31:34,678
land of eternal youth and beauty.

2299
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:13,633
There's no time! Cut those falls!

2300
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:15,927
Cut 'em! Cut 'em if you have to!

2301
02:32:16,886 --> 02:32:19,222
I need a knife! I need a knife!

2302
02:32:20,974 --> 02:32:22,559
Bloody cut the falls now!

2303
02:32:23,268 --> 02:32:24,269
Cut 'em loose!

2304
02:32:33,153 --> 02:32:34,487
Cut the falls!

2305
02:32:35,613 --> 02:32:37,157
Cut those bloody falls!

2306
02:32:41,995 --> 02:32:42,996
Here.

2307
02:32:54,716 --> 02:32:55,717
Now!

2308
02:33:24,913 --> 02:33:25,914
Gentlemen,

2309
02:33:26,664 --> 02:33:28,584
it has been a privilege playing
with you tonight.

2310
02:34:29,853 --> 02:34:32,230
We have to stay on the ship
as long as possible. Come on.

2311
02:34:45,118 --> 02:34:46,494
This way. Through the rail.

2312
02:34:48,955 --> 02:34:50,373
Come on, Rose.

2313
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:51,541
Jump.

2314
02:34:53,168 --> 02:34:54,544
Come on, come on.

2315
02:34:56,129 --> 02:34:59,483
Help! Help us!

2316
02:35:28,328 --> 02:35:29,704
I got you. Jump.

2317
02:35:32,707 --> 02:35:34,067
I've got you, miss.

2318
02:35:35,043 --> 02:35:36,252
-Jack!
-Come on.

2319
02:35:38,421 --> 02:35:39,798
-Back!
-Help me!

2320
02:35:42,842 --> 02:35:44,042
Give me your hand.

2321
02:36:05,281 --> 02:36:06,366
Hang on, sailor.

2322
02:36:09,786 --> 02:36:11,329
No! You'll swamp us.

2323
02:36:21,881 --> 02:36:22,882
Move.

2324
02:36:24,384 --> 02:36:26,362
"Yea, though I walk through the valley

2325
02:36:26,386 --> 02:36:27,697
"of the shadow of death, I will fear no..."

2326
02:36:27,721 --> 02:36:30,223
You wanna walk a little faster
through that valley there?

2327
02:36:53,204 --> 02:36:54,205
Row!

2328
02:36:54,998 --> 02:36:55,999
Pull together!

2329
02:36:58,335 --> 02:36:59,961
Jump down, swim to the boats!

2330
02:37:20,440 --> 02:37:21,816
Holy Mary, mother of God,

2331
02:37:22,067 --> 02:37:23,210
pray for us sinners now

2332
02:37:23,234 --> 02:37:25,195
and at the hour of our death. Amen.

2333
02:37:25,945 --> 02:37:27,489
-Hail Mary, full of grace.
-This way.

2334
02:37:27,655 --> 02:37:29,449
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou...

2335
02:37:38,667 --> 02:37:40,335
Come on. Come on.

2336
02:37:50,178 --> 02:37:52,430
"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth,

2337
02:37:52,931 --> 02:37:55,767
"when the first heaven and first earth
had passed away

2338
02:37:57,644 --> 02:37:59,104
"and there was no more sea."

2339
02:38:03,024 --> 02:38:04,025
Where are you?

2340
02:38:04,984 --> 02:38:06,528
-Help me!
-It'll be over soon.

2341
02:38:07,487 --> 02:38:08,738
It'll all be over soon.

2342
02:38:08,947 --> 02:38:11,282
"And I heard a voice suddenly...

2343
02:38:11,449 --> 02:38:14,411
"Behold, the tabernacle of God is with man,

2344
02:38:14,577 --> 02:38:18,123
"and He shall dwell with them and they
shall be His people

2345
02:38:18,289 --> 02:38:20,375
"and God Himself shall be with them

2346
02:38:20,583 --> 02:38:21,751
"and be their God."

2347
02:38:22,961 --> 02:38:24,379
Jack.

2348
02:38:25,046 --> 02:38:26,464
This is where we first met.

2349
02:38:33,847 --> 02:38:36,641
"And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes

2350
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:39,144
"and there shall be no more death.

2351
02:38:40,353 --> 02:38:42,689
"Neither shall there be sorrow or crying.

2352
02:38:43,189 --> 02:38:44,983
"Neither shall there be any more pain,

2353
02:38:46,484 --> 02:38:49,654
"for the former world has passed away."

2354
02:39:03,668 --> 02:39:06,004
Bloody pull faster and pull.

2355
02:39:10,884 --> 02:39:11,964
Help me!

2356
02:39:29,152 --> 02:39:30,755
Hang on, Miss Trudy!

2357
02:39:59,808 --> 02:40:02,644
Help me. Please, save me.

2358
02:40:05,522 --> 02:40:07,440
-Help!
-Hold on real tight.

2359
02:40:08,066 --> 02:40:09,401
Help me, please!

2360
02:40:25,625 --> 02:40:26,876
God Almighty.

2361
02:40:34,634 --> 02:40:37,137
Keep those breakers in. Keep them in!

2362
02:41:56,299 --> 02:41:57,467
We have to move.

2363
02:42:03,682 --> 02:42:04,659
Give me your hand.

2364
02:42:04,683 --> 02:42:05,785
-I'll pull you over.
-I can't.

2365
02:42:05,809 --> 02:42:07,644
Come on. Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

2366
02:42:10,188 --> 02:42:12,023
I've got you. I won't let go.

2367
02:42:12,649 --> 02:42:13,650
Come on, I've got you.

2368
02:42:25,203 --> 02:42:26,621
What's happening, Jack?

2369
02:42:26,788 --> 02:42:28,206
I don't know. I don't know.

2370
02:42:37,215 --> 02:42:39,300
-Hold on. Come on, Rose.
-Jack!

2371
02:42:40,593 --> 02:42:41,821
Help me, please!

2372
02:42:41,845 --> 02:42:43,888
Someone, help me, please!

2373
02:43:06,703 --> 02:43:08,288
Help! Help, help!

2374
02:43:08,455 --> 02:43:09,873
Help!

2375
02:43:20,925 --> 02:43:22,010
This is it.

2376
02:43:34,606 --> 02:43:36,524
Oh, my God, Jack. Oh, God.

2377
02:43:37,025 --> 02:43:39,069
-Oh, God.
-Hold on!

2378
02:43:39,778 --> 02:43:41,654
Oh, God. Oh.

2379
02:43:54,334 --> 02:43:55,794
The ship is gonna suck us down.

2380
02:43:56,961 --> 02:43:58,630
Take a deep breath when I say.

2381
02:44:04,219 --> 02:44:06,221
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.

2382
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:08,306
Do not let go of my hand.

2383
02:44:10,308 --> 02:44:11,309
No!

2384
02:44:12,018 --> 02:44:13,019
No!

2385
02:44:15,563 --> 02:44:16,731
We're gonna make it, Rose.

2386
02:44:17,107 --> 02:44:18,149
Trust me.

2387
02:44:18,316 --> 02:44:19,317
I trust you!

2388
02:44:24,322 --> 02:44:25,949
Ready! Ready!

2389
02:44:26,741 --> 02:44:27,781
Now!

2390
02:45:04,362 --> 02:45:06,072
Jack! Jack!

2391
02:45:06,948 --> 02:45:07,991
Jack!

2392
02:45:08,324 --> 02:45:09,576
Help me! Help!

2393
02:45:10,410 --> 02:45:11,411
Jack!

2394
02:45:16,374 --> 02:45:18,293
Jack! Jack!

2395
02:45:20,128 --> 02:45:21,129
Jack!

2396
02:45:22,005 --> 02:45:23,131
Jack!

2397
02:45:37,937 --> 02:45:39,356
Jack! Jack!

2398
02:45:44,152 --> 02:45:45,153
No!

2399
02:45:47,364 --> 02:45:48,365
Jack!

2400
02:45:49,157 --> 02:45:50,158
Rose!

2401
02:45:50,325 --> 02:45:51,368
Get off her!

2402
02:45:51,534 --> 02:45:52,911
Get off her!

2403
02:45:55,997 --> 02:45:57,248
-Rose.
-Jack.

2404
02:45:57,415 --> 02:45:59,209
Swim, Rose. I need you to swim.

2405
02:46:03,672 --> 02:46:04,673
Keep swimming.

2406
02:46:09,469 --> 02:46:11,137
-It's so cold.
-Swim, Rose.

2407
02:46:16,643 --> 02:46:17,644
Come on.

2408
02:46:18,019 --> 02:46:19,020
Here.

2409
02:46:19,896 --> 02:46:20,897
Keep swimming.

2410
02:46:21,356 --> 02:46:22,524
Come on.

2411
02:46:24,567 --> 02:46:26,111
Here, get on it.

2412
02:46:27,612 --> 02:46:28,697
Get on top.

2413
02:46:36,454 --> 02:46:37,497
Come on, Rose.

2414
02:46:47,549 --> 02:46:49,300
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

2415
02:46:49,843 --> 02:46:50,844
Jack.

2416
02:46:57,684 --> 02:46:58,685
No.

2417
02:47:11,031 --> 02:47:12,073
It'll be all right now.

2418
02:47:15,035 --> 02:47:16,036
It'll be all right now.

2419
02:47:16,202 --> 02:47:17,263
Oh, God!

2420
02:47:24,002 --> 02:47:25,253
Return

2421
02:47:25,503 --> 02:47:26,796
the boats!

2422
02:47:31,092 --> 02:47:32,761
The boats are coming back for us, Rose.

2423
02:47:33,887 --> 02:47:35,305
Hold on just a little bit longer.

2424
02:47:36,014 --> 02:47:37,182
Return the boats!

2425
02:47:37,557 --> 02:47:41,102
They had to row away for the suction,
but now they'll be coming back.

2426
02:47:44,105 --> 02:47:45,374
For God's sake!

2427
02:47:45,398 --> 02:47:47,317
-Help us!
-Please!

2428
02:47:47,484 --> 02:47:48,735
Help us!

2429
02:47:50,153 --> 02:47:51,237
Come back!

2430
02:47:54,074 --> 02:47:55,367
You don't understand.

2431
02:47:56,576 --> 02:47:58,703
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.

2432
02:47:58,870 --> 02:48:00,590
They'll pull us right down,
I'm telling you.

2433
02:48:00,830 --> 02:48:03,416
Knock it off. You're scaring me.

2434
02:48:03,583 --> 02:48:06,378
Come on, girls. Grab an oar. Let's go.

2435
02:48:06,544 --> 02:48:07,897
Are you out of your mind?

2436
02:48:07,921 --> 02:48:09,631
We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.

2437
02:48:10,006 --> 02:48:12,550
Now, do you people want
to live or do you want to die?

2438
02:48:20,266 --> 02:48:21,810
I don't understand a one of you.

2439
02:48:24,270 --> 02:48:25,647
What's the matter with you?

2440
02:48:25,814 --> 02:48:27,565
It's your men out there.

2441
02:48:30,318 --> 02:48:31,986
There's plenty of room for more.

2442
02:48:32,153 --> 02:48:33,822
And there'll be one less on this boat

2443
02:48:34,197 --> 02:48:37,575
if you don't shut that hole in your face!

2444
02:48:51,798 --> 02:48:53,133
Here, take this rope.

2445
02:48:53,299 --> 02:48:54,939
Now, bring in your oars over there.

2446
02:48:55,093 --> 02:48:57,012
And tie these two boats together as well.

2447
02:49:01,850 --> 02:49:03,727
Now make sure that's tied up
nice and tight.

2448
02:49:07,939 --> 02:49:10,316
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

2449
02:49:10,650 --> 02:49:12,003
I wanna transfer all the women

2450
02:49:12,027 --> 02:49:13,862
from this boat into that boat right now.

2451
02:49:14,029 --> 02:49:15,530
As quick as you can, please.

2452
02:49:15,697 --> 02:49:17,049
Let's create some space over there.

2453
02:49:17,073 --> 02:49:18,199
Move forward and aft.

2454
02:49:28,209 --> 02:49:29,336
It's getting quiet.

2455
02:49:32,213 --> 02:49:34,591
It's just gonna take a couple of minutes

2456
02:49:36,051 --> 02:49:37,344
to get the boats organized.

2457
02:49:40,805 --> 02:49:42,015
I don't know about you

2458
02:49:42,766 --> 02:49:43,933
but I intend to

2459
02:49:44,351 --> 02:49:46,519
write a strongly worded letter

2460
02:49:46,853 --> 02:49:49,689
to the White Star Line about all this.

2461
02:49:56,613 --> 02:49:57,781
I love you, Jack.

2462
02:50:04,996 --> 02:50:06,081
Don't you do that.

2463
02:50:07,999 --> 02:50:09,501
Don't you say your goodbyes.

2464
02:50:10,168 --> 02:50:11,169
Not yet.

2465
02:50:11,336 --> 02:50:12,754
Do you understand me?

2466
02:50:13,505 --> 02:50:14,673
I'm so cold.

2467
02:50:15,757 --> 02:50:16,800
Listen, Rose.

2468
02:50:18,301 --> 02:50:19,461
You're gonna get out of here.

2469
02:50:21,096 --> 02:50:22,097
You're gonna go on

2470
02:50:23,807 --> 02:50:25,767
and you're gonna make lots of babies

2471
02:50:26,643 --> 02:50:28,103
and you're gonna watch them grow.

2472
02:50:30,271 --> 02:50:32,899
You're gonna die an old lady

2473
02:50:33,066 --> 02:50:34,150
warm in her bed.

2474
02:50:36,486 --> 02:50:37,487
Not here.

2475
02:50:38,363 --> 02:50:39,364
Not this night.

2476
02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:42,242
Not like this. Do you understand me?

2477
02:50:45,995 --> 02:50:47,539
I can't feel my body.

2478
02:50:49,833 --> 02:50:50,977
Winning that ticket, Rose,

2479
02:50:51,001 --> 02:50:53,169
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

2480
02:50:55,547 --> 02:50:56,715
It brought me to you.

2481
02:50:59,217 --> 02:51:00,927
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.

2482
02:51:02,012 --> 02:51:03,138
I'm thankful.

2483
02:51:09,269 --> 02:51:10,645
You must do me this honor.

2484
02:51:14,232 --> 02:51:16,985
You must promise me that you'll survive.

2485
02:51:18,570 --> 02:51:20,989
That you won't give up,

2486
02:51:22,365 --> 02:51:23,867
no matter what happens.

2487
02:51:26,911 --> 02:51:28,663
No matter how hopeless.

2488
02:51:32,709 --> 02:51:34,085
Promise me, now, Rose.

2489
02:51:37,005 --> 02:51:38,673
And never let go of that promise.

2490
02:51:41,051 --> 02:51:42,093
I promise.

2491
02:51:44,554 --> 02:51:45,638
Never let go.

2492
02:51:48,975 --> 02:51:50,352
I will never let go, Jack.

2493
02:51:53,855 --> 02:51:54,981
I'll never let go.

2494
02:52:19,589 --> 02:52:20,590
Right ahead, sir.

2495
02:52:24,260 --> 02:52:25,303
Oars!

2496
02:52:26,179 --> 02:52:27,389
Do you see any moving?

2497
02:52:28,890 --> 02:52:30,850
No, sir. None moving, sir.

2498
02:52:31,434 --> 02:52:32,477
Check them.

2499
02:52:33,144 --> 02:52:34,145
Bring that oar up here.

2500
02:52:41,236 --> 02:52:42,529
Check them. Make sure.

2501
02:52:43,530 --> 02:52:44,781
These are dead, sir.

2502
02:52:45,573 --> 02:52:47,951
Now, give way. Ahead easy.

2503
02:52:55,250 --> 02:52:57,919
Careful with your oars. Don't hit them.

2504
02:53:00,839 --> 02:53:02,507
Is there anyone alive out there?

2505
02:53:04,759 --> 02:53:06,011
Can anyone hear me?

2506
02:53:08,805 --> 02:53:10,515
Is there anyone alive out there?

2507
02:53:17,981 --> 02:53:19,190
We waited too long.

2508
02:53:23,653 --> 02:53:25,780
Well, keep checking them!
Keep looking!

2509
02:53:27,574 --> 02:53:29,784
Is there anyone alive out there?

2510
02:53:33,538 --> 02:53:35,123
Can anyone hear me?

2511
02:53:46,259 --> 02:53:49,137

2517
02:54:34,349 --> 02:54:36,059
Can anyone hear me?

2518
02:54:39,479 --> 02:54:40,480
Jack.

2519
02:54:45,652 --> 02:54:46,653
Jack.

2520
02:54:49,614 --> 02:54:50,615
Jack.

2521
02:54:58,665 --> 02:54:59,666
Jack.

2522
02:55:00,417 --> 02:55:01,418
There's a boat.

2523
02:55:02,335 --> 02:55:03,336
Jack.

2524
02:55:14,848 --> 02:55:15,849
Jack.

2525
02:55:17,058 --> 02:55:18,059
Jack.

2526
02:55:20,145 --> 02:55:21,146
Jack!

2527
02:55:24,816 --> 02:55:25,817
Jack.

2528
02:55:28,778 --> 02:55:30,238
There's a boat, Jack.

2529
02:55:33,533 --> 02:55:34,534
Jack.

2530
02:56:14,491 --> 02:56:15,492
Come back.

2531
02:56:17,035 --> 02:56:19,162
-Come back.
-Can anyone hear me?

2532
02:56:20,538 --> 02:56:21,539
Come back.

2533
02:56:23,416 --> 02:56:24,751
Come back.

2534
02:56:25,502 --> 02:56:27,629
Come back.

2535
02:56:27,837 --> 02:56:29,839
Come back. Come back.

2536
02:56:31,591 --> 02:56:33,385
Hello!

2537
02:56:34,761 --> 02:56:36,805
Can anyone hear me?

2538
02:56:37,681 --> 02:56:39,041
There's nothing here, sir.

2539
02:56:41,685 --> 02:56:43,978
-Come back.
-Can anyone hear me?

2540
02:56:44,688 --> 02:56:45,689
Come back.

2541
02:56:53,738 --> 02:56:55,240
I'll never let go.

2542
02:56:55,407 --> 02:56:56,449
I promise.

2543
02:57:40,243 --> 02:57:41,721
Come about!

2544
02:58:03,099 --> 02:58:06,394
Fifteen-hundred people
went into the sea

2545
02:58:07,395 --> 02:58:09,898
when <i>Titanic</i> sank from under us.

2546
02:58:12,192 --> 02:58:14,819
There were 20 boats floating nearby

2547
02:58:16,404 --> 02:58:18,281
and only one came back.

2548
02:58:20,658 --> 02:58:21,701
One.

2549
02:58:23,536 --> 02:58:25,580
Six were saved from the water,

2550
02:58:26,414 --> 02:58:27,749
myself included.

2551
02:58:29,250 --> 02:58:30,251
Six

2552
02:58:31,711 --> 02:58:33,880
out of 1,500.

2553
02:58:37,175 --> 02:58:38,259
Afterward...

2554
02:58:39,511 --> 02:58:43,932
the 700 people in the boats
had nothing to do but wait.

2555
02:58:46,226 --> 02:58:47,644
Wait to die,

2556
02:58:48,353 --> 02:58:49,396
wait to live.

2557
02:58:51,022 --> 02:58:52,524
Wait for an absolution

2558
02:58:53,525 --> 02:58:54,859
that would never come.

2559
02:59:59,883 --> 03:00:02,194
Sir, I don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

2560
03:00:02,218 --> 03:00:03,428
It's all steerage.

2561
03:00:06,264 --> 03:00:08,683
His hair is reddish brown,
reddish brown.

2562
03:00:08,850 --> 03:00:10,202
Reddish brown and a white beard.

2563
03:00:10,226 --> 03:00:11,394
Calm down, it's all right.

2564
03:00:11,561 --> 03:00:13,688
Isn't there another passenger list?

2565
03:00:13,855 --> 03:00:16,274
-There's no other list.
-Perhaps he's on another ship.

2566
03:00:16,649 --> 03:00:18,401
We're doing all we can, ma'am.

2567
03:00:18,610 --> 03:00:20,250
There's got to be another passenger list.

2568
03:00:42,133 --> 03:00:44,135
<i>That's the last time
I ever saw him.</i>

2569
03:00:45,053 --> 03:00:48,056
<i>He married, of course,
and inherited his millions.</i>

2570
03:00:49,307 --> 03:00:52,727
<i>But the Crash of '29 hit his
interests hard.</i>

2571
03:00:53,228 --> 03:00:55,563
<i>And he put a pistol
in his mouth that year.</i>

2572
03:00:56,231 --> 03:00:57,440
Or so I read.

2573
03:01:10,829 --> 03:01:12,229
Can I take your name, please, love?

2574
03:01:15,375 --> 03:01:16,376
Dawson.

2575
03:01:18,795 --> 03:01:19,879
Rose Dawson.

2576
03:01:21,548 --> 03:01:22,549
Thank you.

2577
03:01:29,764 --> 03:01:31,474
We never found anything on Jack.

2578
03:01:32,058 --> 03:01:33,977
There's no record of him at all.

2579
03:01:34,561 --> 03:01:36,271
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

2580
03:01:37,313 --> 03:01:39,733
And I've never spoken of him until now.

2581
03:01:40,775 --> 03:01:41,943
Not to anyone.

2582
03:01:42,944 --> 03:01:45,071
Not even your grandfather.

2583
03:01:45,238 --> 03:01:48,783
A woman's heart
is a deep ocean of secrets.

2584
03:01:50,160 --> 03:01:53,329
But now you know there was
a man named Jack Dawson,

2585
03:01:54,205 --> 03:01:56,249
and that he saved me

2586
03:01:56,416 --> 03:01:59,127
in every way that a person can be saved.

2587
03:02:01,796 --> 03:02:03,882
I don't even have a picture of him.

2588
03:02:07,010 --> 03:02:10,680
He exists now only in my memory.

2589
03:02:15,643 --> 03:02:18,605
Keldysh, Keldysh,
<i>Mir Two on our way to the surface.</i>

2590
03:02:35,705 --> 03:02:36,682
<i>You know, I was saving this</i>

2591
03:02:36,706 --> 03:02:38,458
<i>for when I found the diamond.</i>

2592
03:02:47,884 --> 03:02:48,927
I'm sorry.

2593
03:02:52,180 --> 03:02:53,348
Three years...

2594
03:02:54,182 --> 03:02:56,267
I've thought of nothing except <i>Titanic.</i>

2595
03:02:57,727 --> 03:02:58,978
But I never got it.

2596
03:03:02,649 --> 03:03:03,817
I never let it in.

2597
03:04:37,327 --> 03:04:38,453
Ha!

2598
03:14:37,848 --> 03:14:39,849
English
