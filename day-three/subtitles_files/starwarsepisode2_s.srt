1
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:19,219
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:21,471
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,983
We made it.

4
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:20,155
I guess I was wrong.

5
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:22,532
There was no danger at all.

6
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:43,011
Cordé.

7
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:47,265
Milady, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:50,268
I've failed you, Senator.

9
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:51,520
No.

10
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,192
Milady, you're still in danger here.

11
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:06,952
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

12
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:10,872
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

13
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,835
Senator Amidala, please.

14
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:29,558
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

15
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,186
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

16
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:35,105
If they do break away...

17
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,483
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

18
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,652
be split in two.

19
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:43,697
My negotiations will not fail.

20
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:46,366
If they do, you must realize...

21
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,577
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

22
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:52,205
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

23
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:55,417
Master Yoda...

24
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:59,045
do you think it will
really come to war?

25
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:04,843
The dark side clouds everything.

26
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:09,890
Impossible to see the future is.

27
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:14,936
<i>The Loyalist Committee</i>
<i>has arrived, Your Honour.</i>

28
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:16,062
Good.

29
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:20,775
Send them in.

30
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:23,737
We will discuss this matter later.

31
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,786
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform...

32
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:33,830
terrible.

33
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,667
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.

34
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:40,504
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

35
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,217
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

36
00:05:46,176 --> 00:05:48,220
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

37
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:52,182
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

38
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:55,268
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

39
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:58,855
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

40
00:05:59,022 --> 00:06:01,525
But for certain, Senator...

41
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:05,487
in grave danger you are.

42
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:09,533
Master Jedi, may I suggest...

43
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:13,745
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

44
00:06:13,912 --> 00:06:16,915
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

45
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:19,125
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe...

46
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:21,586
The situation is that serious?

47
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:24,172
No, but I do, Senator.

48
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:27,634
I realize all too well
that additional security...

49
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,179
might be disruptive for you...

50
00:06:31,346 --> 00:06:34,015
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

51
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:38,103
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

52
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,480
That's possible.

53
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:43,400
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

54
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:46,695
Do it for me, milady. Please?

55
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,155
The thought of losing you...

56
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,993
is unbearable.

57
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:57,038
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

58
00:06:57,164 --> 00:06:59,374
Thank you, Master Windu.

59
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,262
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.

60
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:16,016
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

61
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:18,768
You fell into that nightmare, Master...

62
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:21,271
and I rescued you, remember?

63
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,773
Oh... yes.

64
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,325
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

65
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,495
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

66
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:53,887
Obi? Obi!

67
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:57,682
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again, Jar Jar.

68
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,809
Senator Padmé.

69
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:03,522
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

70
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:06,316
Desa Jedi arriven.

71
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:12,906
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

72
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:15,492
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

73
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,286
Ani?

74
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:21,706
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

75
00:08:21,873 --> 00:08:24,209
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

76
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:27,045
Well, for a senator, I mean.

77
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:32,509
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

78
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:37,556
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

79
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:40,100
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

80
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,310
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

81
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:44,563
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

82
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:47,440
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

83
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:50,235
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

84
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,571
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

85
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:56,449
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

86
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,952
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

87
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,912
I promise you.

88
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:03,748
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

89
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:06,835
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

90
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,421
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

91
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:11,464
and you will pay attention
to my lead.

92
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:13,675
- Why?
- What?

93
00:09:15,594 --> 00:09:19,264
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

94
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:22,684
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.

95
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:25,645
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

96
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,024
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

97
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:34,529
And you will learn
your place, young one.

98
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,993
Perhaps with merely your presence...

99
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,079
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

100
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:45,749
Now, if you'll excuse me...

101
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,751
I will retire.

102
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:51,171
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

103
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:53,423
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...

104
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:55,675
and I'll be in the control centre
downstairs.

105
00:09:57,344 --> 00:10:00,347
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

106
00:10:00,472 --> 00:10:03,558
She hardly even
recognized me, Jar Jar.

107
00:10:05,227 --> 00:10:08,146
I've thought about her
every day since we parted and...

108
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:11,483
she's forgotten me completely.

109
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:13,235
Shesa happy.

110
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,695
Happier den mesa seein her
in a longo time.

111
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:19,616
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

112
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:22,369
She was pleased to see us.

113
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:24,496
Now, let's check the security.

114
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:35,590
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

115
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,926
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

116
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:40,053
My client is getting impatient.

117
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,056
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

118
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:46,601
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

119
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:52,315
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

120
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:54,359
No assassin would try that way.

121
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:57,487
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

122
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:01,908
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

123
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:05,537
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

124
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:08,248
I don't think she liked me
watching her.

125
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,292
What is she thinking?

126
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:13,420
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

127
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:16,089
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

128
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:20,552
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

129
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:24,764
You're using her as bait.

130
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,975
It was her idea.

131
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,603
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

132
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:32,689
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

133
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:35,066
Trust me.

134
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,110
It's too risky.

135
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:40,780
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

136
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,200
And yours are?

137
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,329
Possibly.

138
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:03,637
You look tired.

139
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:06,348
I don't sleep well any more.

140
00:12:06,473 --> 00:12:08,934
Because of your mother?

141
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:16,900
I don't know
why I keep dreaming about her.

142
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:21,571
Dreams pass in time.

143
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:25,700
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

144
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:29,996
Just being around her again is...
intoxicating.

145
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:32,582
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

146
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:35,001
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order...

147
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:37,212
a commitment not easily broken.

148
00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:40,090
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.

149
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:42,759
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

150
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:45,053
It is my experience
that senators focus...

151
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:48,014
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

152
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:52,310
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

153
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:54,604
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

154
00:12:54,771 --> 00:12:57,524
At least not
on the economics of politics.

155
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:55,874
And besides, you're generalizing.

156
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,084
The chancellor doesn't appear
to be corrupt.

157
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,836
Palpatine is a politician.

158
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:02,547
I have observed
that he is very clever...

159
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:06,635
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

160
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:08,678
I think he's a good man...

161
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:10,680
I sense it too.

162
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:29,866
Stay here!

163
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:34,162
Are you all right, milady?

164
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:09,823
What the...

165
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:20,125
<i>Jedi poo doo!</i>

166
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,231
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

167
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:27,234
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is.

168
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,737
with the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

169
00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:33,657
If you spent as long practising your
sabre techniques as you do your wit...

170
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:35,534
you would rival Master Yoda
as a swordsman.

171
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,285
I thought I already did.

172
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:40,121
Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.

173
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,027
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

174
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:20,328
You know I don't like it
when you do that.

175
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:23,623
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.

176
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,543
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide!

177
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:57,824
Anakin! How many times
have I told you...

178
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:01,203
stay away from power couplings!

179
00:18:02,871 --> 00:18:04,164
That was good!

180
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:22,224
Where are you going?
He went that way.

181
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,351
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

182
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:26,478
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

183
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:30,857
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

184
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:33,693
This is a short cut... I think.

185
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:03,306
Well, you've lost him.

186
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,934
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

187
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,936
That was some short cut, Anakin.

188
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:10,438
He went completely the other way.

189
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:12,649
- Once again you've proved...
- If you'll excuse me.

190
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:17,737
I hate it when he does that.

191
00:21:46,803 --> 00:21:48,513
Anakin!

192
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,433
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

193
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,103
- Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.

194
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:57,981
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.

195
00:21:58,106 --> 00:22:00,859
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.

196
00:22:01,026 --> 00:22:04,905
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.

197
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:07,741
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

198
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:09,493
Don't say that, Master.

199
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,703
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

200
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:13,622
Then why don't you listen to me?

201
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:15,332
I am trying.

202
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:29,387
Can you see him?

203
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:31,431
I think he is a she...

204
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:34,267
and I think she is a changeling.

205
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:37,479
In that case, be extra careful.

206
00:22:39,564 --> 00:22:41,942
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

207
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:43,568
For a drink.

208
00:22:54,162 --> 00:22:55,956
Thank you.

209
00:22:56,748 --> 00:23:00,168
- You wanna buy some death sticks?
- You don't want to sell me death sticks.

210
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:02,170
I don't want to
sell you death sticks.

211
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:04,381
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

212
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:06,842
I want to go home
and rethink my life.

213
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:56,308
Easy.

214
00:23:56,474 --> 00:23:58,602
Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

215
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:07,819
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

216
00:24:08,528 --> 00:24:10,322
It was a senator from Naboo.

217
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:13,033
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.

218
00:24:14,201 --> 00:24:16,411
Who hired you? Tell us.

219
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:19,915
Tell us now!

220
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,709
It was a bounty hunter called...

221
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:32,511
<i>Wee shahnit... sleemo.</i>

222
00:24:42,103 --> 00:24:43,897
Toxic dart.

223
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:58,411
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

224
00:24:58,537 --> 00:25:01,957
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

225
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:05,919
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

226
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:09,005
Handle that your Padawan will.

227
00:25:10,757 --> 00:25:14,344
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

228
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:18,181
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

229
00:25:18,348 --> 00:25:20,308
Travel as refugees.

230
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:23,270
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

231
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:25,772
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

232
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:29,609
Until caught this killer is...

233
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:32,737
our judgement she must respect.

234
00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:35,282
Anakin, go to the senate...

235
00:25:35,448 --> 00:25:38,618
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

236
00:25:47,544 --> 00:25:49,421
I will talk with her.

237
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:52,674
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

238
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,926
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

239
00:25:55,093 --> 00:25:57,137
Thank you, Your Excellency.

240
00:25:57,262 --> 00:26:00,599
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

241
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:03,727
Your patience has paid off.

242
00:26:03,852 --> 00:26:06,104
Your guidance
more than my patience.

243
00:26:07,314 --> 00:26:09,608
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

244
00:26:10,984 --> 00:26:13,987
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

245
00:26:15,947 --> 00:26:17,991
Then you will be invincible.

246
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:23,038
I have said it many times:

247
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:25,916
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.

248
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,918
Thank you, Your Excellency.

249
00:26:28,043 --> 00:26:31,671
I see you becoming the greatest
of all the Jedi, Anakin...

250
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:34,341
even more powerful
than Master Yoda.

251
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:41,515
I am concerned for my Padawan.

252
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:44,351
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.

253
00:26:44,518 --> 00:26:47,687
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

254
00:26:47,854 --> 00:26:49,814
The boy has exceptional skills.

255
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,317
But he still has much to learn, Master.

256
00:26:52,484 --> 00:26:55,904
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

257
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:57,989
Yes.

258
00:26:58,114 --> 00:27:01,034
A flaw more and more common
among Jedi.

259
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:05,497
Too sure of themselves they are.

260
00:27:05,664 --> 00:27:09,084
Even the older,
more experienced ones.

261
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:12,712
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true...

262
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:16,466
your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance.

263
00:27:20,637 --> 00:27:23,390
I'm taking
an extended leave of absence.

264
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:26,643
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

265
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,646
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.

266
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:34,276
Mesa honoured to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

267
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:38,905
Mesa accept this
with muy, muy humility and...

268
00:27:39,072 --> 00:27:41,575
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.

269
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:43,702
I'm sure you have
a great deal to do.

270
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:45,620
Of course.

271
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:47,455
Milady.

272
00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:53,962
I do not like this idea of hiding.

273
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:56,089
Don't worry.

274
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:58,466
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

275
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,261
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

276
00:28:01,386 --> 00:28:04,222
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

277
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:06,433
to not be here
when its fate is decided.

278
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:08,602
Sometimes we must
let go of our pride...

279
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:11,229
and do what is requested of us.

280
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:13,773
Anakin, you've grown up.

281
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:18,069
Master Obi-Wan manages
not to see it.

282
00:28:24,993 --> 00:28:26,536
Don't get me wrong.

283
00:28:26,703 --> 00:28:29,539
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

284
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:32,125
As wise as Master Yoda and...

285
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:34,419
as powerful as Master Windu.

286
00:28:36,796 --> 00:28:39,174
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

287
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:44,387
In some ways...
a lot of ways...

288
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:48,433
I'm really ahead of him.

289
00:28:49,184 --> 00:28:50,977
I'm ready for the trials...

290
00:28:51,144 --> 00:28:54,481
but he feels that
I'm too unpredictable.

291
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:56,525
He won't let me move on.

292
00:28:57,442 --> 00:28:59,653
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

293
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,572
He's overly critical.
He never listens.

294
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:05,033
He doesn't understand.

295
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,244
It's not fair!

296
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:12,207
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

297
00:29:12,332 --> 00:29:14,292
It's the only way we grow.

298
00:29:16,461 --> 00:29:17,838
I know.

299
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,799
Anakin...

300
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:25,679
don't try to grow up too fast.

301
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:27,722
But I am grown up.

302
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:31,935
You said it yourself.

303
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:35,105
Please don't look at me like that.

304
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:37,607
Why not?

305
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:39,860
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

306
00:29:41,862 --> 00:29:43,822
Sorry, milady.

307
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:01,882
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

308
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:05,010
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

309
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:07,137
He'll be safe with me.

310
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:13,185
You'll be fine.

311
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,479
It's not me, milady.
I worry about you.

312
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:18,899
What if they realize
you've left the capital?

313
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:23,361
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

314
00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:25,405
Anakin...

315
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,617
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

316
00:30:28,742 --> 00:30:30,619
Yes, Master.

317
00:30:31,828 --> 00:30:34,289
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

318
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:36,333
You'll be back here in no time.

319
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,669
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Master Jedi.

320
00:30:39,836 --> 00:30:41,713
- It's time to go.
- I know.

321
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:44,299
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

322
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:46,510
May the Force be with you, Master.

323
00:30:57,979 --> 00:30:59,856
Suddenly I'm afraid.

324
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:03,568
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

325
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:08,114
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

326
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:15,997
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

327
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,210
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.

328
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,733
Someone to see ya, honey!

329
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:46,111
Jedi, by the looks of him.

330
00:31:47,195 --> 00:31:48,738
Obi-Wan!

331
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:51,116
Hello, Dex.

332
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:53,827
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.

333
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:59,207
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

334
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,047
Old buddy!

335
00:32:15,473 --> 00:32:18,393
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

336
00:32:18,518 --> 00:32:20,312
You can tell me what this is.

337
00:32:21,855 --> 00:32:25,025
Well, whattaya know!

338
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:27,527
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

339
00:32:27,694 --> 00:32:30,864
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

340
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:33,408
Can you tell me
where it came from?

341
00:32:33,575 --> 00:32:36,495
This baby belongs to them cloners.

342
00:32:36,661 --> 00:32:40,957
What you got here
is a Kamino sabredart.

343
00:32:41,082 --> 00:32:44,002
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

344
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:47,422
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

345
00:32:47,547 --> 00:32:51,426
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

346
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:53,803
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

347
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,264
for the difference
between knowledge and...

348
00:32:57,474 --> 00:32:59,100
wisdom.

349
00:32:59,226 --> 00:33:01,186
Well, if droids could think...

350
00:33:01,353 --> 00:33:03,396
there'd be none of us here,
would there?

351
00:33:04,147 --> 00:33:06,274
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

352
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:08,401
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

353
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:14,115
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

354
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:18,787
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

355
00:33:19,746 --> 00:33:24,459
These Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

356
00:33:24,584 --> 00:33:27,420
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

357
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,716
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

358
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:34,010
Depends on what, Dex?

359
00:33:34,177 --> 00:33:37,013
On how good your manners are...

360
00:33:37,138 --> 00:33:41,434
and how big your... pocketbook is.

361
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,823
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

362
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,117
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

363
00:33:57,242 --> 00:34:00,495
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

364
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,831
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

365
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:07,294
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

366
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:09,713
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

367
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,799
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

368
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:15,010
just south of the Rishi Maze.

369
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:25,312
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

370
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:27,314
doesn't exist.

371
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:30,692
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

372
00:34:30,817 --> 00:34:33,820
If an item does not appear
in our records...

373
00:34:33,987 --> 00:34:36,031
it does not exist.

374
00:34:57,844 --> 00:35:00,055
Hey, you! No droids!

375
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,349
Get outta here!

376
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:11,066
Thank you, R2.

377
00:35:11,858 --> 00:35:14,694
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi...

378
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:18,698
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

379
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:20,992
Or be with the people that I love.

380
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:23,912
Are you allowed to love?

381
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,872
I thought that was forbidden
for a Jedi.

382
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:31,711
Attachment is forbidden.

383
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:35,423
Possession is forbidden.

384
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:39,135
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

385
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:41,638
is central to a Jedi's life.

386
00:35:44,182 --> 00:35:48,478
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

387
00:35:48,645 --> 00:35:50,522
You've changed so much.

388
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:53,191
You haven't changed a bit.

389
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,194
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

390
00:36:08,874 --> 00:36:12,544
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

391
00:36:12,711 --> 00:36:15,380
Use your feelings you must.

392
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:22,804
Younglings. Younglings!

393
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:25,307
A visitor we have.

394
00:36:25,473 --> 00:36:28,310
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

395
00:36:28,476 --> 00:36:29,853
Hello.

396
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,479
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

397
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:33,940
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

398
00:36:35,442 --> 00:36:38,278
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

399
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:41,531
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

400
00:36:43,158 --> 00:36:45,994
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

401
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,079
How embarrassing!

402
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,502
Liam, the shades.

403
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,297
Gather round the map reader.

404
00:36:57,464 --> 00:36:59,591
Clear your minds...

405
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:03,178
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

406
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:07,516
It ought to be here...

407
00:37:07,682 --> 00:37:09,559
but it isn't.

408
00:37:09,684 --> 00:37:13,104
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

409
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:16,775
Gravity's silhouette remains...

410
00:37:16,942 --> 00:37:19,861
but the star and all the planets...

411
00:37:19,986 --> 00:37:21,947
disappeared they have.

412
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:24,241
How can this be?

413
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,077
A thought?

414
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:29,871
Anyone.

415
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,706
Master?

416
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:34,709
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

417
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:41,925
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

418
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:47,097
The Padawan is right.

419
00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:50,225
Go to the centre of gravity's pull...

420
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:53,812
and find your planet you will.

421
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:02,279
The data must have been erased.

422
00:38:02,696 --> 00:38:07,409
But who could empty information from
the archives? Isn't that impossible?

423
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,912
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

424
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:15,375
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

425
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:18,962
But who and why, harder to answer.

426
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:22,883
Meditate on this I will.

427
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:49,993
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

428
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,747
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

429
00:38:53,872 --> 00:38:55,749
I'm not sure I was ready.

430
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,418
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

431
00:38:58,877 --> 00:39:00,921
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...

432
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:03,089
so you could stay in office.

433
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,634
I was relieved
when my two terms were up.

434
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,429
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

435
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:11,556
I couldn't refuse her.

436
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,227
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

437
00:39:17,354 --> 00:39:19,481
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

438
00:39:26,488 --> 00:39:29,991
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.

439
00:39:30,158 --> 00:39:31,952
It's unthinkable!

440
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:35,455
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

441
00:39:35,622 --> 00:39:38,041
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

442
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,252
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

443
00:39:40,418 --> 00:39:42,546
Not if they feel threatened.

444
00:39:42,712 --> 00:39:46,049
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

445
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:48,134
It's outrageous...

446
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,470
but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

447
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:54,391
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

448
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,520
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

449
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,816
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

450
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:13,785
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

451
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,580
Let's pray that day never comes.

452
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,374
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

453
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,419
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

454
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,922
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.

455
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:27,841
- But I was thinking...
- Hold on a minute.

456
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,217
Excuse me.

457
00:40:29,384 --> 00:40:31,761
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

458
00:40:31,928 --> 00:40:34,139
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

459
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:37,267
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

460
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,021
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.

461
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,148
I think it would be wise...

462
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:45,609
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

463
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,904
Sorry, milady.

464
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:54,284
Perfect. It's settled, then.

465
00:41:08,256 --> 00:41:10,926
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

466
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:12,886
Our missing planet Kamino.

467
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,968
Master Jedi.

468
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,388
The prime minister is expecting you.

469
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,016
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

470
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,186
He is anxious to meet you.

471
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:05,480
After all these years...

472
00:42:05,647 --> 00:42:09,234
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

473
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,570
Now, please, this way.

474
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:26,793
May I present Lama Su...

475
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,004
prime minister of Kamino.

476
00:42:30,755 --> 00:42:32,799
And this is Master Jedi...

477
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:34,926
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

478
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:38,305
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

479
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:41,766
Please.

480
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,562
And now to business.

481
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,608
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

482
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:52,652
200,000 units are ready...

483
00:42:52,777 --> 00:42:55,071
with a million more
well on the way.

484
00:42:56,281 --> 00:42:58,158
That's good news.

485
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,411
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

486
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:04,915
that his order will be met on time.

487
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm sorry. Master...

488
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,670
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

489
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:13,924
a leading member of the Jedi Council,
is he not?

490
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,844
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

491
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,806
I'm so sorry to hear that.

492
00:43:21,973 --> 00:43:26,186
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

493
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,647
The army?

494
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:32,400
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

495
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:34,778
one of the finest we've ever created.

496
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,863
Tell me, Prime Minister...

497
00:43:36,988 --> 00:43:39,407
when my master first contacted you
about the army...

498
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:41,701
did he say who it was for?

499
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,787
Of course he did.

500
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,623
This army is for the Republic.

501
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:51,086
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

502
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,714
That's why I'm here.

503
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,696
We used to come here
for school retreat.

504
00:44:19,447 --> 00:44:21,491
We would swim
to that island every day.

505
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,828
I love the water.

506
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:33,170
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

507
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,631
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

508
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,511
I don't like sand.

509
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:45,974
It's coarse and rough and irritating...

510
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,393
and it gets everywhere.

511
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,647
Not like here.

512
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,233
Here, everything is soft...

513
00:44:57,402 --> 00:44:59,529
and smooth.

514
00:45:36,149 --> 00:45:37,776
No.

515
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,529
I shouldn't have done that.

516
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,241
I'm sorry.

517
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,464
Very impressive.

518
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:01,716
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

519
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,305
Clones can think creatively.

520
00:46:07,472 --> 00:46:11,309
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

521
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:20,485
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programmes.

522
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,989
This group was created
about five years ago.

523
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,158
You mentioned growth acceleration.

524
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,160
Oh, yes, it's essential.

525
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:31,329
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

526
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:33,999
Now we can do it in half the time.

527
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,751
I see.

528
00:46:36,918 --> 00:46:38,795
They are totally obedient...

529
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,590
taking any order without question.

530
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,758
We modified their genetic structure...

531
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,053
to make them less independent
than the original host.

532
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,723
And who was the original host?

533
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,933
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

534
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,604
And where is this bounty hunter now?

535
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,898
Oh, we keep him here.

536
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,403
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...

537
00:47:03,528 --> 00:47:05,947
Fett demanded only one thing:

538
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,658
an unaltered clone for himself.

539
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:11,203
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

540
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:13,830
Pure genetic replication.

541
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,083
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

542
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,753
and no growth acceleration.

543
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,173
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

544
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:26,551
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

545
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,905
Magnificent, aren't they?

546
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,871
I don't know.

547
00:47:56,122 --> 00:47:58,250
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

548
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:00,710
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

549
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,921
They only work on the weak-minded.

550
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,007
All right.

551
00:48:06,132 --> 00:48:08,260
I was 12.
His name was Palo.

552
00:48:08,426 --> 00:48:10,846
We were both
in the Legislative Youth Programme.

553
00:48:11,012 --> 00:48:14,015
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

554
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,476
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

555
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,603
All right, I get the picture.

556
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,897
Whatever happened to him?

557
00:48:21,022 --> 00:48:23,692
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.

558
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,902
Maybe he was the smart one.

559
00:48:26,027 --> 00:48:28,238
You really don't like
politicians, do you?

560
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,532
I like two or three...

561
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,701
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

562
00:48:36,746 --> 00:48:38,790
I don't think the system works.

563
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,585
How would you have it work?

564
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,922
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

565
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,884
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...

566
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:50,844
and then do it.

567
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,721
That's exactly what we do.

568
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,848
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

569
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,892
Well, then they should be made to.

570
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,020
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.

571
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,230
- You?
- Of course not me.

572
00:49:02,355 --> 00:49:05,275
- But someone.
- Someone wise.

573
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:09,196
Sounds an awful lot
like a dictatorship to me.

574
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,949
Well, if it works.

575
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:21,875
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

576
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,503
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

577
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:06,086
Ani, are you all right?

578
00:50:42,455 --> 00:50:45,458
Boba, is your father here?

579
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,502
Yep.

580
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,713
May we see him?

581
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,591
Sure.

582
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,386
Dad, Taun We's here.

583
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,985
Jango, welcome back.

584
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,237
Was your trip productive?

585
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,281
Fairly.

586
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:20,202
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

587
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:23,121
He's come to check on our progress.

588
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,333
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

589
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,503
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.

590
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:33,256
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?

591
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,301
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

592
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,096
Possibly.

593
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,307
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.

594
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,939
Boba, <i>rood eht so-heeck.</i>

595
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,566
Master who?

596
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,612
Sifo-Dyas.

597
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,365
Is he not the Jedi
who hired you for this job?

598
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,245
Never heard of him.

599
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:07,958
Really?

600
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:12,504
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

601
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,047
Curious.

602
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:20,345
Do you like your army?

603
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,139
I look forward
to seeing them in action.

604
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,727
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

605
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,021
Thank you for your time, Jango.

606
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,859
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

607
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,505
What is it, Dad?

608
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,884
Pack your things.
We're leaving.

609
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:08,143
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.

610
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,312
"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

611
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,899
Well, negotiations with a lightsabre.

612
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,998
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

613
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,613
From the moment I met you...

614
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,866
all those years ago...

615
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,328
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

616
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,416
And now that I'm with you again...

617
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,169
I'm in agony.

618
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:23,426
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

619
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,971
The thought of not being with you...

620
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,765
I can't breathe.

621
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,563
I'm haunted by the kiss...

622
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,649
that you should never have given me.

623
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,402
My heart is beating...

624
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:43,488
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

625
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,535
You are in my very soul...

626
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,745
tormenting me.

627
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:56,710
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

628
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,266
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

629
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,020
I can't.

630
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,149
We can't.
It's... just not possible.

631
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,235
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

632
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,446
No, you listen.

633
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:28,658
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

634
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:32,412
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

635
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,791
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...

636
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,377
it'll take us to a place
we cannot go...

637
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,923
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

638
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,008
Then you do feel something.

639
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:48,178
I will not let you give up
your future for me.

640
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,430
You are asking me to be rational.

641
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,809
That is something
I know I cannot do.

642
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:58,605
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings...

643
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,690
but I can't.

644
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,361
I will not give in to this.

645
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,745
Well, you know...

646
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,623
it wouldn't have to be that way.

647
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,626
We could keep it a secret.

648
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,046
We'd be living a lie...

649
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,423
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

650
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,802
I couldn't do that.

651
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:31,805
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

652
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,810
No. You're right.

653
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,272
It would destroy us.

654
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,616
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

655
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,162
And remind them,
if they need more troops...

656
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:58,373
it will take more time to grow them.

657
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,250
I won't forget, and thank you.

658
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,210
Thank you.

659
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,604
R4!

660
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,024
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

661
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:33,909
<i>I have successfully made contact</i>
<i>with the prime minister of Kamino.</i>

662
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:37,913
<i>They are using a bounty hunter named</i>
<i>Jango Fett to create a clone army.</i>

663
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,499
<i>I have a strong feeling</i>
<i>that this bounty hunter...</i>

664
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,709
<i>is the assassin we are looking for.</i>

665
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,836
Do you think these cloners
are involved...

666
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,005
in the plot to assassinate
Senator Amidala?

667
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,966
<i>No, Master.</i>
<i>There appears to be no motive.</i>

668
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,969
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

669
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,056
Clear your mind must be...

670
00:57:56,223 --> 00:58:00,352
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

671
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,312
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

672
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,482
<i>They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed</i>
<i>an order for a clone army...</i>

673
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:09,236
<i>at the request of the senate</i>
<i>almost ten years ago.</i>

674
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:14,950
<i>I was under the impression</i>
<i>he was killed before that.</i>

675
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:18,578
<i>Did the council ever authorize</i>
<i>the creation of a clone army?</i>

676
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,580
No. Whoever placed that order...

677
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,916
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

678
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,670
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

679
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,882
<i>Yes, Master.</i>
<i>I will report back when I have him.</i>

680
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,137
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

681
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,431
we could not see.

682
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,937
I think it is time
we informed the senate...

683
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,148
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

684
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:51,319
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

685
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,697
If informed the senate is...

686
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,283
multiply our adversaries will.

687
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,578
No.

688
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,000
Mom, no.

689
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,822
Don't go.

690
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,826
I don't want to disturb you.

691
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,121
Your presence is soothing.

692
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,084
You had another nightmare last night.

693
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,671
Jedi don't have nightmares.

694
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,216
I heard you.

695
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,139
I saw my mother.

696
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,228
She is suffering, Padmé.

697
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,900
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

698
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:25,747
She is in pain.

699
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:30,210
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

700
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:32,337
but I have to go.

701
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,300
I have to help her.

702
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,929
I'll go with you.

703
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:43,306
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

704
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,319
Dad, look!

705
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:59,322
Boba, get on board!

706
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,359
Oh, not good.

707
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,323
Wait right there.

708
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,450
Okey-okey.

709
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,496
<i>Chut-chut,</i> Watto.

710
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,750
Let me help you with that.

711
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,213
What? What do you want?

712
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,799
Wait! You're a Jedi!

713
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:49,135
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

714
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,977
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

715
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,439
Ani?

716
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:05,068
Little Ani?

717
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,031
Nahhh.

718
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,494
You are Ani! It is you!

719
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:19,207
You sure sprouted, huh?

720
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,544
AJedi! Whattaya know!

721
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,676
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

722
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:31,303
My mother.

723
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,889
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

724
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:38,560
She's not mine-a no more-a.
I sold her.

725
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:40,979
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

726
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:44,232
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

727
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:49,070
I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

728
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:51,198
At least I think it was Lars.

729
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,868
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

730
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,245
Can ya beat that, eh?

731
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,833
Do you know where they are now?

732
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:04,794
Long way from here.

733
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:09,424
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

734
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,510
I'd like to know.

735
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,972
Sure. Absolutely!

736
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:19,100
Let's go look at my records, huh?

737
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:50,590
Dad!
I think we're being tracked!

738
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:54,177
He must have put
a homing device on our hull.

739
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,513
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

740
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,516
and we'll have
a couple of surprises for him.

741
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,487
Seismic charges!

742
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:13,905
Stand by.

743
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,933
He doesn't seem
to take a hint, this guy.

744
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,786
Watch out!

745
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:24,226
Get him, Dad! Fire!

746
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:28,688
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

747
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,252
We got him!

748
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:52,379
We'll just have to finish him.

749
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:21,867
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

750
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:28,665
Fire them now!

751
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,263
We won't be seeing him again.

752
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:19,841
Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

753
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:44,324
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

754
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,404
Stay with the ship, R2.

755
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:40,922
Hello. How might I be
of service? I am C...

756
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:42,966
3PO?

757
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:46,636
The maker!

758
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,430
Master Ani!

759
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:51,308
I knew you would return.
I knew it!

760
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:53,185
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

761
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,853
Hello, 3PO.

762
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:58,857
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

763
01:11:59,024 --> 01:12:00,984
I've come to see my mother.

764
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,863
I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.

765
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:12,287
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

766
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:14,706
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

767
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:17,626
Owen Lars.

768
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:19,878
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.

769
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:22,005
I'm Padmé.

770
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:24,758
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

771
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:27,761
I had a feeling
you might show up someday.

772
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:30,305
Is my mother here?

773
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:32,140
No, she's not.

774
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,060
Cliegg Lars.

775
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:37,145
Shmi is my wife.

776
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:41,316
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

777
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:52,035
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

778
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,996
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

779
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:58,875
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

780
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:02,379
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

781
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:06,633
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...

782
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,677
when they took her.

783
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,347
Those Tuskens walk like men...

784
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:17,018
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

785
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,898
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

786
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:27,028
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...

787
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:32,742
I just couldn't ride any more
until I heal.

788
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,620
I don't want to give up on her...

789
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:38,582
but she's been gone a month.

790
01:13:38,707 --> 01:13:41,710
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

791
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:48,467
Where are you going?

792
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,011
To find my mother.

793
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:55,056
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.

794
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:20,165
You're gonna have to stay here.

795
01:14:20,332 --> 01:14:23,001
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

796
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:37,599
I won't be long.

797
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,543
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...

798
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:31,046
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

799
01:16:31,213 --> 01:16:33,965
What about the senator
from Naboo?

800
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:36,676
Is she dead yet?

801
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:41,264
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

802
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:43,683
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

803
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:46,853
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

804
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:50,190
you'll have the finest army
in the galaxy.

805
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:02,994
As I explained to you earlier...

806
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:06,289
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...

807
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:09,209
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

808
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:13,129
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

809
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:15,799
The Techno Union army...

810
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:21,805
is at your disposal, Count.

811
01:17:22,681 --> 01:17:26,184
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

812
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,186
Good. Very good.

813
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:32,732
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

814
01:17:33,108 --> 01:17:35,527
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

815
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:38,822
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

816
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:42,367
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

817
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:47,247
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

818
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:50,101
Mom?

819
01:18:52,562 --> 01:18:54,523
Ani?

820
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:57,567
Ani?

821
01:18:58,819 --> 01:19:00,445
Is it you?

822
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:04,157
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

823
01:19:10,539 --> 01:19:13,458
You look so handsome.

824
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,964
My son.

825
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:21,883
My grown-up son.

826
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:25,637
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

827
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:27,681
I missed you.

828
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:32,519
Now I am complete.

829
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:41,611
I love y...

830
01:19:42,821 --> 01:19:45,907
Stay with me, Mom. Everything...

831
01:19:46,074 --> 01:19:48,118
I love...

832
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:52,080
I love...

833
01:20:49,221 --> 01:20:51,264
<i>Anakin!</i>

834
01:20:51,807 --> 01:20:53,266
<i>No!</i>

835
01:21:13,662 --> 01:21:15,288
What is it?

836
01:21:16,373 --> 01:21:19,793
Pain, suffering...

837
01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:22,379
death I feel.

838
01:21:26,967 --> 01:21:30,053
Something terrible has happened.

839
01:21:32,764 --> 01:21:35,767
Young Skywalker is in pain...

840
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:37,769
terrible pain.

841
01:21:42,566 --> 01:21:46,153
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

842
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:48,989
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

843
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:52,576
We'll have to try something else.

844
01:21:55,537 --> 01:21:58,290
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo.

845
01:21:58,665 --> 01:22:00,292
It's much closer.

846
01:22:02,127 --> 01:22:04,421
Anakin, do you copy?

847
01:22:04,588 --> 01:22:07,507
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

848
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:09,968
He's not on Naboo, R4.

849
01:22:11,553 --> 01:22:13,680
I'm going to try and widen the range.

850
01:22:17,142 --> 01:22:19,102
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

851
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:28,487
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right...

852
01:22:28,612 --> 01:22:31,031
but it's coming from Tatooine.

853
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:35,202
What in the blazes is he doing there?

854
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:37,329
I told him to stay on Naboo.

855
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:42,459
We haven't got much time.

856
01:22:42,626 --> 01:22:44,669
Anakin, do you copy?

857
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:46,838
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

858
01:22:54,763 --> 01:22:56,640
<i>Retransmit this message...</i>

859
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:01,353
<i>Anakin, do you copy?</i>

860
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,814
<i>My long-range transmitter</i>
<i>has been knocked out.</i>

861
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,274
<i>Retransmit this message to Coruscant.</i>

862
01:23:50,861 --> 01:23:52,821
I brought you something.

863
01:23:52,988 --> 01:23:55,115
Are you hungry?

864
01:23:56,867 --> 01:23:58,827
The shifter broke.

865
01:24:00,704 --> 01:24:03,456
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

866
01:24:05,959 --> 01:24:09,463
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.

867
01:24:11,798 --> 01:24:13,758
But I couldn't...

868
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:19,639
Why'd she have to die?

869
01:24:23,185 --> 01:24:25,228
Why couldn't I save her?

870
01:24:25,395 --> 01:24:27,439
I know I could have!

871
01:24:30,275 --> 01:24:32,777
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

872
01:24:34,488 --> 01:24:37,157
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

873
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,870
Someday I will be.

874
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:44,831
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

875
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:48,627
I promise you.

876
01:24:49,377 --> 01:24:51,671
I will even learn
to stop people from dying.

877
01:24:55,509 --> 01:24:59,429
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!

878
01:24:59,596 --> 01:25:01,640
He's holding me back!

879
01:25:06,019 --> 01:25:08,063
What's wrong, Ani?

880
01:25:18,824 --> 01:25:20,784
I killed them.

881
01:25:22,536 --> 01:25:24,496
I killed them all.

882
01:25:26,331 --> 01:25:28,208
They're dead.

883
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:30,377
Every single one of them.

884
01:25:32,587 --> 01:25:34,548
And not just the men...

885
01:25:36,591 --> 01:25:38,468
but the women...

886
01:25:38,635 --> 01:25:40,512
and the children too.

887
01:25:41,513 --> 01:25:43,557
They're like animals...

888
01:25:43,682 --> 01:25:45,976
and I slaughtered them like animals!

889
01:25:47,644 --> 01:25:49,604
I hate them!

890
01:26:07,497 --> 01:26:09,457
To be angry is to be human.

891
01:26:09,583 --> 01:26:11,459
I'm a Jedi.

892
01:26:12,586 --> 01:26:14,463
I know I'm better than this.

893
01:26:28,477 --> 01:26:32,939
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

894
01:26:33,398 --> 01:26:38,195
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

895
01:26:41,198 --> 01:26:43,241
Goodbye, my darling wife.

896
01:26:47,245 --> 01:26:49,122
And thank you.

897
01:27:16,483 --> 01:27:18,693
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

898
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:23,114
I wasn't strong enough.

899
01:27:27,702 --> 01:27:31,039
But I promise I won't fail again.

900
01:27:42,008 --> 01:27:44,052
I miss you...

901
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:47,305
so much.

902
01:27:54,312 --> 01:27:56,982
R2? What are you doing here?

903
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:04,114
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

904
01:28:05,115 --> 01:28:08,201
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

905
01:28:10,412 --> 01:28:12,789
<i>Anakin, my long-range transmitter</i>
<i>has been knocked out.</i>

906
01:28:12,956 --> 01:28:15,167
<i>Retransmit this message</i>
<i>to Coruscant.</i>

907
01:28:19,713 --> 01:28:21,923
<i>I have tracked the bounty hunter,</i>
<i>Jango Fett...</i>

908
01:28:22,048 --> 01:28:24,176
<i>to the droid foundries on Geonosis.</i>

909
01:28:24,301 --> 01:28:27,888
<i>The Trade Federation is</i>
<i>to take delivery of a droid army here...</i>

910
01:28:28,054 --> 01:28:30,015
<i>and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...</i>

911
01:28:30,182 --> 01:28:33,602
<i>is behind the assassination attempts</i>
<i>on Senator Amidala.</i>

912
01:28:33,768 --> 01:28:35,896
<i>The Commerce Guilds</i>
<i>and the Corporate Alliance...</i>

913
01:28:36,021 --> 01:28:39,649
<i>have both pledged their armies</i>
<i>to Count Dooku and are forming...</i>

914
01:28:39,816 --> 01:28:41,860
<i>Wait.</i>

915
01:28:52,704 --> 01:28:57,334
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

916
01:28:57,459 --> 01:28:59,169
I agree.

917
01:29:00,629 --> 01:29:02,839
<i>We will deal with Count Dooku.</i>

918
01:29:03,006 --> 01:29:06,510
<i>The most important thing for you</i>
<i>is to stay where you are.</i>

919
01:29:06,676 --> 01:29:09,346
<i>Protect the senator at all costs.</i>

920
01:29:09,513 --> 01:29:12,015
<i>That is your first priority.</i>

921
01:29:13,558 --> 01:29:15,519
Understood, Master.

922
01:29:15,644 --> 01:29:17,604
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

923
01:29:17,771 --> 01:29:20,774
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

924
01:29:23,026 --> 01:29:25,070
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

925
01:29:25,237 --> 01:29:27,197
If he's still alive.

926
01:29:29,115 --> 01:29:31,701
Are you just gonna sit here
and let him die?

927
01:29:31,868 --> 01:29:34,329
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!

928
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:39,209
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

929
01:29:39,376 --> 01:29:42,546
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...

930
01:29:42,712 --> 01:29:44,923
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

931
01:29:46,299 --> 01:29:49,803
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

932
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:57,060
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

933
01:30:07,362 --> 01:30:10,282
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.

934
01:30:10,407 --> 01:30:12,367
Count Dooku must have made
a treaty with them.

935
01:30:12,492 --> 01:30:15,829
The debate is over.

936
01:30:15,996 --> 01:30:18,915
Now we need that clone army.

937
01:30:19,082 --> 01:30:22,002
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.

938
01:30:22,127 --> 01:30:24,504
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

939
01:30:24,671 --> 01:30:26,381
before the separatists attack.

940
01:30:26,548 --> 01:30:28,425
This is a crisis.

941
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:31,636
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency poWers.

942
01:30:31,761 --> 01:30:34,848
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

943
01:30:35,182 --> 01:30:37,309
But what senator would have
the courage...

944
01:30:37,476 --> 01:30:39,978
to propose such a radical amendment?

945
01:30:40,145 --> 01:30:44,191
If only Senator Amidala were here.

946
01:31:05,629 --> 01:31:07,422
Traitor.

947
01:31:07,964 --> 01:31:11,134
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

948
01:31:11,259 --> 01:31:13,303
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

949
01:31:13,428 --> 01:31:15,972
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.

950
01:31:16,139 --> 01:31:18,683
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

951
01:31:18,850 --> 01:31:22,270
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

952
01:31:22,395 --> 01:31:25,982
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

953
01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:29,903
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

954
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:32,447
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

955
01:31:32,614 --> 01:31:35,450
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

956
01:31:35,617 --> 01:31:37,494
Do you know him?

957
01:31:37,619 --> 01:31:40,121
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

958
01:31:40,288 --> 01:31:42,165
The Geonosians don't trust them.

959
01:31:42,332 --> 01:31:45,168
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

960
01:31:46,336 --> 01:31:50,465
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

961
01:31:51,174 --> 01:31:53,593
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.

962
01:31:58,515 --> 01:32:00,559
I wish he were still alive.

963
01:32:02,018 --> 01:32:04,688
I could use his help right now.

964
01:32:05,856 --> 01:32:08,066
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

965
01:32:09,943 --> 01:32:12,696
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

966
01:32:12,863 --> 01:32:15,365
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...

967
01:32:15,532 --> 01:32:17,576
just as you were once his.

968
01:32:18,535 --> 01:32:20,745
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

969
01:32:20,871 --> 01:32:23,874
but he wouldn't have gone along with
it if he had learned the truth as I have.

970
01:32:23,999 --> 01:32:26,751
- The truth?
- The truth.

971
01:32:33,175 --> 01:32:36,428
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

972
01:32:36,595 --> 01:32:38,638
of the dark lord of the Sith?

973
01:32:38,763 --> 01:32:41,600
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

974
01:32:41,725 --> 01:32:45,937
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

975
01:32:47,105 --> 01:32:49,608
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

976
01:32:49,774 --> 01:32:54,321
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

977
01:32:55,489 --> 01:32:57,032
I don't believe you.

978
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:59,493
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

979
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:02,829
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious...

980
01:33:03,747 --> 01:33:07,542
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

981
01:33:07,709 --> 01:33:10,796
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

982
01:33:12,839 --> 01:33:14,883
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

983
01:33:16,092 --> 01:33:20,013
and together we will destroy the Sith!

984
01:33:21,807 --> 01:33:24,059
I will never join you, Dooku.

985
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:36,530
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

986
01:33:44,371 --> 01:33:47,207
It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact...

987
01:33:47,374 --> 01:33:49,960
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

988
01:33:50,127 --> 01:33:54,422
Senators, "dellow felagates":

989
01:33:54,548 --> 01:33:58,510
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...

990
01:33:58,677 --> 01:34:02,305
mesa propose that the senate...

991
01:34:02,472 --> 01:34:06,059
give immediately emergency powers...

992
01:34:06,226 --> 01:34:08,812
to the supreme chancellor.

993
01:34:12,941 --> 01:34:15,068
Palpatine! Palpatine!

994
01:34:18,155 --> 01:34:21,408
Order! We shall have order!

995
01:34:23,118 --> 01:34:26,371
It is with great reluctance...

996
01:34:26,538 --> 01:34:28,582
that I have agreed to this calling.

997
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,920
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.

998
01:34:34,838 --> 01:34:36,965
The power you give me...

999
01:34:37,132 --> 01:34:41,595
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

1000
01:34:46,141 --> 01:34:50,937
And as my first act
with this new authority...

1001
01:34:51,062 --> 01:34:55,442
I will create
a grand army of the Republic...

1002
01:34:55,567 --> 01:34:59,279
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

1003
01:35:00,697 --> 01:35:02,574
It is done, then.

1004
01:35:07,871 --> 01:35:11,500
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1005
01:35:11,666 --> 01:35:15,504
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

1006
01:35:16,588 --> 01:35:20,258
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1007
01:35:40,946 --> 01:35:42,989
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?

1008
01:35:43,114 --> 01:35:45,158
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1009
01:35:46,034 --> 01:35:47,994
That'll do.

1010
01:35:57,462 --> 01:36:00,382
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

1011
01:36:00,507 --> 01:36:02,551
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

1012
01:36:02,717 --> 01:36:04,594
As a member of the senate...

1013
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:07,556
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1014
01:36:07,931 --> 01:36:09,891
Don't worry.

1015
01:36:10,142 --> 01:36:12,394
I've given up
trying to argue with you.

1016
01:36:17,190 --> 01:36:20,360
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

1017
01:36:20,527 --> 01:36:22,404
they would have asked for it.

1018
01:36:22,529 --> 01:36:25,615
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behaviour.

1019
01:36:51,558 --> 01:36:54,728
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

1020
01:36:56,813 --> 01:36:59,357
I am programmed
to understand humans!

1021
01:37:02,986 --> 01:37:04,863
"What does that mean?"

1022
01:37:04,988 --> 01:37:07,657
That means I am in charge here!

1023
01:37:07,824 --> 01:37:09,451
Where are you going now?

1024
01:37:09,576 --> 01:37:13,079
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

1025
01:37:13,455 --> 01:37:15,081
Idiot!

1026
01:37:17,334 --> 01:37:19,044
Please wait.

1027
01:37:19,878 --> 01:37:21,755
Do you know where you're going?

1028
01:37:34,434 --> 01:37:36,061
Wait.

1029
01:38:51,845 --> 01:38:53,555
Oh, my goodness!

1030
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:55,223
Shut me down!

1031
01:38:56,349 --> 01:38:58,310
Machines making machines.

1032
01:38:58,435 --> 01:38:59,895
How perverse!

1033
01:39:00,854 --> 01:39:02,230
Calm down, R2!

1034
01:39:02,397 --> 01:39:04,816
I almost fell.

1035
01:39:04,983 --> 01:39:06,943
You'll get your chance...

1036
01:39:08,945 --> 01:39:10,739
I'm scrap.

1037
01:39:11,865 --> 01:39:14,201
It's a nightmare!

1038
01:39:16,036 --> 01:39:17,996
I want to go home!

1039
01:39:19,539 --> 01:39:21,416
What did I do to deserve this?

1040
01:40:01,373 --> 01:40:03,583
I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

1041
01:40:03,708 --> 01:40:06,044
He's always getting himself
into trouble.

1042
01:40:07,462 --> 01:40:09,005
Oh, no!

1043
01:40:18,473 --> 01:40:20,100
Uh-oh.

1044
01:40:23,728 --> 01:40:25,689
I'm so confused.

1045
01:42:21,596 --> 01:42:23,390
Not again!

1046
01:42:23,765 --> 01:42:25,725
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1047
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:36,236
Don't move, Jedi!

1048
01:42:36,403 --> 01:42:37,863
Take him away.

1049
01:42:56,923 --> 01:42:58,717
Don't be afraid.

1050
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:02,471
I'm not afraid to die.

1051
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:11,480
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1052
01:43:12,772 --> 01:43:15,275
What are you talking about?

1053
01:43:16,818 --> 01:43:18,862
I love you.

1054
01:43:22,657 --> 01:43:24,618
You love me?

1055
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:32,334
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love...

1056
01:43:34,085 --> 01:43:37,088
that we would be forced
to live a lie...

1057
01:43:37,964 --> 01:43:40,967
and that it would destroy our lives.

1058
01:43:41,885 --> 01:43:44,095
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1059
01:43:49,267 --> 01:43:51,061
I truly...

1060
01:43:52,103 --> 01:43:54,481
deeply love you...

1061
01:43:55,732 --> 01:43:58,276
and before we die,
I want you to know.

1062
01:44:55,459 --> 01:44:58,044
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1063
01:44:58,211 --> 01:45:01,214
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1064
01:45:03,633 --> 01:45:05,510
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.

1065
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:08,013
Good job.

1066
01:45:20,358 --> 01:45:23,361
Settle down. Settle down.

1067
01:45:27,407 --> 01:45:31,077
Let the executions begin.

1068
01:46:03,902 --> 01:46:06,822
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1069
01:46:32,389 --> 01:46:34,850
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1070
01:46:35,016 --> 01:46:37,144
She seems to be on top of things.

1071
01:47:40,123 --> 01:47:41,833
She can't do that!

1072
01:47:41,958 --> 01:47:43,835
Shoot her... or something!

1073
01:49:02,706 --> 01:49:04,082
Jump!

1074
01:49:28,231 --> 01:49:31,735
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

1075
01:49:31,902 --> 01:49:33,528
Jango! Finish her off!

1076
01:49:33,653 --> 01:49:36,823
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

1077
01:50:07,729 --> 01:50:09,189
Master Windu.

1078
01:50:09,314 --> 01:50:11,566
How pleasant of you to join us.

1079
01:50:11,733 --> 01:50:13,693
This party's over.

1080
01:50:27,332 --> 01:50:29,543
Brave...

1081
01:50:29,709 --> 01:50:32,003
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1082
01:50:32,170 --> 01:50:33,964
You're impossibly outnumbered.

1083
01:50:34,131 --> 01:50:36,424
I don't think so.

1084
01:50:36,591 --> 01:50:37,968
We'll see.

1085
01:51:16,756 --> 01:51:19,301
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1086
01:51:59,090 --> 01:52:01,510
What's all this noise?
A battle!

1087
01:52:01,676 --> 01:52:03,804
There's been some terrible mistake!

1088
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:06,640
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1089
01:53:34,227 --> 01:53:36,021
Die, Jedi dogs!

1090
01:53:36,188 --> 01:53:37,898
Oh! What did I say?

1091
01:53:47,032 --> 01:53:50,285
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1092
01:53:55,999 --> 01:53:58,919
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.

1093
01:54:13,391 --> 01:54:16,895
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1094
01:54:22,025 --> 01:54:23,985
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

1095
01:54:42,170 --> 01:54:44,381
R2, what are you doing here?

1096
01:54:47,634 --> 01:54:48,927
What are you doing?

1097
01:54:49,094 --> 01:54:51,680
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.

1098
01:54:51,847 --> 01:54:53,557
My neck!

1099
01:54:55,892 --> 01:54:58,895
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!

1100
01:55:03,942 --> 01:55:05,986
I'm quite beside myself.

1101
01:55:14,703 --> 01:55:17,873
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1102
01:55:19,374 --> 01:55:21,835
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1103
01:55:44,649 --> 01:55:46,276
Master Windu...

1104
01:55:46,401 --> 01:55:48,612
you have fought gallantly...

1105
01:55:49,779 --> 01:55:53,825
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.

1106
01:55:55,786 --> 01:55:57,037
Now...

1107
01:55:58,079 --> 01:56:00,415
it is finished.

1108
01:56:00,582 --> 01:56:02,375
Surrender...

1109
01:56:02,667 --> 01:56:05,337
and your lives will be spared.

1110
01:56:06,254 --> 01:56:09,341
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1111
01:56:09,466 --> 01:56:10,467
Then...

1112
01:56:11,968 --> 01:56:14,012
I'm sorry, old friend.

1113
01:56:24,731 --> 01:56:26,107
Look!

1114
01:56:38,161 --> 01:56:42,082
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.

1115
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:41,683
I've had the most peculiar dream!

1116
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:54,279
If Dooku escapes...

1117
01:57:54,404 --> 01:57:58,074
rally more systems
to his cause he will.

1118
01:58:02,662 --> 01:58:04,456
Hold on!

1119
01:58:09,044 --> 01:58:11,004
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1120
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:19,554
Good call, my young Padawan.

1121
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:36,112
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

1122
01:58:36,279 --> 01:58:38,323
That doesn't seem possible.

1123
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:41,118
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1124
01:58:41,451 --> 01:58:44,621
We must send
all available droids into battle.

1125
01:58:44,788 --> 01:58:46,665
There are too many.

1126
01:58:47,666 --> 01:58:50,418
Our communications have been jammed.

1127
01:58:58,635 --> 01:59:01,555
Pilot, land in that assembly area!

1128
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:02,931
Yes, sir.

1129
01:59:11,064 --> 01:59:12,274
Sir...

1130
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:15,026
I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1131
01:59:16,069 --> 01:59:19,322
To the forward command centre
take me.

1132
01:59:42,679 --> 01:59:45,432
Attack those Federation starships,
quickly!

1133
01:59:56,401 --> 02:00:00,155
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1134
02:00:00,322 --> 02:00:02,115
Very good.

1135
02:00:02,824 --> 02:00:04,451
Very good.

1136
02:00:32,646 --> 02:00:34,689
This is not looking good at all!

1137
02:00:36,024 --> 02:00:39,277
We must get the starships
back into space.

1138
02:00:42,322 --> 02:00:46,201
We have to order a retreat.

1139
02:00:46,368 --> 02:00:48,662
My master will never allow
the Republic...

1140
02:00:48,829 --> 02:00:51,081
to get away with this treachery.

1141
02:00:51,289 --> 02:00:54,459
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

1142
02:00:54,626 --> 02:00:58,672
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1143
02:01:01,091 --> 02:01:06,346
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

1144
02:01:09,641 --> 02:01:12,018
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1145
02:01:13,019 --> 02:01:15,689
They will be much safer there
with my master.

1146
02:02:10,285 --> 02:02:14,998
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1147
02:02:15,165 --> 02:02:16,958
Yes, sir.

1148
02:02:17,125 --> 02:02:20,545
Move all quadrants to sector 515.

1149
02:03:00,710 --> 02:03:02,170
Look over there!

1150
02:03:05,674 --> 02:03:08,009
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1151
02:03:08,176 --> 02:03:10,053
We're out of rockets, sir.

1152
02:03:10,178 --> 02:03:13,014
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1153
02:03:13,348 --> 02:03:17,144
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1154
02:03:40,667 --> 02:03:43,211
Put the ship down!

1155
02:03:43,378 --> 02:03:45,255
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

1156
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:47,090
Follow that speeder!

1157
02:03:53,221 --> 02:03:55,515
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1158
02:03:55,682 --> 02:03:59,102
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1159
02:03:59,269 --> 02:04:02,272
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1160
02:04:02,397 --> 02:04:04,608
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

1161
02:04:04,774 --> 02:04:07,944
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1162
02:04:08,111 --> 02:04:10,697
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1163
02:04:15,410 --> 02:04:17,370
She would do her duty.

1164
02:04:26,421 --> 02:04:28,465
The droid army is in full retreat.

1165
02:04:28,590 --> 02:04:31,676
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

1166
02:04:58,662 --> 02:05:01,748
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1167
02:05:01,915 --> 02:05:03,542
We'll take him together.

1168
02:05:03,708 --> 02:05:05,669
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

1169
02:05:13,844 --> 02:05:17,347
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.

1170
02:05:17,472 --> 02:05:19,349
Now... back down.

1171
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:27,023
I don't think so.

1172
02:05:40,036 --> 02:05:42,539
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1173
02:05:42,706 --> 02:05:45,792
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1174
02:05:48,170 --> 02:05:50,547
Surely you can do better.

1175
02:06:01,766 --> 02:06:03,643
Are you all right?

1176
02:06:03,768 --> 02:06:05,395
Uh-huh.

1177
02:06:06,062 --> 02:06:08,273
We'd better get back
to the forward command centre.

1178
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:09,983
No.

1179
02:06:10,150 --> 02:06:13,653
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1180
02:06:13,779 --> 02:06:15,739
Get a transport. Hurry!

1181
02:06:15,864 --> 02:06:16,865
Right away.

1182
02:06:42,057 --> 02:06:43,850
Brave of you, boy.

1183
02:06:45,185 --> 02:06:47,395
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1184
02:06:47,521 --> 02:06:49,064
I am a slow learner.

1185
02:07:51,585 --> 02:07:53,295
Master Yoda.

1186
02:07:53,462 --> 02:07:56,465
Count Dooku.

1187
02:07:56,631 --> 02:07:59,968
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

1188
02:08:31,291 --> 02:08:34,211
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1189
02:08:34,711 --> 02:08:37,798
The dark side I sense in you.

1190
02:08:37,923 --> 02:08:40,675
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

1191
02:08:41,843 --> 02:08:43,470
Even you.

1192
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:01,863
Much to learn you still have.

1193
02:09:02,030 --> 02:09:05,200
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...

1194
02:09:05,325 --> 02:09:07,536
by our knowledge of the Force...

1195
02:09:09,621 --> 02:09:12,165
but by our skills with a lightsabre.

1196
02:09:53,999 --> 02:09:57,169
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

1197
02:09:57,335 --> 02:09:59,045
This is just the beginning.

1198
02:12:32,282 --> 02:12:34,701
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1199
02:12:35,118 --> 02:12:37,788
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1200
02:12:39,706 --> 02:12:42,000
You have done well.

1201
02:12:42,501 --> 02:12:44,461
I have good news for you, my lord.

1202
02:12:46,004 --> 02:12:49,007
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1203
02:12:49,633 --> 02:12:52,302
Everything is going as planned.

1204
02:13:02,312 --> 02:13:06,233
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

1205
02:13:06,817 --> 02:13:08,777
It doesn't feel right.

1206
02:13:09,152 --> 02:13:12,072
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1207
02:13:13,448 --> 02:13:15,158
Lies, deceit...

1208
02:13:15,283 --> 02:13:18,995
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1209
02:13:19,162 --> 02:13:20,539
Nevertheless...

1210
02:13:20,705 --> 02:13:23,458
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

1211
02:13:23,834 --> 02:13:25,877
I agree.

1212
02:13:27,003 --> 02:13:28,880
Where is your apprentice?

1213
02:13:29,005 --> 02:13:32,843
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1214
02:13:34,678 --> 02:13:38,014
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1215
02:13:38,431 --> 02:13:40,475
Victory?

1216
02:13:41,351 --> 02:13:43,687
Victory, you say?

1217
02:13:43,854 --> 02:13:47,524
