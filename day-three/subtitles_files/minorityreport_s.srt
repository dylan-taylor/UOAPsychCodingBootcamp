1
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,220
You know how blind I am without them.

2
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,014
Howard, don't cry.

3
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,412
Murder.

4
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,072
Good luck, John.

5
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,283
- Any contractions?
- Only the ones you give me.

6
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,216
Okay, Jad, what's coming?

7
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,052
Red Ball, double homicide,
one male, one female.

8
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,221
Killer's male, white, 40s.

9
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,682
Agatha nailed the time frame at 8:04 a.m.

10
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,518
The twins are a little fuzzy on that,
so we'll need confirmation.

11
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,855
Location's still uncertain.
Remote witnesses are plugged in.

12
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,148
This will be case number 1108.

13
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,406
Good morning, detectives.

14
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,368
Case number 1108,
previsualized by the Precogs,

15
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,871
recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's q-stacks.

16
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,998
My fellow witnesses for case number 1108

17
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,064
are Dr. Katherine James
and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

18
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,126
Good morning.

19
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,275
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

20
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,422
Will the witnesses preview
and validate number 1108 at this time?

21
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,967
- Affirmative. I will validate.
- Go get him.

22
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,220
Stand by. time of murder, 8:04 a.m.

23
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,723
That is 24 minutes, 13 seconds from now.

24
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,516
This is a Red Ball.

25
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,170
You know how blind I am without them.

26
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,549
All right, Howard Marks, where are you?

27
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,219
Howard? Howard, breakfast!

28
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,197
"Four score and seven years ago..."

29
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,367
- He looked familiar.
- Who?

30
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:49,455
A man standing in the park
across the street. I've seen him before.

31
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,022
How can you even tell? You know
how blind you are without your glasses.

32
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,125
Where are your glasses?

33
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,835
I must have left them up in the bedroom.

34
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,128
You are running out of time.

35
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,297
You know how blind I am...

36
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,315
I show eight Howard Marks
in the District. Sorting by race and age.

37
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,109
Run their license and registration.

38
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,486
See if I can capture an address here.

39
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,989
You are running out of time.

40
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,555
You know, I was thinking
maybe I'd play hooky, stay home today.

41
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,120
- What about your meeting?
- I've been working too much.

42
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,539
- Can you grab that?
- It's unclear.

43
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,876
I got six licenses. Where do you want them?

44
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,628
Over here, please.

45
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,598
I'm very sorry.

46
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,818
You know how blind I am without them.

47
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,993
Got him in the Foxhall, 4421 Gainsborough.

48
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,494
Send a DCPD blue-and-white.

49
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,394
Set up a perimeter,
and tell them we're en route.

50
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:16,125
You know, I was thinking
maybe I'd play hooky, stay home today.

51
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,336
"We have come
to dedicate a portion of that field..."

52
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,486
- What do you think?
- "...as a final resting place..."

53
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,883
- What about your meeting?
- I'll reschedule.

54
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,323
I've been working too much anyway.

55
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,701
"Is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this."

56
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,681
- "But in a larger sense..." Good.
- We could have lunch together.

57
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:31,913
- What do you say?
- "We cannot consecrate.

58
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,350
"We cannot hallow this ground."

59
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,125
- Any place you want.
- I would love... l would love to.

60
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,604
"The brave men, living and dead..."

61
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,315
I have an open house at the Ressler place.

62
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,486
"Have consecrated it far above
our poor power to add or detract."

63
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,697
I guess that's why you look so nice.

64
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,658
Chief!

65
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,661
We got a problem with our location.

66
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,959
- It's no longer there.
- Shit.

67
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,170
- Time frame?
- Thirteen minutes.

68
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,320
Investigator from the Fed's here.

69
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,572
Yeah, I don't need some twink
from the Fed poking around right now.

70
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,783
John, I wrote it down on your calendar.
I left you a message at your house.

71
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,117
Check in with the papers.
They had it forwarded.

72
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,160
See if the neighbors knew where they went.

73
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,995
- Check all relations.
- Checking neighbors and relations.

74
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,308
- But, John...
- Fletch, just get him some coffee.

75
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,124
Tell him some stories
how I save your ass every day

76
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,464
- and you can't live without me.
- I got coffee, thank you.

77
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,273
Danny Witwer, the twink from the Fed.

78
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,442
Whoops. Gum?

79
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,009
Sorry, Danny, I'm gonna have to give you
the full tour some other time.

80
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,427
The Markses moved a couple of weeks ago,

81
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,116
nobody knows where.
Still searching for family and employer.

82
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,201
Time Horizon, 12 minutes.

83
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,309
All right. What he's doing now,
we call "scrubbing the image,"

84
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,789
looking for clues
as to where the murder's gonna happen.

85
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,668
Original running bond brick pattern,
streamlined early Georgian details...

86
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,169
The brick has been re-pointed.

87
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,844
- And, "That this nation..."
- "This nation..."

88
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,196
- "...under God..."
- "...under God..."

89
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,134
"shall not perish from the Earth."

90
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,719
Victims are pronounced here, killers here.

91
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,596
Beyond that and the date of the crime,

92
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,599
all we have to run on are the images
that they produce.

93
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,736
I show a cop on horseback.

94
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,281
- Near the Capitol?
- No Maglev system.

95
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,615
The Mall?

96
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,909
Georgetown.

97
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,121
The Precogs can see a murder
four days out. Why the late call?

98
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,455
Well, we call it a Red Ball.

99
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,397
With crimes of passion
there's no premeditation,

100
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,584
so they show up late.

101
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,878
Most of our scrambles are flash events,
like this one.

102
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,338
We rarely see anything
with premeditation anymore.

103
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,632
- People have gotten the message.
- Uh-huh.

104
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,050
Oh, this is good.

105
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,928
I show a match for Dwight Kingsley,
18th-century architect.

106
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,555
He did two dozen houses in D.C.

107
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,891
- Time Horizon, 10 minutes.
- Ten minutes.

108
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,434
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

109
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:47,651
Look at this kid. In this one, he's
on the left side of the man in the suit.

110
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,654
- Yes, so?
- This one he is on the right.

111
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,591
Merry-go-round.

112
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,593
It's a park!

113
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,725
Tell me there's only 16 of
these old merry-go-rounds left in the city.

114
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,291
Two in Georgetown, one in Barnaby Woods.

115
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,353
The other's in Woodley.

116
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,294
Woodley's all Victorian.
It's gotta be Barnaby Woods.

117
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,914
- Evanna, flight time?
- The way I drive,

118
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,983
three minutes after wheels up.

119
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,666
- Clear.
- Clear.

120
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,104
Time Horizon, six minutes.

121
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,350
Let's go to bed.

122
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,936
Let's do it in here.

123
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,357
- The bed is soft.
- I'm soft.

124
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,113
Shit!

125
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,533
Which one is it?

126
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,791
- Don't stop!
- Not the bed!

127
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,753
- Come on, come on.
- I don't want to be on the bed!

128
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,032
Time Horizon, one minute.
Chief, we're catching up to the future.

129
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,803
Shut up, Evanna. Jad?

130
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,555
- Jad?
- Go ahead.

131
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,558
- Did he close the front door?
- What?

132
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,019
Did Marks close the front door?

133
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,779
Front door.

134
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,368
I didn't want to be on the bed.

135
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,749
Negative. The front door is open.

136
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,752
- The front door is open.
- Time Horizon, 30 seconds.

137
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,972
- I forgot my glasses.
- Oh, Howard!

138
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,521
No, no, no, Howard.

139
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,027
You know how blind I am without them.

140
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,905
Howard, don't cry.

141
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:03,740
Marks!

142
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,928
Look at me. Look at me.

143
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,643
Positive for Howard Marks.

144
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,981
Mr. Marks, by mandate of the
District of Columbia Precrime Division,

145
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,185
I'm placing you under arrest

146
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,923
for the future murder of Sarah Marks
and Donald Dubin

147
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,946
that was to take place today,
April 22nd, at 0804.

148
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,823
No! I didn't do anything.

149
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,659
- Sarah!
- Give the man his hat.

150
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,788
Oh, God. Don't put that halo on me! Sarah!

151
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,333
- Put your hand on your head!
- Help me!

152
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,335
I wasn't gonna do anything!

153
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,505
Officer Scott, I'm with the
Precrime trauma Response Unit.

154
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,965
I want you to sit here a minute
and listen to me.

155
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,177
Your husband is being arrested
by officers from Precrime.

156
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,054
Oh, God, Howard, no!

157
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:12,184
Howard, don't cry.

158
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,481
Howard, please don't cry.

159
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,525
Oh, God. Oh, God.

160
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,614
I thought they stopped the murder.

161
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,409
Well, that's just an echo,
a Precog déjà vu, if you will.

162
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,288
The really bad ones, the Precogs
see them over and over again.

163
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,415
Wally, erase the incoming.

164
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,225
Imagine a world without murder.

165
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,520
- I lost my best friend.
- I Lost my aunt.

166
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,794
- I Lost my dad.
- I Lost my father.

167
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,814
I Lost my wife.

168
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,525
Just six years ago,
the homicide rate in this country

169
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,610
had reached epidemic proportions.

170
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,738
It seemed that only a miracle
could stop the bloodshed.

171
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:11,326
But instead of one miracle,
we were given three, the Precognitives.

172
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,246
Within just one month
under the Precrime program,

173
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,041
the murder rate in the
District of Columbia was reduced 90%.

174
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,566
They were gonna be waiting for me
in the car.

175
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,586
He was gonna rape me.

176
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,310
- I was going to be stabbed.
- Right here.

177
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:27,217
Within a year, Precrime effectively
stopped murder in our nation's capital.

178
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,429
In the six years we've been conducting
our little experiment,

179
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,015
there hasn't been a single murder.

180
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,601
And now Precrime can work for you.

181
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,769
We want to make absolutely certain

182
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,857
that every American can bank on
the utter infallibility of the system,

183
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:46,903
and to ensure that what keeps us safe
will also keep us free.

184
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,116
- Precrime, it works.
- It works.

185
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,576
- It works.
- It works.

186
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,620
- It works.
- It works.

187
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,581
- Precrime, it works!
- Precrime, it works!

188
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:02,461
On tuesday, April 22nd, vote yes
on the National Precrime Initiative.

189
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,342
What's the matter? Can't sleep?

190
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,643
- I just need a little clarity.
- True, true, true, true, that.

191
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:22,898
You want the customary clarity
or the new-and-improved kind of clarity?

192
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,650
Just give me the new stuff.

193
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,403
New and improved.
New and improved clarity, clarity, clarity.

194
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,489
Yes, indeed, clarity.

195
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,324
Come on, come on. I just want a hit.

196
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,450
Look, don't bust my balls.

197
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,869
You just gave me four,
and some of these are duds.

198
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,829
Sweet dreams, Chief.

199
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,126
Don't worry none,
your secret's safe with me.

200
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,004
Besides, I could use a little juice
on my side.

201
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,298
What do you think you know, Lycon?

202
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,718
It's like my daddy used to say,

203
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,304
"In the land of the blind,

204
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,518
"the one-eyed man is king."

205
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,874
I'm home.

206
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,843
Overhead.

207
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,859
Wall screen.

208
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,951
- Sean!
- Hi, Daddy.

209
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,370
Can you teach me how to run faster?

210
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,041
'Cause all the kids in my class
run faster than me.

211
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,460
No. That's good.

212
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,420
Look, keep your knees up.

213
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,172
Keep your knees up like that. Good.

214
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,298
- Like that.
- Like that.

215
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,884
- Like that. High. High. Like that.
- Like that. High.

216
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,095
- See, you're a natural runner.
- Gotta keep running!

217
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,390
Gotta keep running.

218
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,017
You gotta keep running.

219
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,477
You gotta keep running.

220
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,188
Will I be as fast as you someday?

221
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,232
Oh, I think you'll beat me someday.

222
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,566
You're gonna beat everybody.

223
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,944
I think you'll beat everyone someday.

224
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:17,364
- I gotta go. Bye.
- No, no, no. No, no, no. Wait, wait.

225
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,700
- You gotta give me a kiss.
- Not on the lips!

226
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,620
Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.

227
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,039
Yeah. All right, all right, all right.

228
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,499
I love you.

229
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,419
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Daddy.

230
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,165
It reminds me of Rosarito Beach.

231
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,127
Remember?

232
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,171
Yeah, we had those... We had $20,

233
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:19,926
and waiting in the van
so the sun would shine on our vacation.

234
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,931
John! John.

235
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,269
John, put the camera down. Look, I'm...
I'm all ready for bed.

236
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,563
What... What is this? No.

237
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,566
Put it away.
It's time to put the camera to sleep,

238
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,569
and time to come
and take care of your wife.

239
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,908
Sweetie, why don't you put the camera down

240
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,327
and come and watch the rain with me?

241
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,457
No? I promise I'll make it
a memorable moment.

242
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,256
Look, put the camera down,
or you're not getting anything tonight.

243
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,550
A gentleman at Justice wants
to take all this away from us.

244
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,201
You understand a week from now
people are going to vote

245
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,078
on whether or not
what we've been doing down here

246
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,391
has been some noble-minded enterprise,

247
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,352
or a chance to change the way
this country fights crime.

248
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,437
- I understand, sir.
- John.

249
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,399
Watch this Danny Witwer,

250
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,860
- the observer from Justice.
- Yes, I met him yesterday.

251
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:04,489
You can let him look around,
answer his questions, but watch him.

252
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,241
- Yes, sir.
- And if there's any problem,

253
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,325
- make sure we know about it first.
- I understand.

254
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,726
When the Precogs declare
a victim and a killer,

255
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,622
their name is embedded
in the grain of wood.

256
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,375
Since each piece is unique,
the shape and grain is unique.

257
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,669
The shape and grain is impossible to forge.

258
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,006
I'm sure you all understand the legalistic
drawback to Precrime methodology.

259
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,090
Here we go again.

260
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,259
Look, I'm not with the ACLU on this, Jeff.

261
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,408
But let's not kid ourselves.

262
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,243
We are arresting individuals
who have broken no law.

263
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,245
- But they will.
- The commission of the crime itself

264
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,306
is absolute metaphysics.

265
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,517
The Precogs seethe future,
and they're never wrong.

266
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,938
But it's not the future if you stop it.
Isn't that a fundamental paradox?

267
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,606
Yes, it is.

268
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,818
You're talking about predetermination,
which happens all the time.

269
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,033
- Why'd you catch that?
- Because it was going to fall.

270
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,617
- You're certain?
- Yeah.

271
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,120
But it didn't fall. You caught it.

272
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,104
The fact that
you prevented it from happening

273
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,164
doesn't change the fact
that it was going to happen.

274
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,419
You ever get any false positives?

275
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,964
Someone intends to kill his boss or his
wife, but they never go through with it.

276
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,966
How do the Precogs tell the difference?

277
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,845
The Precogs don't see what
you intend to do, only what you will do.

278
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,931
Then why can't they see rapes?
Or assaults or suicides?

279
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,392
Because of the nature of murder.

280
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,437
"There's nothing more destructive
to the metaphysical fabric that binds us

281
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,398
"than the untimely murder
of one human being by another."

282
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,048
Somehow, I don't think
that was Walt Whitman.

283
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,401
It's Iris Hineman.

284
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:27,197
She developed the Precogs, designed
the system and pioneered the interface.

285
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,991
Speaking of interfacing,
I'd love to say hello.

286
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,327
- To Hineman?
- To them.

287
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,456
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.

288
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,625
Really? You've never been inside?

289
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:42,420
We keep strict separations so that
no one can be accused of tampering.

290
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,173
So, I'll be the first one to go in, then?

291
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,157
- Maybe you didn't hear me.
- If it's a question of authority...

292
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:52,013
No, there is no question.
You don't have any.

293
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,559
I have a warrant in my pocket
that says different.

294
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,740
- Show it to me.
- Sure.

295
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,123
This investigation of Precrime
and its personnel

296
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,083
is being conducted
under the direct supervision

297
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,087
and express permission from the
Attorney General of the United States.

298
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,131
I'm here as his representative,

299
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:30,301
which means you're now operating
under my supervision.

300
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,684
Seems you've been
left out of the loop, John.

301
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,071
All right, we're ready. Let's go.

302
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,121
Hold it right there. Hold it.

303
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,415
Not cleared for access.

304
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,711
Eye-dent, John Anderton. Approved.

305
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,595
- Wally.
- No, no, no, no.

306
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,013
It's okay. This is Danny Witwer.

307
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,329
He's from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.

308
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,349
I can't touch you.

309
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,666
- Don't touch him or anything else.
- John, you can't be in here...

310
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,771
I understand. Just answer his questions
and we'll get the hell out of here.

311
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,856
Tell me how...

312
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,944
- They're sleeping.
- Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

313
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,740
The photon milk acts as both
a nutrient supply and a liquid conductor.

314
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,451
It enhances the images
that each of them receive.

315
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:40,246
We call the female Agatha.
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.

316
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,374
We scan by way of optical tomography.

317
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,211
White-light pinpoints pulse
along the entire length of the headgear,

318
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,756
and they're reread after absorption
through their brain tissue.

319
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,926
In other words, we see what they see.

320
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,511
They don't feel any pain.

321
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,316
We keep their heads pretty well stocked
with dopamine and endorphins.

322
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:02,185
Plus, we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels.

323
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,979
Don't want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep.

324
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,940
They can't be kept too awake, either.

325
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:10,151
It's better if
you don't think of them as human.

326
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,987
No. They're much more than that.

327
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,785
Science has stolen most of our miracles.

328
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:25,041
In a way, they give us hope,
hope of the existence of the divine.

329
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,045
I find it interesting that some people
have begun to deify the Precogs.

330
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,320
The Precogs are
pattern-recognition filters, that's all.

331
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,759
- Yet you call this room "the temple."
- Just a nickname.

332
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,053
The oracle isn't
where the power is, anyway.

333
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,777
The power's always been with the priests,

334
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,516
even if they had to invent the oracle.

335
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,479
You guys are nodding like you actually
know what the hell he's talking about.

336
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:50,066
Well, come on, Chief. The way we work,
changing destiny and all,

337
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,278
I mean, we're more like clergy than cops.

338
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,113
- Jad?
- Yeah?

339
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,782
Go to work. All of you.

340
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,210
Sorry. Old habit.

341
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,714
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary
before I became a cop.

342
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,549
My father was very proud.

343
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,473
What does he think
of your chosen line of work?

344
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,594
I don't know.
He was shot and killed when I was 15

345
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,264
on the steps of our church in Dublin.

346
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,058
I know what it's like
to lose someone close, John.

347
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,394
Of course,
nothing is like the loss of a child.

348
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,751
I don't have any children of my own,

349
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,107
so I can only imagine
what that must have been like.

350
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,652
To lose your son
in such a public place like that.

351
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,593
At least now you and I have
the chance to make sure

352
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,220
that kind of thing
doesn't happen to anyone.

353
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,972
Why don't you cut the cute act,
Danny Boy, and tell me

354
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,493
- exactly what it is you're looking for.
- Flaws.

355
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,726
There hasn't been a murder in six years.

356
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,394
There's nothing wrong with the system.
It is...

357
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,250
Perfect. I agree.
If there's a flaw, it's human.

358
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,003
It always is.

359
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,464
John.

360
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,966
Wally.

361
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,934
Can you see?

362
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,885
John, what the hell just happened?

363
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,576
Her ACTH levels just shot through the roof!

364
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,764
- What did you do to her?
- She grabbed me.

365
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,248
Grabbed you? That's impossible.
The Precogs aren't even aware of us.

366
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,068
- In the milk, all they see is the future.
- She looked straight at me.

367
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,210
It could have been a nightmare.

368
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,106
Sometimes they dream about the old murders.

369
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,191
- She spoke to me.
- To you?

370
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,529
- What'd she say?
- "Can you see?"

371
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,719
You the Sentry?

372
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,221
Yes, sir! I'm Gideon.

373
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,725
You're Chief Anderton.

374
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,603
The music relaxes the prisoners.

375
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,730
Say, I don't ever see
any of you Precops down here.

376
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,566
- I'm not in trouble, am I?
- Not yet.

377
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:23,154
- I'm interested in a murder.
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?

378
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,740
- Drowning.
- That narrows it down.

379
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,366
Not too many in here for that one.

380
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:31,120
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?

381
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,956
I'm supposed to spruce up
for a tour they got planned for tomorrow.

382
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,791
Told me to wear a tie. You like this one?

383
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:36,959
Stop.

384
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,923
Roll back.

385
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,009
There.

386
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:49,764
She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.

387
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,309
This is the official composite
of the three Precogs?

388
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:58,773
That's right! A combined data stream
based on all three previsions.

389
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,983
Just show me Agatha's data stream.

390
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,318
For that,

391
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,780
we go for a ride.

392
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:31,430
My God. I'd forgotten there were so many.

393
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,769
And to think they'd all be out
there killing people if it wasn't for you.

394
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,565
Look at them.
Look at how peaceful they all seem.

395
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,943
But on the inside, busy, busy, busy.

396
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:48,990
Okey-pokey! Now that is one bad man.

397
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,785
He drowned a woman
named Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.

398
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,122
The killer's a John Doe. Never identified.

399
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,307
Why is he still a John Doe?

400
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,475
Why wasn't he ever ID'd from the eye-scan?

401
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,603
On account of those are not his eyes.

402
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,564
He had them swapped out
to fool the scanners.

403
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,610
You can get it done on the street
for a few thousand bucks these days.

404
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:29,655
Okay, so you want
just the female prevision.

405
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,198
That's right.

406
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,790
We don't seem to have her data.

407
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,044
Try again.

408
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,547
This is odd.

409
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:50,301
See? We have the two previsions.

410
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,429
We got what Art saw, we got what Dash saw,

411
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,473
but Agatha's isn't here.

412
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,394
Probably just a glitch.

413
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,773
Tell me about the intended victim,
this Anne Lively.

414
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,153
Looks like she's a neuroin addict,
like our John Doe here,

415
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,573
but I show an address history
that includes the Beaton Clinic.

416
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,242
So she cleaned up. So where's she now?

417
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,747
I guess glitches come in twos.

418
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:26,337
You finally crawl your way out
of one hole just to fall into another.

419
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:32,968
No.

420
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,764
I can't let you take that
out of here, Chief.

421
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,684
It's against the rules.

422
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,270
Anything else going on in here
that's against the rules?

423
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:53,322
Careful, Chief.
You dig up the past, all you get is dirty.

424
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,872
And then you said the third prevision
was, what, kind of fuzzy or something?

425
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:06,127
No. No, the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

426
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,110
That's not all.
I spent a few hours down there,

427
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,048
and there are a dozen more cases
with missing previsions.

428
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:15,302
You'd think we'd have found a cure
for the common cold by now.

429
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,763
- It's stress.
- What's this?

430
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,558
Herbal tea with honey.

431
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,728
I hate herbal tea,
almost as much as I hate honey.

432
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,772
Just drink it before I pour it in your lap.

433
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:29,775
- Can I get you anything, John?
- No, thank you, Celeste.

434
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,904
Witwer's scheduled for a Containment...
Tour of Containment tomorrow.

435
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,198
Yeah, give him a tour.

436
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,452
- Lara called me.
- What?

437
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:43,289
She's worried about you.
Quite frankly, so am l.

438
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,083
I'm fine.

439
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,837
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time in the sprawl.

440
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,341
- I go running down there.
- In the middle of the night?

441
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,719
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now

442
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,264
- and insisted on a full chem run?
- Lamar, I'm fine.

443
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,475
You understand, John,

444
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,978
the minute Precrime goes national,
they're going to take it away from us.

445
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,313
We won't let them.

446
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:11,984
No? How's an old man and a cop
on the whiff ever going to stop them?

447
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,821
My father once said to me,

448
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:20,034
"You don't choose the things
you believe in. They choose you."

449
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,328
There's a reason you are here, John.

450
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,872
Had Precrime been in place
just six months earlier,

451
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,375
the loss you and Lara suffered
would have been prevented.

452
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,252
Remember the eyes...

453
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:35,841
The eyes of the nation are on us right now.

454
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,803
And we both know
I'm not the generation anyone listens to.

455
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,888
But people trust you, John.

456
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,058
When you speak
of your absolute belief in Precrime,

457
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,646
they know it's a belief born of pain,
not politics. I always understood that.

458
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,316
And I may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause.

459
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,030
But now, your pain is hurting both of us.

460
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,704
They're not gonna take it away from us.

461
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,414
I won't let them.

462
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,196
Bingo.

463
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:54,442
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hey, little buddy.

464
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,547
- I made up a club.
- Yeah?

465
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,217
- We're called the Crescos.
- The Crescos.

466
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:03,137
- We made up a soccer team...
- Yeah.

467
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,805
And we practice at school.

468
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,246
Yeah? Do you practice with Connor?

469
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,684
Daddy's in a lot of trouble, Sean.

470
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,377
Wait.

471
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,176
Jad, how come you're not out there
with Father Witwer?

472
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,929
We're in motion on something.
Now, from what I can see,

473
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,599
we got a white male victim,
about 5'10", approximately 170.

474
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,060
He takes a round in the 10-ring
and goes out a window.

475
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,103
- Red Ball?
- Nope, Brown Ball.

476
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,105
- This one's premeditated.
- Amazing.

477
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,964
There's someone within 200 miles
actually dumb enough to still do that.

478
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:02,404
Well, the victim's name is Leo Crow.
This is case number 1109.

479
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,782
Time of occurrence, Friday, 1506 hours.

480
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,474
Start a location run and a contact
search for future victim, Leo Crow.

481
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,120
Case number 1109,
previsualized by the Precogs,

482
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,748
recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's q-stacks.

483
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,792
My fellow witnesses for case number 1109

484
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,336
are Dr. Katherine James
and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

485
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,420
Good morning.

486
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:19,569
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

487
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,863
Are the witnesses ready
to preview and validate number 1109?

488
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,884
- Ready when you are, John.
- Standing by.

489
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,393
Oh, I love this part.

490
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,230
I've got no address,
last known or otherwise,

491
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,649
no tax returns for the last five years.

492
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,318
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.

493
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,739
And send a protection team
as soon as we lock location.

494
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,787
Looks like federal housing.
Concrete, glass, egg crates.

495
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,707
Ouch. About 1,000 of those in the District.

496
00:38:56,418 --> 00:39:00,254
Fractured images coming in. Numbers nine...

497
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,633
Nine and six.

498
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:13,642
Female, senior. She's smoking a pipe.

499
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,395
She's laughing.

500
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,275
Okay, now inside a room.

501
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,029
Window panes, aluminum extrusion.

502
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,615
Two figures resolving in the room.

503
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,201
Wait!

504
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,833
Looks like we got a third party,

505
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,420
wearing sunglasses, just out of the window.

506
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,214
You're not gonna kill me.

507
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,510
Goodbye, Crow.

508
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,601
You're not gonna kill me.
You're not gonna kill me.

509
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,395
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait!

510
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,318
Wait. Wait.

511
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,613
- You say something, Chief?
- No.

512
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,494
I'll get this one.

513
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,996
We got time on this one, Jad.

514
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,124
Mind going down and getting me a piece
of cake they're eating down there?

515
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,251
- I'm starving.
- Sure, Chief.

516
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,088
I think I'll get one for myself
while I'm at it.

517
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,714
Take your time.

518
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,652
Chief Anderton,
what is this that I'm seeing?

519
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,529
I'm confused about...

520
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,728
- Anderton, wait!
- Goodbye, Crow.

521
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,647
Wait! Anderton, wait!

522
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,609
Anderton, wait!

523
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,910
I like you, Chief.
You've always been nice to me.

524
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,083
I'll give you two minutes
before I hit the alarm.

525
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,851
Hold that, please.

526
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,145
Thanks.

527
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,943
- You're in a lot of trouble, John.
- You set me up.

528
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,530
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff
you've been doping on all night.

529
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:17,034
- Easy. Easy.
- Seems I found a flaw.

530
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:20,954
What are you gonna do?

531
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,208
Possession alone will cost you
six months, not to mention your badge.

532
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,793
I guess
we won't be working together after all.

533
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:30,380
Now, put the gun down, John.
I don't hear a Red Ball.

534
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,987
Lamar? Lamar?

535
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,951
- Lamar?
- John, what the hell is happening?

536
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,892
- It's Witwer! He set me up!
- What the hell is happening?

537
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,143
- He set me up.
- Stop. Just wait.

538
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,122
- Who...
- He set me up. Witwer. It's Witwer!

539
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,791
Yeah, who's the victim?

540
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,126
- Somebody.
- Who?

541
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,920
- Somebody. Leo Crow.
- Well, who is he?

542
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,173
I have no idea! I've never heard of him!

543
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,759
But I'm supposed to kill him
in less than 36 hours.

544
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:18,303
Ah. But how could Witwer
have access to case files?

545
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:19,930
Can you fake a cerebral output?

546
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,371
- Why would anyone want to?
- Can you?

547
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,059
- Well, I doubt it very much.
- Well, would Hineman know?

548
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,144
- Listen. Come in.
- What?

549
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,829
Well, I'll keep you safe
until we get to the bottom of this, John.

550
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,921
No, Lamar, Listen to me. Listen.

551
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,006
Talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone
inside the temple again.

552
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,862
Then ask Jad for any off-hour eye-dents
into the analytical room.

553
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,407
Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?

554
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,201
Security lockdown
enabled. Revised destination, office.

555
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,369
Lamar, they found me.

556
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:51,878
Is there any way to override the lockdown?

557
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,839
- No. No. No.
- No?

558
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:57,384
I'll meet you anywhere you say.
You can come to my house, John.

559
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,470
You know I can't. They'll get me there.
I'm not gonna get haloed.

560
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,763
You can't run, John.

561
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,516
Everybody runs.

562
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,856
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey.

563
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,998
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

564
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,629
Don't worry, sir.
I'll bring him in, unharmed.

565
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,547
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.

566
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,716
- I'm taking control of the team.
- What?

567
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:23,136
Witwer, Fletcher is second
in command. It's his show to run.

568
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:26,723
If you want, you can observe. Do it.
Find him.

569
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:28,100
Yes, sir.

570
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:33,897
He came to see you the other day,
right before he was tagged.

571
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,608
- What did you talk about?
- The Mets.

572
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,133
John doesn't think they have
a deep enough pitching roster this year,

573
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,655
- and I'm inclined to agree.
- Why are you protecting him?

574
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,805
You knew he was doping,
yet you did nothing about it.

575
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:47,744
- The man lost a child, for Christ's sake.
- Six years ago.

576
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,247
- What did you two talk about?
- None of your damn business.

577
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,582
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.

578
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,127
Investigation of a supervising officer
for a capital crime

579
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,526
falls under federal jurisdiction,

580
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:59,631
so as to rule out
any possibility of conspiracy.

581
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,092
- He's my suspect.
- He's my subordinate.

582
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,635
Shall we call the Attorney General?

583
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,929
I'm sure he'd be happy
to clarify the issue for you.

584
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,515
I don't want John Anderton hurt.

585
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,728
I'm gonna enjoy working here.

586
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,276
A road diverges in the desert.

587
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:20,986
Lexus.

588
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,823
The road you're on, John Anderton,
is the one less traveled.

589
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:33,415
- Good evening, John Anderton.
- John Anderton.

590
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,127
John Anderton!

591
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,963
You could use a Guinness right about now.

592
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,175
Stressed out, John Anderton?

593
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:49,139
Get away, John Anderton.
Forget your troubles.

594
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,034
He's been eye-dented on the Metro.

595
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,786
The train makes two stops,
at 20th and 33rd.

596
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,330
Send units to each location.

597
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,373
- They'll never make 20th.
- Have faith.

598
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:57,958
Fire them up!

599
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,067
- Hey, Fletch.
- Hey, John.

600
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,611
- That was a rough landing.
- Yeah.

601
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,928
- You have to work on that.
- It's that old, shit knee of mine.

602
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,824
- Yeah.
- Don't do it.

603
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,368
Hey, don't do this.

604
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,830
John? Don't run.

605
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,000
You don't have to chase me.

606
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:41,960
You don't have to run.

607
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:45,797
- Everybody runs, Fletch.
- You know we'll catch you.

608
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,967
Everybody runs.

609
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,347
- It doesn't have to be like this, John.
- Everybody runs.

610
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,267
Get your sick-sticks ready.

611
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,437
Everybody runs, Fletch.

612
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,857
Slow down, Chief. Just take it easy.

613
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,404
No sudden moves, Chief.

614
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,033
John, it's okay.

615
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:15,035
- Fletch...
- Easy does it, Chief.

616
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,900
- Got a grip? Got a grip?
- Yeah.

617
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,095
Chief! Chief, no! Chief!

618
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,098
Anderton!

619
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,089
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!

620
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:55,093
Get that thing out of my house!
Get out of my house! Get out!

621
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,390
Anderton, stop!

622
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,226
Pull him off me, Fletcher. Get him off me.

623
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,355
Do something! try to get them
out of here! What's the matter with you?

624
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:15,447
- John! Stop!
- Get out of my house now!

625
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,470
By mandate of the
District of Columbia Precrime Division,

626
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,430
I'm placing you under arrest...

627
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:41,639
Go to sleep.

628
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,287
Just stay with me.

629
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,143
Dr. Hineman?

630
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,063
You're trespassing. I don't have visitors.

631
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,821
Oh, I'm afraid that would be
from the Doll's Eye, the vine.

632
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,746
The baneberry that scratched you
during your illegal climb over my wall.

633
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,994
It's not a true Doll's Eye, of course.
It's a little hybrid of my own design.

634
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,747
It's quite something. Once the poison
gets into your bloodstream,

635
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,563
you will start to see
what I can only describe

636
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:03,628
as the most extraordinary display
of blue objects.

637
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:08,216
This just isn't your week, is it,

638
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,177
Chief Anderton?

639
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,306
I'm not a killer.

640
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:22,605
You better drink this.

641
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:27,026
Soon you won't be able to swallow,
and then you'll be totally buggered.

642
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,946
All of it.

643
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:33,032
Okay, now take a minute to right yourself.

644
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:38,538
Just what is it you think I can do for you?

645
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:45,419
You can tell me
how someone can fake a prevision.

646
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,713
How would I know that?

647
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,799
Because you invented Precrime.

648
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:54,095
What's so funny?

649
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,890
If the unintended consequences
of a series of genetic mistakes

650
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,726
and science gone haywire
can be called invention,

651
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,812
yes, then I invented Precrime.

652
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,897
- You don't seem all that proud.
- I'm not.

653
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,733
I was trying to heal them,
not turn them into something else.

654
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:08,818
Heal who?

655
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,279
The innocents we now use
to stop the guilty.

656
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:14,365
You're talking about the Precogs.

657
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:17,285
You think the three in the tank
come out of a test tube?

658
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,996
They are merely the ones who survived.

659
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,498
I was doing genetic research
at the Woodhaven Clinic,

660
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:23,958
treating children of drug addicts.

661
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,336
This was 10 years ago,
when neuroin first hit the streets.

662
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,965
It was an impure form of the drug,
not the engineered cocktail

663
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:34,427
that became so popular
among the more educated.

664
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:38,264
All of these kids were born
with severe brain damage.

665
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,017
Most died before the age of 12.

666
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,103
Those few, those precious few
who survived, they had a gift.

667
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:47,690
I call it a gift. For them,
it was more like a cosmic joke.

668
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,507
They would wake up in the night,
curled up in the corner of their rooms,

669
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,361
screaming, clawing at the wallpaper.

670
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:56,866
Because when these little children,
you see, closed their eyes at night,

671
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,746
they dreamt only of murder,
over and over, one after the other.

672
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:05,082
And it didn't take long for us to
realize that the real nightmare

673
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:08,294
was tha tthese so-called dreams
were about to come true.

674
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,963
These murders were actually happening.

675
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:17,094
You say some of the children died.

676
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,431
So many of them,
despite what we did for them.

677
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:24,894
Or maybe because of what we did
to them. But it doesn't matter.

678
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,521
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

679
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,400
I'm not going to commit murder.

680
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,694
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kill.

681
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,696
And yet a chain of events has started,

682
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,241
a chain that will lead you inexorably
to his murder.

683
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,445
Not if I stay away from him.

684
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,974
How can you avoid a man you've never met?

685
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,078
So you won't help me?

686
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:46,999
I can't help you. Nobody can.
The Precogs are never wrong.

687
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:51,462
But occasionally,

688
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,173
they do disagree.

689
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,051
What?

690
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:02,098
Most of the time, all three Precognitives
will see an event in the same way,

691
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:06,143
but once in a while, one of them will
seething differently than the other two.

692
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:09,689
Jesus Christ. Why didn't I know about this?

693
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,610
Because these minority reports
are destroyed the instant they occur.

694
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:15,945
Why?

695
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,197
Obviously, for Precrime to function,

696
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,783
there can't be
any suggestion of fallibility.

697
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,245
After all, who wants a justice system
that instills doubt?

698
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,206
It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.

699
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,460
Are you saying I've haloed innocent people?

700
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:35,339
I'm saying that every so often
those accused of a Precrime

701
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:38,342
might, just might,
have an alternate future.

702
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:42,888
Does Burgess know about this?
About this minority report?

703
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:46,267
I used to joke with Lamar that we were
the mother and father of Precrime.

704
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,061
Well, in my experience,
parents very often see their children

705
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,022
as they want them to be, not as they are.

706
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,606
Answer my question.

707
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:56,444
Does Lamar Burgess know
about the minority report?

708
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:58,612
Yes, of course, he knew.

709
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,656
But at the time, he felt, we both felt,

710
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:03,951
that their existence
was an insignificant variable.

711
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:05,786
Insignificant to you, maybe,

712
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:09,999
but what about those people
that I put away with alternate futures?

713
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,460
My God, if the country knew
there was a chance...

714
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,545
The system would collapse.

715
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,883
- I believe in that system.
- Do you really?

716
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,092
You want to bring it down.

717
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:24,180
You will bring it down,
if you manage to kill your victim.

718
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:27,516
Why, that will be
the most spectacular public display

719
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,894
of how Precrime didn't work.

720
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:33,147
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- Hold that thought.

721
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,523
Why should I trust you?

722
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,359
You shouldn't. You shouldn't trust anyone.

723
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,570
Certainly not the Attorney General,
who just wants it all for himself.

724
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,698
And not the young federal agent
who wants your job.

725
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,618
Not even the old man who just wants
to hang onto what he created.

726
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,747
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the minority report.

727
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,627
You said the minority report's destroyed.

728
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,172
The record is destroyed.
The original report still exists.

729
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:01,050
I designed the system
so that whenever a report occurred,

730
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,011
it would be stored in a safe place,
but not declared.

731
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:06,055
What safe place is that?

732
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:09,225
The safest place there is.

733
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,019
Where is it?

734
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,234
Inside the Precog who predicted it.

735
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:27,326
All you have to do is download it, darling.

736
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,288
That's all, huh?

737
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,753
Just walk right into Precrime,
get in the temple,

738
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:42,425
somehow tap into these Precogs,
and then download this minority report.

739
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,219
- If you have one.
- And then walk out.

740
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:50,141
Actually, I think you'll have to run out,
but, yes, that is what you have to do.

741
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,184
You're insane.

742
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,020
Or you think I am.

743
01:02:55,814 --> 01:03:01,026
I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times
before I get within 10 miles of Precrime!

744
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:06,073
Sometimes, in order to see the light,
you have to risk the dark.

745
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:09,452
As a policeman...
Oh, excuse me, as a former policeman,

746
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:12,037
I'm sure that you know all sorts of people

747
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,707
who can help you out in this regard.

748
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,675
It's funny
how all living organisms are alike.

749
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:28,762
When the chips are down,
when the pressure is on,

750
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:33,267
every creature on the face of the Earth
is interested in one thing

751
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,060
and one thing only.

752
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:38,230
Its own survival.

753
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,526
Find the minority report.

754
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:50,493
How do I even know which one has it?

755
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:53,454
It's always in the more gifted
of the three.

756
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,208
Which one is that?

757
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,754
The female.

758
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:06,787
All right, here's where we're at.

759
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,886
Three men in a room. The victim is here.

760
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:13,807
John is here. And this unidentified male,
out the window.

761
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,935
Now, the adjacent building
suggests public housing,

762
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,876
but I can't make out the location,
which means...

763
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,377
There's thousands of units like this one.

764
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,689
Yeah, they're everywhere.

765
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:23,150
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow
for another 22 hours.

766
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:24,466
Excuse me, this is Chief Anderton's space.

767
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,528
Casey, he's okay.

768
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,177
- You can't sit in his space.
- He's not here anymore.

769
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,531
- He'll be back.
- I doubt that.

770
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:29,846
- What happened to you?
- It's okay.

771
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,015
In the meantime, I'm betting
he's somewhere in the sprawl.

772
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,142
Anderton's smart enough to
go where electronic billboards

773
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,894
and other media can't ID him
to pick his pockets.

774
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:38,480
There's fewer consumers there, which
means fewer scanners to target him.

775
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,044
- Why won't he just run?
- Because he thinks he's innocent.

776
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,131
We concentrate on the sprawl.

777
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:49,385
Do flyovers in shifts
with two spyder teams on the ground.

778
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:53,764
Thermal scan the entire area,
read anything with eyes and a heartbeat.

779
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:10,823
Where is she?

780
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,394
This damn cold!

781
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:43,480
Don't worry.

782
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:46,483
You see, I could cut open your chest
and sew a dead cat in there,

783
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:47,757
you would never get an infection.

784
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,488
Not with the spectrum of antibios
I'll be shooting into you.

785
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,032
That's comforting.

786
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:56,619
You do understand
I can't just give you new irises.

787
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,120
Please don't touch.

788
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,790
Because the scanners will read
the new scar tissue, alarms will go off,

789
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,668
and large men with guns will appear.

790
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,674
What was that? What was that?

791
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:13,969
It's anesthesia.
It's all gonna be downhill from...

792
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,869
You always sneak up
on your patients like that?

793
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:19,391
You wouldn't break the hand
of a violinist before the concert.

794
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:20,893
Please, relax.

795
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:30,611
All I'm trying to tell you is that
I'll have to remove your eyes completely.

796
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,738
I know.

797
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:35,388
And I'll have to replace them
with new ones.

798
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,493
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.

799
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,661
Why?

800
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,872
Because my mother gave them to me.

801
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,147
What's it to you? They're no good
in the secondary market anyway.

802
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,585
Whatever you say. It's your money.

803
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:57,971
Let me introduce my gorgeous assistant,
Miss Van Eyck.

804
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:23,956
- This is not a lot of money.
- It's all that I could safely move.

805
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,466
What did you give me?

806
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:38,846
Smile medicine. Tell you what,
since you and I go way back,

807
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:43,142
why don't I just give you my
"old pal" discount? What do you say?

808
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,436
You don't remember me, do you?

809
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,105
- We know each other?
- Oh, yes, we do.

810
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,567
From where? D.C.?

811
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,777
- Baltimore. East side.
- Baltimore?

812
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:56,363
- Yeah.
- How do we go way back?

813
01:07:56,448 --> 01:08:00,534
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D.
I was a plastic surgeon.

814
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:05,122
You remember? I specialized
in burn victims, mostly women.

815
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:09,084
- I put you away.
- Oh, yeah. You did.

816
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,338
You made those tapes.

817
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:16,508
They were performance pieces.

818
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:21,680
- You set your patients on fire.
- I put them out!

819
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:26,852
Some not as quickly as others,
but let's change the subject, shall we?

820
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:34,526
The future is so much more interesting
than the past, don't you think?

821
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:41,033
Miss van Eyck,
I'm afraid she's already smitten.

822
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:46,121
She only has eyes for you.

823
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:51,460
I know what you're thinking, John.
How can I do what I do now?

824
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:56,298
Well, let's say that I did spend
an awful lot of time in the prison library.

825
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,466
Now that was a great way

826
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:01,970
to avoid some of the more unpleasant
aspects of prison life.

827
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:05,098
Confinement was a real education, a real

828
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:08,811
eye-opener.

829
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:18,195
I mean, for true enlightenment,
there's nothing quite like, well, let's say,

830
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,573
taking a shower
while this large felon with an attitude

831
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,325
you can't even knock down with a hammer

832
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,203
whispers in your ear,
"Oh, Nancy. Oh, Nancy."

833
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,663
Now, that was a lot of fun.

834
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,915
Thank you so very much, John,
for putting me there.

835
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,042
Thank you so very much
for giving me the opportunity

836
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,169
to get to know myself so much better.

837
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:36,421
And now, to return the favor.

838
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,602
- This your work?
- Yes.

839
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,564
I like it.

840
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,024
Thanks. You take anything in your coffee?

841
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,694
- Cream and sugar.
- I don't have any cream. Sorry.

842
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,737
Just sugar, then.
You and John ever come here?

843
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:04,199
- We used to, every summer.
- He's not here now, is he?

844
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,953
I had to ask.

845
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:12,564
You know, I don't have any sugar, either.

846
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:13,750
Thank you.

847
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:17,212
- He hasn't tried to contact you?
- No.

848
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:19,882
You ever heard him
mention the name Leo Crow?

849
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,885
No, but then
I don't talk to John that much anymore.

850
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,012
So you haven't seen his apartment?

851
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:27,848
- That was our apartment.
- Have you been there recently?

852
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:31,101
It's full of these.
How long has he been doping?

853
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:36,440
- Since right after we lost our son.
- You mean after he lost your son.

854
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,610
It was nobody's fault.

855
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:45,490
But John was with him at the public pool.

856
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:48,744
You said in your divorce papers
that John tried to kill himself.

857
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:50,078
It wasn't a suicide attempt.

858
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:52,247
- I regret ever saying that.
- Then what was it?

859
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:55,584
The FBI found something that
belonged to my son, a sandal.

860
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,587
Anyway, John was upset. He...

861
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,653
He took out his gun and sat down
and watched his home movies.

862
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,966
- He shot...
- This is all in your statement, Lara.

863
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:05,552
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling.
So what?

864
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:08,847
You lose your son,
let's see how well you handle it.

865
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,558
Lamar Burgess thinks you left John

866
01:11:11,643 --> 01:11:14,186
because he lost himself
in Precrime instead of you.

867
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:20,108
I left him because every time
I looked at him, I saw my son.

868
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:24,863
Every time I got close to him,
I smelled my little boy.

869
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,908
That's why I left him.

870
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,328
And now you can leave.

871
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:36,333
Don't take the bandages off for 12 hours.

872
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:46,009
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

873
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:51,014
In the fridge there's milk,
and Greta made you a sandwich.

874
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:53,475
Make sure you drink a lot of water.

875
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:56,603
How do I find the bathroom?

876
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:59,398
The bathroom? Now that's your right hand.

877
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:04,820
The kitchen is your left.

878
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:10,242
Don't scratch. Never scratch!

879
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:14,060
Seeing as we're being old pals and all,
I'm going to give you a bonus.

880
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,789
It might come in handy.

881
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,874
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme.

882
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,358
You're gonna shoot this baby up there,
right under your chin.

883
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:21,378
What is this?

884
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:23,714
It's gonna turn your pretty face into mush.

885
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:26,466
People won't even recognize you, okay?

886
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,093
In 30 minutes, it'll tighten up again,

887
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,054
but it's gonna hurt like
nothing you've ever felt before.

888
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:36,268
Gonna put this in your goodie bag,
together with your leftovers.

889
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:42,024
I'm setting up a timer.
When it rings tomorrow,

890
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,568
you can take off the bandages
and get the hell out of here,

891
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:48,655
- but not before then, or you'll...
- Go blind, I know.

892
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,407
Don't scratch.

893
01:12:51,743 --> 01:12:55,912
A little something
from a mutual friend of ours.

894
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,786
Don't take the bandages off for 12 hours.

895
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:41,291
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

896
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:05,440
25.16 seconds. That's a new record.

897
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:06,942
Is that a world record?

898
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:10,612
Is it a world record? It's a personal best.

899
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,572
Okay, now I want to time you.

900
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:13,763
You wanna time me? You gotta be kidding.

901
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:17,077
'Cause there's no possible way
I can beat 25.16 seconds.

902
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:19,996
How long can a whale
hold its breath underwater?

903
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:22,415
A whale can hold its breath for
about 20 minutes.

904
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,168
- So we gotta beat the whale.
- Okay.

905
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,381
We gotta beat the whale.

906
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:33,135
Here you go.
Now, that's gonna be 20 minutes.

907
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,118
You sure you don't want to go
for an ice cream or something?

908
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:36,471
- No.
- Because you know,

909
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:38,849
- you know I'm going to beat that whale.
- Yeah.

910
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:40,706
- Okay, give me the count.
- Ready?

911
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,353
- Give me the count.
- Three, two, one, go.

912
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:06,626
Sean?

913
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,047
Sean!

914
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:16,428
Sean?

915
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:19,139
Have you seen...

916
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,392
Sean! I'm looking for my son.

917
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:25,228
Have you seen a boy in a red bathing suit?

918
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,022
Sean!

919
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,817
He's wearing a red bathing suit.

920
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:37,490
Sean!

921
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:41,411
Sean...

922
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,344
Jad, we are now in position
and ready to begin thermal scan

923
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:23,638
on all residences on North Powell.

924
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:27,267
I'm thinking you must
really like me, don't you, Fletcher?

925
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:30,228
That's why you asked to partner
with me on this little sortie, isn't it?

926
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:31,855
I think you're swell company, Knott.

927
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:34,983
It's not that you don't trust me
to be alone with the Chief, is it?

928
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,402
That you think I might futz with him
if I had the chance?

929
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,177
No, I just want to watch him use your
body to sandblast another building.

930
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,824
That's all, Jeff. Evanna, go.

931
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:46,953
I show 27 warm bodies.

932
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:49,539
Roger that. Confirm 27 warm bodies.

933
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,833
What do you think? Four spyders?
One per floor?

934
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:54,252
Let's do eight. I gotta eat.

935
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:13,188
Residents of 931 Powell,
residents of 931 Powell.

936
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:15,857
This is Officer Fletcher of D.C. Precrime.

937
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,860
Under authority P.C. Section 6409,

938
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,363
we are deploying spyders into your complex.

939
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:24,616
- Go, go, go, baby.
- Mom, I'm scared.

940
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,369
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.

941
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,769
Come on, it's gonna scan you.
Keep your eyes open. Just stay still.

942
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:32,374
Stay still, baby. Open your eyes.
It's okay.

943
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,834
- I don't like it.
- Stay still, stay still.

944
01:18:57,108 --> 01:19:00,443
Come on! You can't just come
barging in here like that! Come on!

945
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:02,779
You have stepped out on me
for the last time.

946
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:04,906
I told you where I was!
Now get off my back!

947
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:08,660
You're a no good liar!
I know you was with that ho last night.

948
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,667
- Leave me alone!
- Get out of here!

949
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,037
We lost one.

950
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:38,082
Roger that. Maybe it was a cat jumping
through a window or something.

951
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,169
- That's an awful big cat.
- Fletcher.

952
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:44,464
I'll go check it out.

953
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:24,693
They're crying their eyes out.

954
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,820
You terrified them.
They're absolutely terrified right now!

955
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,360
You don't want your kids to know terror,
keep them away from me.

956
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:46,442
Wait a minute. The big cat's back.

957
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:49,070
What do you guys think,
a drunk, maybe can't wake up?

958
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,322
Yeah, some guy
who doesn't want to get read.

959
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:54,242
Folks, please be quiet.
Close your doors. Go back inside.

960
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,422
Be quiet and close the door!

961
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:16,764
We got an ID. It's not him.

962
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:19,934
Standing down.

963
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,227
Let's eat.

964
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:23,354
Anderton, wait!

965
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:37,201
Fletcher, take a look.

966
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:42,290
There's four people in this room,
not three.

967
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:46,461
Four? There's Anderton, there's Crow
and there's the man with sunglasses.

968
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:49,380
Here's the man with sunglasses
outside the window.

969
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:56,179
There's also someone here, in the mirror.

970
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:58,890
Yeah. Definitely female.

971
01:23:00,059 --> 01:23:04,395
The Precrime Program began
in the year 2046 with a federal grant.

972
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,689
And now, nine years later,

973
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:09,817
the District of Columbia is
the safest city in America.

974
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:12,487
Why? Because Precrime works.

975
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:16,074
Precrime has eliminated the need
for conventional detectives,

976
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:17,825
so most of what happens now

977
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,870
is the verification and the protection
of the future victim.

978
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:22,330
Can we see the Precogs?

979
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:25,166
Well, the Precogs have such a powerful gift

980
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,066
that they have to be kept
in peaceful seclusion

981
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:29,420
so as not to be distracted
from the outside world.

982
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:33,925
But this display is to give you some idea
of what their daily life is like.

983
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:38,805
The Precogs get over
eight million pieces of mail every year,

984
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:40,807
more mail than Santa Claus gets.

985
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:44,352
Each Precog has their own bedroom,
television and weight room.

986
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,896
It really is wonderful to be a Precog.

987
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,174
My mom's new boyfriend
came over again last night.

988
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:17,218
He's just not a very intelligent person.

989
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:19,118
My mom wouldn't let me go upstairs
and eat in my room.

990
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:20,786
She made me sit down there the entire time,

991
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:23,474
having to listen to him
go on and on and on.

992
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:35,069
Shit! Shit, shit, shit.

993
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:54,672
Eye-dent, John Anderton.
Approved for entry.

994
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:58,342
I want to get a new dog.

995
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,595
Which I told her I should be able to do

996
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:02,286
because I'm so good
at taking care of you guys.

997
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:06,058
But she thinks that I'll be irresponsible,
which is ridiculous.

998
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:14,525
No, no, no, no! You can't be in here!
No, no! What are you doing here?

999
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:19,155
No, no, no, no!

1000
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:22,014
Easy there, old-timer. Who cleared you?
You are not supposed to be in here.

1001
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,285
- Listen, Wally.
- Do I know you? Who are you?

1002
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:28,247
I like you, Wally. So, I don't want to have
to kick you or hit you with anything hard,

1003
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:30,500
but only if you promise to help me.

1004
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:33,711
Hi, John.

1005
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:44,680
Who does that look like to you?

1006
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:47,767
I don't know.

1007
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:53,815
It's Agatha.

1008
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:56,067
He's coming here to get her.

1009
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:01,864
- Are these all of her previsions?
- I'm rewinding her right now.

1010
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,892
I don't need to see all these.
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

1011
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,560
I'm looking.
They're not coming out in any order.

1012
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,414
I'm just getting them as she's giving.

1013
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,087
Can you see?

1014
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:32,353
- He's inside.
- He's got some kind of mask on.

1015
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:33,980
He sealed the door from the inside.

1016
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:36,190
Shit! Nobody fires a weapon
inside the temple.

1017
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:39,007
Use only bindfoam or your sick-sticks.
Is there another way out of there?

1018
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,218
We've got all the doors covered.
There's no way he's getting out.

1019
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:44,031
John, move away from the tank!

1020
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,617
Move away from the tank, John!

1021
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,254
No, no, no, no, no. No!

1022
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:02,466
No! No, no, no, no, no!

1023
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,368
- What does he want with the Precog?
- What do you think?

1024
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:09,765
So he can kill whoever he wants to
without anyone knowing about it!

1025
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,475
But there's still the other two.

1026
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:15,062
Wally! Wally!
The other two can still function, right?

1027
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:17,064
You don't understand. They're a hive mind.

1028
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:20,610
It takes all three
for their predictive abilities to work.

1029
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,345
Are you telling me
they can't see murders anymore?

1030
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,451
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males,
but Agatha, she's the key.

1031
01:27:28,535 --> 01:27:31,579
She's the one they listen to,
the one with the most talent.

1032
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,497
She takes care of the other two.

1033
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:35,791
Jesus. Agatha.

1034
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,209
Please, bring her back.

1035
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:39,902
Find out where that pipe leads.
I want every team underground, now!

1036
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:41,047
It doesn't matter, he wins.

1037
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:43,322
No, no. I'll send my men to EVAC.
We'll stop him in the reservoir.

1038
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:45,760
Gordon, she's in the room with him
when he kills Crow.

1039
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:48,095
She's already a part of his future.

1040
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:50,306
Jad, put everything you've got
into finding that room,

1041
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,599
and we stop a murder.

1042
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:56,812
- How much time have we got, Gordon?
- We've got 51 minutes, 30 seconds.

1043
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:01,108
You cold?

1044
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:04,987
Can you understand me? Are you cold?

1045
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:07,448
The shivers, it's the drugs we gave you.

1046
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,116
It should wear off soon.

1047
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:13,037
I'm sorry. I need your help.
You contain information.

1048
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,206
I need to know how to get at it.

1049
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:19,627
Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?
Can you tell me if...

1050
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,629
- Is it now?
- What?

1051
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,089
Is it now?

1052
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:28,177
Yes, this is all happening right now.

1053
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,681
We've gotta take you some place in public,

1054
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:34,475
which means I've gotta get you
something else to wear.

1055
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:37,812
I'm tired. I'm tired of the future.

1056
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:47,822
Hello, Mr. Yakamoto.
Welcome back to the Gap!

1057
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:50,366
How'd those assorted tank tops
work out for you?

1058
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:53,744
Mr. Yakamoto?

1059
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,001
Hey, Miss Belford, did you come back

1060
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,753
for another pair of those Shimmy Lace Ups?

1061
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:19,854
If he's ransoming her,
where's the damn note?

1062
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,939
It has nothing to do with ransom.

1063
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:25,192
It has to do with the information
that's inside of Agatha.

1064
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,738
He's trying to prove his innocence.

1065
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,282
But he can't download her
without a lot of technical support.

1066
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:34,076
Well, your average consumer
can't buy any of this stuff

1067
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:36,203
because it's been assembled and scrounged

1068
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,414
from spare parts made to order.

1069
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:43,627
Assuming Anderton ordered this,
who put it together?

1070
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:55,848
Who's Rufust. Riley?

1071
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,125
What's your pleasure? We got it all here.

1072
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:01,437
We got sports fantasies.

1073
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:04,023
We got what I like to call
"Look, Ma, I can fly" fantasies,

1074
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:06,067
which encompasses
everything from bungee jumping

1075
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,360
to soaring like an eagle
over the Grand Canyon.

1076
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:10,635
We got guys coming in
wanting to experience sex as a woman.

1077
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,804
We got women coming, wanna get laid
by their favorite soap star.

1078
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:16,952
Or just some good, clean fun.

1079
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:20,331
Yeah.

1080
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,417
It's a big rush, but you come out
the other side without a heart attack.

1081
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:26,170
I want to kill my boss.

1082
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,672
Uh-huh. Okay.

1083
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,425
You got some images I can work with?

1084
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:33,135
Rufus!

1085
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:37,098
Yeah, being concert master for
the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra

1086
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:38,724
is one of our most popular choices.

1087
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:40,768
No, no, no. I want to kill my boss.

1088
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,103
You sick bastard!

1089
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:45,356
You're the kind of person that
makes this a terrible world to live in!

1090
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,191
Detective, nice of you to come down here,

1091
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:49,508
seeing how every cop in the world
is looking for you right now.

1092
01:30:49,528 --> 01:30:50,694
I need your help.

1093
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,219
Why did you have to come
all the way down here?

1094
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,156
Chief, I make house calls. You know that.

1095
01:30:54,241 --> 01:30:57,409
- I need your help with her.
- Well, hello there, honeypie.

1096
01:30:57,911 --> 01:30:59,631
I'm impressed, Anderton.
You're on the I am,

1097
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:03,749
and you still have the time and energy
to slice off a little jerky for yourself.

1098
01:31:04,251 --> 01:31:08,754
- She's a Precog.
- Yeah. Okay. She's a Precog.

1099
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:14,718
You brought a Precog here.

1100
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:30,734
Jesus Christ.

1101
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,780
- Are you reading my mind right now?
- Get up.

1102
01:31:34,865 --> 01:31:36,012
I'm sorry for whatever I'm going to do,

1103
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:38,784
and I swear I didn't do
any of that stuff I did.

1104
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:46,375
She's got information inside of her.
I need you to get it out.

1105
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:49,837
No way, man. No.
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1106
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:53,716
Those thoughts about my cousin Elena,
they were just thoughts.

1107
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,490
You've been busted twice
for felony hacking.

1108
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,345
- So?
- So, I need you to hack into her.

1109
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:04,810
I tell you what. I do this,

1110
01:32:04,895 --> 01:32:07,313
I get to keep whatever images
I get from her head.

1111
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:09,106
They don't belong to anybody.

1112
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:10,608
Take her to RadioShack.

1113
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,111
Rufus, you gotta help me.

1114
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:24,830
Agatha, I need to see. I need to see
what's going to happen to me.

1115
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:27,708
And then we'll go.

1116
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:45,351
- Wow. She works.
- Slow it down.

1117
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:50,022
How do I slow this down?
I should hit her on the head?

1118
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:59,240
- Are you recording this?
- Shit.

1119
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:01,492
Yeah, recording.

1120
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:30,896
I know this already. Come on, move on.

1121
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:38,112
Goodbye, Crow.

1122
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:48,706
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1123
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,374
- What happened?
- I...

1124
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,793
- Where's the rest of it?
- I guess that's all of it.

1125
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,215
Where's my minority report?

1126
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,761
Do I even have one?

1127
01:34:08,018 --> 01:34:10,894
- Do I have one?
- No.

1128
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:14,815
- What?
- No.

1129
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:26,535
What? Agatha, what?

1130
01:34:28,038 --> 01:34:30,581
- Can you see?
- See what?

1131
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:48,223
Anne Lively.

1132
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:59,276
You want me to see who killed Anne Lively.

1133
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:01,195
Are you recording this?

1134
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,572
Yeah, but look,
it's pouring out of her backwards.

1135
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:12,122
I like my life. Everything is good.

1136
01:35:23,593 --> 01:35:25,260
They're inside.

1137
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:27,262
Who?

1138
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:30,224
All your old teammates.

1139
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:33,143
Get in, left chamber.

1140
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,521
- Hey, close the door!
- Negative!

1141
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,232
- Negative!
- Negative!

1142
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:39,798
Thank you, I don't deserve that.
I'm gonna cry.

1143
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:41,007
- You are the man.
- No, you're the man.

1144
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:42,627
- No, you are the man.
- You are the man.

1145
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,328
Can you see the umbrella?

1146
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:55,207
Take it!

1147
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:01,171
A man in a blue suit.

1148
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,674
He drops his briefcase.

1149
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:15,352
You see a woman in a brown dress.
She knows your face.

1150
01:36:16,855 --> 01:36:18,355
Turn in here.

1151
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:26,738
Let's go.

1152
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:33,454
Wait.

1153
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:36,039
- No, we can't stop here.
- You see the balloon man?

1154
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:44,298
Wait.

1155
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,259
What are we waiting for?

1156
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:53,765
Wait. Wait.

1157
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:55,893
Wait.

1158
01:36:56,686 --> 01:36:58,937
- Please, Mommy, can I have one?
- All right.

1159
01:37:02,442 --> 01:37:03,609
Wait.

1160
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:10,073
Thank you.

1161
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:12,826
- Anybody got an ID? Anybody?
- Negative.

1162
01:37:12,911 --> 01:37:14,161
- Negative.
- Negative.

1163
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,163
All right. Scott, Ramos, take the east end.

1164
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:18,332
Everyone else, follow me. Let's go.

1165
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:32,804
He knows. Don't go home.

1166
01:37:41,648 --> 01:37:42,898
We've got eyes on.

1167
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:45,734
They're working,
but they're standing on it.

1168
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:50,405
- Please! Please! Have you got a coin?
- Drop some money.

1169
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:56,328
Can't you put it in my hand?

1170
01:37:56,412 --> 01:37:59,081
May the Lord bless you.

1171
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:02,793
May God take care of you.

1172
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:23,814
Damn!

1173
01:38:52,635 --> 01:38:56,221
That's the guy. The man in the window.

1174
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:11,695
Hey. Hey.

1175
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:15,782
- Rooms are $95 a night, plus tax.
- Mind if I look at the registry?

1176
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:17,784
Yeah, I mind.

1177
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:20,287
How about now?

1178
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:22,205
Help yourself.

1179
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:37,638
He's here.

1180
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,848
Anderton, leave.

1181
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:50,108
You have a choice. Walk away. Do it now.

1182
01:39:50,193 --> 01:39:53,403
I can't. I have to know. I have to find out
what happened in my life.

1183
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:55,030
Please.

1184
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:59,242
Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man.
I don't even know him.

1185
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:01,578
- What room is Crow in?
- I006.

1186
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:05,332
Come on. Come on.

1187
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:26,663
Wrong room.

1188
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,361
Leave. Leave.

1189
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:56,837
Oh, God.

1190
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:05,303
This is Sean, my son.

1191
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:14,479
Every day for the last six years,
I've thought about only two things.

1192
01:43:16,649 --> 01:43:20,527
The first is what my son would
look like if he were alive today,

1193
01:43:22,071 --> 01:43:25,490
if I would recognize him
if I saw him on the street,

1194
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:32,873
and second is what I would do
to the man who took him.

1195
01:43:37,879 --> 01:43:39,462
You're right.

1196
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:42,841
I'm not being set up.

1197
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:47,721
You have to take me home.

1198
01:43:48,097 --> 01:43:50,640
No. No.

1199
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:57,772
You said so yourself.
There is no minority report.

1200
01:43:57,857 --> 01:44:00,567
I don't have an alternate future.

1201
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:04,362
I am going to kill this man.

1202
01:44:07,325 --> 01:44:11,578
You still have a choice.
The others never saw their future.

1203
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:13,747
You still have a choice.

1204
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:17,918
- Leo Crow?
- Who the hell are you?

1205
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:25,800
Six years ago, Baltimore,
you grabbed up a kid

1206
01:44:25,885 --> 01:44:28,386
at Francis Public Pool in the West End.

1207
01:44:29,722 --> 01:44:31,640
Did I? I don't know.

1208
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:34,392
I don't remember anything about that place.

1209
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:42,067
Who am I? Who am I? Do you know who I am?

1210
01:44:42,151 --> 01:44:45,695
- You're somebody's father.
- His name is Sean!

1211
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,574
Sean!

1212
01:44:49,659 --> 01:44:52,452
I told him I was a policeman.
I told him I needed his help.

1213
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:55,872
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song.
I bought him a pretzel.

1214
01:44:55,957 --> 01:44:57,958
I bought him a pretzel.

1215
01:44:58,042 --> 01:45:00,627
He was happy. He was happy.

1216
01:45:00,711 --> 01:45:03,880
Is he alive? He's alive.
Where have you got him?

1217
01:45:03,965 --> 01:45:07,008
Is he all right?
Tell me, you fuck, where is he?

1218
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:10,512
I put him in a barrel.
I sunk him in the bay.

1219
01:45:11,389 --> 01:45:14,683
He floated back up. I took him out.

1220
01:45:14,767 --> 01:45:17,185
I was gentle. I was gentle.

1221
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:20,563
I was gentle.

1222
01:45:25,653 --> 01:45:29,239
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1223
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:33,326
I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry.

1224
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,456
How could you do that to my...

1225
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:03,732
I'm sorry.

1226
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:18,705
You can choose.

1227
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:40,351
You have the right to remain silent.

1228
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:44,564
Anything you say or do can be
used against you in a court of law.

1229
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,859
You have the right to an attorney,

1230
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:51,946
now and during any further questioning.

1231
01:46:52,698 --> 01:46:55,742
If you can't afford an attorney,

1232
01:46:57,953 --> 01:46:59,954
we will appoint one.

1233
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:04,125
Do you understand these rights?

1234
01:47:05,503 --> 01:47:07,712
You're not gonna kill me?

1235
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:14,177
- Do you understand these rights?
- You're not gonna kill me?

1236
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:21,392
If you don't go through with this,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

1237
01:47:21,477 --> 01:47:25,355
You're supposed to kill me.
He said you would.

1238
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:29,818
He? Who's he?

1239
01:47:29,902 --> 01:47:33,154
I don't know. He called me in my cell.

1240
01:47:33,239 --> 01:47:35,323
He told me I'd be released if I went along,

1241
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:40,578
- and my family would be taken care of.
- If you did what? if you did what?

1242
01:47:42,248 --> 01:47:45,750
If I acted like I killed your kid. Okay?

1243
01:47:47,503 --> 01:47:49,712
If you killed my kid?

1244
01:47:49,797 --> 01:47:53,550
Look, you don't kill me,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

1245
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:56,511
What about the pictures?

1246
01:47:57,221 --> 01:48:00,932
They're fake. He gave them to me. Okay?

1247
01:48:01,559 --> 01:48:04,144
Now, listen to me. You...

1248
01:48:04,228 --> 01:48:07,689
You tell me, who was it that set this up?

1249
01:48:08,566 --> 01:48:10,275
I don't know.

1250
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:13,069
- Come on.
- I'm asking you again.

1251
01:48:13,154 --> 01:48:16,197
- Who was it that put you up to this?
- I didn't see his face.

1252
01:48:16,282 --> 01:48:18,324
I tell you who it was,
and my family gets nothing.

1253
01:48:18,409 --> 01:48:20,451
- Who made you do this?
- Kill me.

1254
01:48:20,536 --> 01:48:22,016
- You can do this. Kill me.
- Tell me.

1255
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:24,080
- Kill me. Kill me.
- Give me the gun.

1256
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:26,583
Leo, let go of the gun.

1257
01:48:26,667 --> 01:48:29,252
Let go of the gun. It's okay.

1258
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:34,757
Let go of the gun. That's it.
Let go of the gun.

1259
01:48:36,594 --> 01:48:38,636
You're not gonna kill me.

1260
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:41,472
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait a...

1261
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:48,646
No!

1262
01:48:55,613 --> 01:48:58,072
- Hey, did you see it?
- Stay back!

1263
01:48:58,157 --> 01:49:00,325
What's happening down there?

1264
01:49:01,493 --> 01:49:03,036
Murder!

1265
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,871
Murder!

1266
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:08,666
It doesn't make sense.

1267
01:49:08,751 --> 01:49:10,919
If you were a child killer,
you took these pictures,

1268
01:49:11,003 --> 01:49:12,943
would you leave them on the bed
for anyone to find?

1269
01:49:12,963 --> 01:49:15,279
They may have been put away.
Anderton might have found them.

1270
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:18,099
- What kind of cop were you before this?
- Treasury agent. Eight years.

1271
01:49:18,135 --> 01:49:19,575
This would be
your first actual murder scene?

1272
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:20,595
Yeah.

1273
01:49:20,638 --> 01:49:22,238
I worked homicide before I went federal.

1274
01:49:22,306 --> 01:49:24,766
This is what we call an orgy of evidence.

1275
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:27,143
Know how many orgies I had
as a homicide cop, Gordon?

1276
01:49:27,228 --> 01:49:29,854
- How many?
- None.

1277
01:49:35,527 --> 01:49:37,487
This was all arranged.

1278
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:41,449
Today we saw the first murder in
the six years of the Precrime experiment.

1279
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:45,495
Sadly enough, this failure was human.

1280
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:49,082
The protection team simply didn't
get there in time to stop the murder.

1281
01:49:49,166 --> 01:49:54,295
But the murder itself happened exactly
as the Precogs predicted it would.

1282
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:58,132
I think that today's event put
a human face on the Precrime system.

1283
01:49:58,217 --> 01:50:02,262
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.

1284
01:50:05,057 --> 01:50:06,724
Lamar?

1285
01:50:14,108 --> 01:50:15,172
- What?
- Lamar, there's something

1286
01:50:15,192 --> 01:50:17,443
terribly wrong.
We're chasing the wrong man.

1287
01:50:17,528 --> 01:50:18,569
What?

1288
01:50:18,654 --> 01:50:20,238
I don't wanna say over the phone.

1289
01:50:20,322 --> 01:50:22,073
Meet me at Anderton's.

1290
01:50:22,366 --> 01:50:25,535
We recovered that
from Leo Crow's hotel room.

1291
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:34,877
I remember when I gave this
to him, back in Baltimore.

1292
01:50:35,963 --> 01:50:37,547
Please, sir.

1293
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:42,427
Tell me what you have.

1294
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:50,101
This is the murder of a woman
named Anne Lively.

1295
01:50:51,937 --> 01:50:55,982
Yeah, John told me about this.
You got this from Containment?

1296
01:50:56,066 --> 01:50:58,985
Yes. this is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.

1297
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:01,070
Agatha's stream was missing.

1298
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:05,450
Now this one is from the cyber parlor.

1299
01:51:05,534 --> 01:51:10,079
Anderton downloaded this directly from
Agatha, and Rufus Riley recorded it.

1300
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:16,836
- It's the same prevision.
- Not quite.

1301
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:23,092
Look at the surface wind
across the water. Watch the ripples.

1302
01:51:23,844 --> 01:51:26,429
Moving away from shore.

1303
01:51:27,973 --> 01:51:29,307
Now the second image.

1304
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:32,477
This is the one from Containment.
It's what Art and Dash saw.

1305
01:51:33,145 --> 01:51:34,854
Watch the water.

1306
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:40,651
The wind's changed.
The ripples are moving the other way.

1307
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:45,948
This murder's taking place
at two different times.

1308
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:48,159
According to the Sentry,
Anderton was watching this

1309
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:49,923
at Containment right before he was tagged.

1310
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:53,039
Well, I know. He came to me,
told me about the missing data stream.

1311
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:54,999
He was concerned that you might find it.

1312
01:51:55,084 --> 01:51:58,961
Well, he was right. I did find it.
It was inside of Agatha the whole time.

1313
01:51:59,046 --> 01:52:03,633
So the question is, why would someone
want this erased from the data file?

1314
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:07,970
Danny, just tell me what you're thinking.

1315
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:11,808
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.

1316
01:52:12,434 --> 01:52:13,476
How?

1317
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:16,270
Well, Jad told me
that sometimes the Precogs see

1318
01:52:16,355 --> 01:52:17,897
the same murder more than once.

1319
01:52:18,315 --> 01:52:22,568
- It's called an echo.
- Jad called it "Precog déjà vu."

1320
01:52:22,653 --> 01:52:26,614
Well, we teach the techs
to identify them and disregard.

1321
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:32,453
Yeah, but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo?

1322
01:52:32,538 --> 01:52:33,977
What if what he was really looking at

1323
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:36,749
was a completely
different murder altogether?

1324
01:52:36,834 --> 01:52:39,168
I don't understand.

1325
01:52:39,253 --> 01:52:41,671
All you'd have to do is
hire someone to kill Anne Lively,

1326
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,258
someone like a drifter, a neuroin addict,
someone with nothing to lose.

1327
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:47,969
Precrime stops the murder
from taking place,

1328
01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:53,683
haloes the killer, takes him away.
But then, right then, someone else,

1329
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:57,103
having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same clothes,

1330
01:52:57,187 --> 01:53:00,690
commits the murder in exactly the same way.

1331
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:06,487
Technician takes a look,
thinks he's looking at an echo, erases it.

1332
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:13,222
Of course, it would have to be someone

1333
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:16,122
with access to the previsions
in the first place.

1334
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:17,498
Someone fairly high up.

1335
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:22,837
Do you know what I hear?

1336
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:28,384
Nothing. No footsteps up the stairs.

1337
01:53:28,469 --> 01:53:32,180
No hovercraft out the window.
No clickety-click of little spyders.

1338
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:34,204
Do you know why I can't hear
any of those things, Danny?

1339
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:37,727
Because right now,
the Precogs can't see a thing.

1340
01:54:02,628 --> 01:54:05,254
Can you see? It's beautiful.

1341
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:09,425
- Where are we going?
- Some place safe.

1342
01:54:17,142 --> 01:54:19,101
- Burgess.
- Lamar, it's Lara.

1343
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:21,646
- Yes, Lara.
- You have to help him.

1344
01:54:23,148 --> 01:54:25,691
- Is he there?
- Yes.

1345
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:28,861
Has he got the Precog with him?

1346
01:54:31,073 --> 01:54:34,617
- Yes.
- Keep them there. I'm on my way.

1347
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:38,746
Please. Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
I don't trust him.

1348
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:41,958
I won't say a word.

1349
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:47,129
You just don't let John leave, all right?

1350
01:54:48,465 --> 01:54:50,174
He's no killer, Lamar.

1351
01:54:50,801 --> 01:54:52,385
I know.

1352
01:55:03,772 --> 01:55:05,273
It's cold.

1353
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:12,905
Lara, this is Agatha.

1354
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:23,332
You remember when I would read
Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?

1355
01:55:26,503 --> 01:55:31,340
He got so scared when Tom and Becky
were lost in the cave.

1356
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:36,220
I gotta sit down.

1357
01:55:37,556 --> 01:55:42,518
I gotta figure this out.

1358
01:56:21,975 --> 01:56:23,559
They used Sean.

1359
01:56:25,604 --> 01:56:28,230
They wanted me to think Crow killed him.

1360
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:31,067
But he didn't.

1361
01:56:32,736 --> 01:56:34,195
He didn't.

1362
01:56:36,114 --> 01:56:38,407
Why would they set you up?

1363
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:48,626
Because I found out about her.

1364
01:56:49,753 --> 01:56:51,837
About who?

1365
01:56:51,922 --> 01:56:55,633
- How could I not have seen this?
- Seen what?

1366
01:56:56,927 --> 01:56:58,761
Anne Lively.

1367
01:57:01,473 --> 01:57:02,932
Agatha.

1368
01:57:07,729 --> 01:57:12,358
Dr. Hineman once said, "The dead
don't die. They look on and help."

1369
01:57:13,819 --> 01:57:15,611
Remember that, John.

1370
01:57:17,114 --> 01:57:19,281
- Agatha.
- Sean.

1371
01:57:24,204 --> 01:57:28,749
He's on the beach now, toe in the water.

1372
01:57:30,585 --> 01:57:33,295
He's asking you to come in with him.

1373
01:57:34,339 --> 01:57:37,717
He's been racing his mother
up and down the sand.

1374
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:42,012
There's so much love in this house.

1375
01:57:47,227 --> 01:57:49,145
He's 10 years old.

1376
01:57:51,606 --> 01:57:53,816
He's surrounded by animals.

1377
01:57:55,485 --> 01:57:57,528
He wants to be a vet.

1378
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:03,993
You keep a rabbit for him,
a bird and a fox.

1379
01:58:05,912 --> 01:58:07,705
He's in high school.

1380
01:58:08,165 --> 01:58:11,000
He likes to run, like his father.

1381
01:58:11,543 --> 01:58:14,670
He runs the two-mile and the long relay.

1382
01:58:16,256 --> 01:58:18,007
He's 23.

1383
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:21,343
He's at a university.

1384
01:58:22,053 --> 01:58:25,181
He makes love
to a pretty girl named Claire.

1385
01:58:25,265 --> 01:58:27,725
He asks her to be his wife.

1386
01:58:28,518 --> 01:58:31,520
He calls here and tells Lara, who cries.

1387
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:39,195
He still runs across the university and
in the stadium, where John watches.

1388
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:44,200
Oh, God.
He's running so fast, just like his daddy.

1389
01:58:45,535 --> 01:58:49,038
He sees his daddy. He wants to run to him.

1390
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:55,169
But he's only six years old,
and he can't do it.

1391
01:58:56,004 --> 01:58:58,380
And the other man is so fast.

1392
01:59:02,594 --> 01:59:05,262
There was so much love in this house.

1393
01:59:06,431 --> 01:59:08,557
I want him back so bad.

1394
01:59:11,269 --> 01:59:13,020
So did she.

1395
01:59:13,855 --> 01:59:15,523
Can't you see?

1396
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:21,946
She just wanted her little girl back.

1397
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:26,700
But it was too late.

1398
01:59:28,662 --> 01:59:31,080
Her little girl was already gone.

1399
01:59:31,832 --> 01:59:33,582
She's still alive.

1400
01:59:35,085 --> 01:59:39,004
She didn't die, but she's not alive.

1401
01:59:41,132 --> 01:59:42,633
Agatha?

1402
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:48,389
Just tell me, who killed your mother?

1403
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:51,976
Who killed Anne Lively?

1404
01:59:53,728 --> 01:59:58,607
I'm sorry, John,
but you're gonna have to run again.

1405
01:59:59,442 --> 02:00:00,484
What?

1406
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:03,612
Run!

1407
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:20,004
I love you.

1408
02:00:20,797 --> 02:00:22,631
- Okay. You're okay.
- No, no.

1409
02:00:22,716 --> 02:00:25,551
- You'll be fine with them.
- No, no.

1410
02:00:25,635 --> 02:00:26,886
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1411
02:00:26,970 --> 02:00:29,054
- John, no.
- Don't talk.

1412
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,532
John Anderton.

1413
02:00:49,826 --> 02:00:52,703
By mandate of the
District of Columbia Precrime Division,

1414
02:00:52,787 --> 02:00:57,875
I'm placing you under arrest for the
murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.

1415
02:01:01,171 --> 02:01:02,588
That's it.

1416
02:01:03,173 --> 02:01:04,840
That's my girl.

1417
02:01:07,010 --> 02:01:09,511
I was so worried about you.

1418
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:14,767
Did he hurt you?

1419
02:01:18,188 --> 02:01:20,064
I missed you so much.

1420
02:01:20,148 --> 02:01:23,984
It's okay. Wally's here. Wally's here.

1421
02:01:29,366 --> 02:01:33,911
You're a part of my flock now, John.
Welcome.

1422
02:01:35,372 --> 02:01:39,959
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions,

1423
02:01:40,043 --> 02:01:46,256
that your life flashes before your eyes,
that all your dreams come true.

1424
02:02:03,608 --> 02:02:05,609
This is all my fault.

1425
02:02:06,945 --> 02:02:09,446
There was nothing anyone could do.

1426
02:02:12,033 --> 02:02:13,409
Lara...

1427
02:02:14,035 --> 02:02:16,787
I thought you might want to have those.

1428
02:02:23,003 --> 02:02:27,464
I haven't worn this in years. I just wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight.

1429
02:02:27,549 --> 02:02:29,216
You look great.

1430
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:33,470
I knew he was having trouble for some
time, and yet I did nothing about it.

1431
02:02:33,555 --> 02:02:36,181
Excuse me. The guy from USA today is here.

1432
02:02:36,266 --> 02:02:37,307
Tell him not now.

1433
02:02:37,392 --> 02:02:40,602
- He just wanted a few minutes before...
- Not now!

1434
02:02:43,398 --> 02:02:47,067
- I thought you were retiring.
- Well, I was.

1435
02:02:47,152 --> 02:02:52,114
But this incident with John
made me realize the fragility of all this.

1436
02:02:53,491 --> 02:02:56,785
This is John's legacy
as much as it is my own.

1437
02:02:57,620 --> 02:03:00,956
Now I have an obligation to protect that.

1438
02:03:01,583 --> 02:03:05,335
Lara, I know how difficult this is for you.

1439
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:09,923
But maybe you can find
some closure in the fact that

1440
02:03:10,008 --> 02:03:12,926
John finally found the man
who killed your son.

1441
02:03:16,306 --> 02:03:18,057
Who's Anne Lively?

1442
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:22,770
- Who?
- Anne Lively.

1443
02:03:23,563 --> 02:03:27,066
John was talking about her
right before they took him.

1444
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:29,151
I don't know who that is.

1445
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:35,908
John said something about him being
set up because he found out about her.

1446
02:03:35,992 --> 02:03:41,080
- Well, we know why John was tagged.
- He also said Crow was a fake.

1447
02:03:41,164 --> 02:03:43,916
And Witwer? He was killed with John's gun

1448
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,585
- inside John's apartment.
- Lamar, do you know the reason

1449
02:03:46,669 --> 02:03:50,047
why John came here to work for you?

1450
02:03:50,131 --> 02:03:51,590
- Sean.
- Yes.

1451
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:55,761
He came here to work for you
because he thought

1452
02:03:55,845 --> 02:04:00,516
if he could just stop
that kind of thing from happening...

1453
02:04:01,226 --> 02:04:04,394
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

1454
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:09,024
Sir, they wanna start
the press conference in two minutes.

1455
02:04:09,442 --> 02:04:13,737
Lara, John was the best cop I ever knew,

1456
02:04:13,822 --> 02:04:17,116
and, in some ways, also the best man.

1457
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,785
But the scars he carried around...

1458
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:25,415
Well, I know he'd want us to honor the
good things we remember about him.

1459
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:28,293
And I also know why he married you.

1460
02:04:28,378 --> 02:04:30,712
You're as stubborn as he is.

1461
02:04:31,297 --> 02:04:32,297
Lamar...

1462
02:04:32,382 --> 02:04:35,634
Lara, do you know how to tie one of these?

1463
02:04:35,718 --> 02:04:39,721
Could you please give me a hand?
I'm all thumbs, you see.

1464
02:04:48,064 --> 02:04:50,983
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1465
02:04:51,067 --> 02:04:55,487
First thing Monday,
I'll look over the Witwer evidence.

1466
02:04:55,572 --> 02:04:59,366
And I'll have Gideon
run the Containment files,

1467
02:04:59,450 --> 02:05:02,494
see if anyone drowned a woman
by the name of...

1468
02:05:02,579 --> 02:05:04,872
What did you say her name was?

1469
02:05:07,417 --> 02:05:09,168
Anne Lively.

1470
02:05:09,752 --> 02:05:12,171
But I never said she drowned.

1471
02:05:32,150 --> 02:05:36,612
- Sir, the press conference is starting.
- I'll be right there.

1472
02:05:41,701 --> 02:05:43,952
We'll talk about this later.

1473
02:05:44,829 --> 02:05:48,832
Perhaps tomorrow I'll come by the cottage.

1474
02:06:26,162 --> 02:06:28,538
I'd like a word with my husband.

1475
02:06:29,499 --> 02:06:31,833
You're not authorized.

1476
02:06:32,627 --> 02:06:34,836
How did you get in here?

1477
02:06:44,264 --> 02:06:45,430
Thank you.

1478
02:06:45,515 --> 02:06:50,519
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess,
director of the new National Precrime.

1479
02:06:53,856 --> 02:06:57,192
On behalf of your staff,
we would like to present you with this.

1480
02:06:57,277 --> 02:07:00,696
- Congratulations, sir.
- My God.

1481
02:07:02,407 --> 02:07:03,782
How did you get this?

1482
02:07:03,866 --> 02:07:05,909
I padded your expense account
for six months.

1483
02:07:09,747 --> 02:07:11,456
Revolvers like this one

1484
02:07:11,874 --> 02:07:16,169
were given to generals at the end of
the Civil War by their troops.

1485
02:07:17,171 --> 02:07:21,133
The cylinders were loaded
with five gold-plated bullets

1486
02:07:21,217 --> 02:07:24,052
to symbolize the end
of the destruction and death

1487
02:07:24,137 --> 02:07:27,139
that had ripped the country apart
for five years.

1488
02:07:27,223 --> 02:07:30,934
Ladies and gentlemen,
with Precrime going national,

1489
02:07:31,019 --> 02:07:34,813
maybe we can all look forward
to a time when none of us

1490
02:07:34,897 --> 02:07:38,317
will have to discharge
another firearm ever again.

1491
02:07:39,902 --> 02:07:44,072
Now enjoy yourselves.
Enjoy yourselves! That's an order.

1492
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:50,787
Does this mean we can finally use
the lake house on weekends?

1493
02:07:50,872 --> 02:07:52,164
I hope so.

1494
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:57,336
Hello. Yes. Right away.

1495
02:07:58,796 --> 02:08:01,131
Excuse me. Excuse me. So sorry.

1496
02:08:02,133 --> 02:08:03,842
- Sir?
- Yes.

1497
02:08:03,926 --> 02:08:05,908
Sir, you have an emergency call
on your private line.

1498
02:08:05,928 --> 02:08:07,763
All right. Thank you.

1499
02:08:08,431 --> 02:08:10,349
Yes, this is Burgess.

1500
02:08:10,433 --> 02:08:14,311
Hello, Lamar. I just wanted
to congratulate you. You did it.

1501
02:08:15,188 --> 02:08:17,773
You created a world without murder.

1502
02:08:17,857 --> 02:08:20,984
Sir, everyone wants your name on a hat.
Can you sign these for us?

1503
02:08:21,069 --> 02:08:23,612
And all you had to do
was kill someone to do it.

1504
02:08:28,284 --> 02:08:29,284
A-room. Jad.

1505
02:08:30,286 --> 02:08:33,538
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.

1506
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:35,146
I don't know what you're talking about.

1507
02:08:35,166 --> 02:08:38,794
I'm talking about Agatha's mother,
Anne Lively.

1508
02:08:38,878 --> 02:08:41,546
Just a junkie who had a kid once
and had to give her up.

1509
02:08:41,631 --> 02:08:45,926
But surprise. She cleaned herself up
and she wanted her daughter back.

1510
02:08:46,010 --> 02:08:47,677
She wanted Agatha.

1511
02:08:50,932 --> 02:08:52,224
Jad, you getting this?

1512
02:08:52,308 --> 02:08:55,148
It's a single stream from the female only
with no time or incident data.

1513
02:08:55,269 --> 02:08:57,771
Whatever this is, it isn't the future.
It already happened.

1514
02:08:57,980 --> 02:09:01,566
The problem was, without
Agatha, there was no Precrime.

1515
02:09:01,651 --> 02:09:04,111
She's always been
the strongest of the three.

1516
02:09:04,195 --> 02:09:06,405
You knew without Agatha, you had nothing.

1517
02:09:06,489 --> 02:09:08,490
Without her,
you wouldn't be where you are now,

1518
02:09:08,574 --> 02:09:11,201
standing there, signing autographs.

1519
02:09:20,169 --> 02:09:21,169
Jad, what are you doing?

1520
02:09:22,046 --> 02:09:23,528
Jad. Jad, what are you doing with that?

1521
02:09:23,548 --> 02:09:24,756
What you up to, big man?

1522
02:09:24,841 --> 02:09:27,259
Jad, Jad, let's think before you send that.

1523
02:09:27,343 --> 02:09:28,343
Slow down.

1524
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:52,284
So now you had to get rid of
Anne Lively. You had to shut her up,

1525
02:09:52,368 --> 02:09:53,910
which presented a problem.

1526
02:09:53,995 --> 02:09:57,622
How can you kill her
without the Precogs seeing it?

1527
02:09:57,707 --> 02:10:02,127
Simple.
Use a system you control against her.

1528
02:10:02,211 --> 02:10:04,212
So you hired someone to kill her for you,

1529
02:10:04,297 --> 02:10:07,507
knowing full well
the Precogs would see that murder.

1530
02:10:07,592 --> 02:10:10,927
You lured Anne Lively out to the lake

1531
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:14,890
with the promise
of reuniting her with her daughter.

1532
02:10:59,769 --> 02:11:01,728
Where's my daughter?

1533
02:11:09,028 --> 02:11:10,237
Where?

1534
02:11:12,406 --> 02:11:13,657
Run.

1535
02:11:16,994 --> 02:11:18,119
Run!

1536
02:11:29,966 --> 02:11:33,301
And then, when you were
all alone, you killed her yourself,

1537
02:11:33,386 --> 02:11:37,222
in the same way the Precogs predicted
your John Doe would kill her.

1538
02:11:37,306 --> 02:11:40,058
You made the real murder look like an echo,

1539
02:11:40,142 --> 02:11:44,646
knowing the tech would do
what he was trained to do. Disregard it.

1540
02:11:51,070 --> 02:11:54,990
Anne Lively became
just another missing person.

1541
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:58,702
So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?

1542
02:12:00,079 --> 02:12:02,080
What are you gonna do?

1543
02:12:13,342 --> 02:12:15,093
We got a Red Ball!

1544
02:12:20,850 --> 02:12:26,271
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

1545
02:12:26,355 --> 02:12:31,443
Think about all the lives she will save.
That little girl could have saved Sean.

1546
02:12:31,527 --> 02:12:34,029
Don't you ever say his name!

1547
02:12:36,532 --> 02:12:39,534
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

1548
02:12:39,744 --> 02:12:42,787
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up!

1549
02:12:42,872 --> 02:12:45,790
That was the one thing you knew
that would drive me to murder.

1550
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:49,377
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?

1551
02:12:49,712 --> 02:12:51,504
- How are you gonna...
- Shut me up?

1552
02:12:51,714 --> 02:12:53,757
Forgive me, John.

1553
02:13:02,433 --> 02:13:04,100
Forgive me, John.

1554
02:13:15,821 --> 02:13:18,406
Lamar, it's over.

1555
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:24,871
The question you have to ask is,
what are you gonna do now?

1556
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:40,637
No doubt the Precogs
have already seen this.

1557
02:13:41,138 --> 02:13:42,681
No doubt.

1558
02:13:44,183 --> 02:13:46,351
You see the dilemma, don't you?

1559
02:13:47,103 --> 02:13:51,314
If you don't kill me, Precogs were
wrong and Precrime is over.

1560
02:13:52,441 --> 02:13:56,319
If you do kill me, you go away,

1561
02:13:56,404 --> 02:14:00,323
but it proves the system works.
Precogs were right.

1562
02:14:07,206 --> 02:14:10,041
So, what are you gonna do now?

1563
02:14:11,836 --> 02:14:13,628
What's it worth?

1564
02:14:14,505 --> 02:14:16,339
Just one more murder.

1565
02:14:19,927 --> 02:14:24,556
You'll rot in hell with a halo,
but people will still believe in Precrime.

1566
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:28,309
All you have to do is kill me,
like they said you would.

1567
02:14:32,481 --> 02:14:37,402
Except you know your own future,

1568
02:14:37,486 --> 02:14:40,905
which means you can change it
if you want to.

1569
02:14:42,199 --> 02:14:46,619
You still have a choice, Lamar, like I did.

1570
02:14:52,209 --> 02:14:54,794
Yes, I have a choice.

1571
02:14:56,297 --> 02:14:57,922
And I made it.

1572
02:14:59,216 --> 02:15:00,884
Forgive me, John.

1573
02:15:02,845 --> 02:15:04,304
Forgive me.

1574
02:15:09,935 --> 02:15:11,686
Forgive me, my boy.

1575
02:15:30,206 --> 02:15:31,539
Lamar!

1576
02:15:43,052 --> 02:15:47,597
In 2054,the six-year Precrime
experiment was abandoned.

1577
02:15:55,564 --> 02:15:58,650
ALL prisoners were unconditionally
pardoned and released,

1578
02:15:58,734 --> 02:16:03,196
although police departments kept watch
on many of them for years to come.

1579
02:16:50,953 --> 02:16:56,040
Agatha and the twins were transferred
to an undisclosed location,

1580
02:16:57,960 --> 02:17:01,546
a place where they could find relief
from their gifts.

1581
02:17:01,630 --> 02:17:05,258
A place where they could
live out their lives in peace.
