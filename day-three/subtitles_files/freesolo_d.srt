00:01:23,097 --> 00:01:27,502
Our next guest is a free soloing
phenomenon, please welcome Alex Honnold.

3
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:34,306
Here is what I
don't understand.

4
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:38,513
One little mistake, one little
slip, and you fall and die.

5
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,315
Yeah, I mean, uh, you
seem to understand it well...

6
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:45,954
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

7
00:01:46,787 --> 00:01:50,491
And I feel like anybody could
conceivably die on any given day.

8
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:56,097
Soloing makes it feel far more
immediate and much more present.

9
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:02,204
Does it feel different
to be up there without a rope?

10
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:05,303
When you're climbing without
a rope, it's obviously like

11
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:08,007
much higher consequence, much,
much higher level of focus.

12
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,246
You know, it's a whole
different experience.

13
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:15,246
So it's not like I'm just
pushing and pushing and pushing

14
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:17,149
until something
terrible happens.

15
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:20,055
I don't look at it, like,
with that perspective.

16
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:24,222
But maybe that's why
it's dangerous for me.

17
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:28,362
Maybe I'm too close to it and I can't
tell that I'm speeding towards a cliff.

18
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:47,314
Okay.

19
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,692
I like to differentiate
between risk and consequence.

20
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:03,728
You know, when I'm doing these hard free
solos I like to think that the risk,

21
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,496
you know, the chance
of me falling off is

22
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:07,733
quite low even though the
consequence is extremely high.

23
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:10,269
And that's kind of like one of the
appeals of free soloing, you know,

24
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:13,975
to take something that seems difficult
and dangerous and make it feel safe.

25
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:18,243
So, do you think that, uh, being a rock
climber has been a positive or negative

26
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:20,044
for your dating life?

27
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:21,412
My dating life?

28
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:22,548
Yeah.

29
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,417
I think, uh, I think
overall it's been a negative.

30
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:28,422
Um, I just travel too
much and I live in a car.

31
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:38,165
Let's talk through some of
the climbing adventures you've had.

32
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:41,233
The historic free solo
climb, Moonlight Buttress.

33
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:44,335
When I did it, it was like,
"Oh," you know, kind of groundbreaking,

34
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:46,371
kind of extreme.

35
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:49,677
But for me it always felt
quite easy and pretty secure.

36
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,211
Well, that wasn't where you
stopped, because that next challenge then

37
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:55,416
was free soloing Half Dome.

38
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:59,785
Half Dome was a huge step for me
because it was twice as big as anything

39
00:03:59,787 --> 00:04:02,022
I'd ever soloed.

40
00:04:02,922 --> 00:04:06,458
<i>Free soloing is so
dangerous that less than 1% of people</i>

41
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,462
<i>who climb attempt it.</i>

42
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:13,501
<i>Alex has done more than 1,000 free solo
climbs, but none were tougher than this one.</i>

43
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:19,341
I got quite scared in some places,
and then you start to panic a little bit.

44
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:22,710
And then you have to,
like, reel it all back in.

45
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:28,116
What is next in
free solo climbing?

46
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:30,582
Well, I don't know, I mean,
I've thought about El Cap, like,

47
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,583
for years and every
year I look at it and I'm like,

48
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:34,186
"That's really scary."

49
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:37,388
Um, well, I've never even wanted to
really, or I've always wanted to but then

50
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,194
I've always been like,
"That's too scary."

51
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,669
I'm aiming towards the most
beautiful valley on earth.

52
00:04:48,503 --> 00:04:52,203
I remember coming to Yosemite as a little
kid and my dad would always have a little

53
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:55,073
cooler in the back of the car, and
have our cookies in the cold milk,

54
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:58,410
and we'd sit on these slabs above
Tunnel View, which is, like,

55
00:04:58,412 --> 00:05:01,248
the most epic
view of Yosemite.

56
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:05,619
As soon as you see El Cap it's like,
"Oh, there it is, pretty exciting."

57
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:12,794
El Cap is the most
impressive wall on earth.

58
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:58,136
Yeah, I mean I love,
I love being in the van.

59
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:00,605
I probably feel extra comfortable
in the van now because I've lived

60
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:03,174
in it for nine years.

61
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:06,511
My first van, well, I actually
stole the family minivan.

62
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:09,814
My dad died when I was
19 and I, I quit school.

63
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,316
There was some life insurance.

64
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:15,253
I had just enough to dirt bag.

65
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:18,924
Six years ago I was living in a Walmart
parking lot and spending eighty-eight cents

66
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:21,863
on dinner every night.

67
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:25,196
Living in a van is great but, you know,
at a certain point it'd be nice to have a

68
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:28,735
bathroom and have,
like, a shower at least.

69
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,275
So you have a
girlfriend now, I heard.

70
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,544
- Hmm, trending towards one.
- Trending towards?

71
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:44,318
Hmm, I mean, she's very supportive
about, like, you know, you have to do you.

72
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:46,318
Yeah we'll, we'll see.

73
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,922
But yeah, there probably will be
plenty of girlfriends in my life,

74
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:52,457
you know, in terms of,
like, big climbing,

75
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:55,893
lifetime achievement deals,
where you're just like, well,

76
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:59,698
like I will always choose
climbing, over, over a lady.

77
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,902
At least, you know, so far.

78
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:06,905
How many times have
you climbed El Cap?

79
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:08,407
Probably like 40
something maybe.

80
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:13,544
- You ever free solo? -No and nobody has.
- Why haven't you done it yet?

81
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:16,885
Um, look at it, like, I mean, you know,
think about it, it's freaking scary.

82
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:21,919
I don't know, so I mean I've thought about
this since 2009, like, each year since 2009,

83
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:24,489
I've been like, "This is the year,"
and each year I climb it and I'm like,

84
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:27,258
"This isn't the year, like,
this is fucked," you know.

85
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,761
So I'm like, "Uh." But the
thing is I'll never be content,

86
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,328
unless I at least
put in the effort.

87
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,965
Because, like, if I do all the work and
I'm still like, "This is messed up,"

88
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:37,568
then maybe it's just not for me,
maybe its future generation, you know.

89
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,707
Or maybe just somebody who
has nothing to live for.

90
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:54,721
When I thought about El Cap years ago, there
were question marks all over the walls.

91
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:57,855
It's like I don't know about this
pitch, I don't know about that pitch,

92
00:07:57,857 --> 00:08:00,491
like I don't know about this particular
slab, there are all these things that

93
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:03,695
seem pretty crazy to me.

94
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:09,635
If the ultimate dream is to solo El Cap,
then I need a good map of what that will

95
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:14,739
take, you know, like a, a mental image of
what the hard parts are, where they are,

96
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:17,645
what they will entail.

97
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:21,549
If I'm going to do it, Free
Rider seems like the best route.

98
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:27,953
Oh, hi.

99
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,821
What's up, dude?

100
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:31,789
Oh, hey.

101
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,729
Oh, actually, I might as well just
rack it straight onto my harness.

102
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:36,929
So, do you wanna lead
the Freeblast or do I?

103
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:41,065
I feel like we should do what we did
before which would be you lead the, yeah,

104
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,367
you lead the Freeblast.

105
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:45,469
So, basically I'll just try
to take it, like, as far as I can.

106
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,474
Yeah.

107
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:54,846
So Tommy just got here
and they're going up Freerider.

108
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,247
Okay.

109
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:59,483
I'm just gonna try to shoot this
pitch and the traverse pitch and then

110
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:01,588
I'm gonna jug out
like a maniac.

111
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:02,953
Okay.

112
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:04,789
Do we have enough line
up there to do all this?

113
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,027
- Yeah.
- Okay.

114
00:09:15,868 --> 00:09:18,403
The idea of going up
on El Cap with Tommy Caldwell

115
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:21,309
is to get a feel for the
route and just visualize it.

116
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,076
To see what feels
scary and what doesn't.

117
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:26,111
Oh, God.

118
00:09:26,113 --> 00:09:29,714
Look at those fixed ropes
the first climb.

119
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:35,687
Tommy's been a hero
of mine since I was a kid.

120
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:37,988
I didn't technically have posters
of him up in my room as a kid,

121
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,894
but it was like the same deal, you know,
where I was like, "Tommy's the man."

122
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,368
Tommy really showed what was
possible, free climbing on El Cap.

123
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:51,502
Tommy is the one that explored
every aspect of the wall.

124
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:54,805
And most of the routes that he's put up on El
Cap haven't been repeated because they're,

125
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:57,477
they're basically too hard.

126
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:01,512
And then, ultimately culminated
with the Dawn Wall which was his

127
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:03,647
multi-year project.

128
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,820
I mean possibly the hardest
big wall in the world.

129
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,567
I've been obsessed
with El Cap for years.

130
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:25,572
El Capitan is unbelievably
huge, kind of unfathomably huge.

131
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:30,541
It's 3,200 feet
of sheer granite.

132
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:32,711
Looking at it, it doesn't seem
right, it doesn't seem like you

133
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:36,117
should be able to climb it.

134
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:39,785
I understand why
Alex is obsessed.

135
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:42,923
El Cap has obsessed
generations of climbers.

136
00:10:43,157 --> 00:10:48,193
I think it was first climbed in 1958 by
Warren Harding, and it took them 46 days

137
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:51,465
over 16 months because they
couldn't do it continuously.

138
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:59,940
They had to drill bolts into the
granite and pull themselves up.

139
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:04,512
And then ever since then, it's been the
center of the rock climbing universe.

140
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:12,987
I've spent 20 years of my life climbing
El Cap but I'd never do it without a rope.

141
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:16,823
There's no margin for error.

142
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:23,130
Imagine an Olympic gold medal level athletic
achievement, that if you don't get that

143
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,865
gold medal you're gonna die.

144
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:30,168
That's pretty much what
free soloing El Cap is like.

145
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,708
You have to do it perfectly.

146
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:40,945
Today I am playing through
a lot of different scenarios,

147
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:44,050
so thinking about the moves,
thinking about the body position,

148
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:48,620
and more than anything just thinking
about what it would feel like to,

149
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:51,793
to be in that position
without a rope.

150
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:55,626
There are a lot of things that
you can physically do on a rope.

151
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:56,962
Oh, God.

152
00:11:56,964 --> 00:11:59,164
But then the idea of taking the
rope away, you're just like,

153
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,765
"I don't know if I'd wanna trust
that little foothold. Oh, my God,

154
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:05,937
my feet hurt so bad and I'm
so pumped and my hand hurts.

155
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:07,606
I just feel pooped.

156
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:10,210
We're kind of getting worked.

157
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:14,145
When you've been thinking about something
for years, that's a long time to be,

158
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:18,085
like, sort of considering an idea without,
like, really talking to anybody about it.

159
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:21,756
Especially someone like Tommy.

160
00:12:22,322 --> 00:12:25,089
When I was climbing, like, up the
endurance corner and across the traverse,

161
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:28,526
I was just looking down thinking about,
I was like, "Dude, this seems so scary."

162
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:29,661
I don't know.

163
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:31,262
That part is just
so exposed and it's pretty.

164
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:33,298
See, that part again is like, at
least you have holds though, you know.

165
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,632
Yeah.

166
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:37,836
The Freeblast slabs have
like several moves where it's like,

167
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:40,271
your whole life just depends
on one foothold, you know.

168
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:43,208
Soloing is like such a
weird personal activity.

169
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,142
You never talk about
soloing projects.

170
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:48,813
I mean, I've done all my
soloing without telling anybody,

171
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:52,918
because I don't want
any extra pressure.

172
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,187
The idea of climbing El Cap, obviously I
get interview questions about it all the

173
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:57,923
time, like, "Oh, would
you like to do that?"

174
00:12:57,925 --> 00:12:59,024
And I've always been like,

175
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:01,126
"No, well maybe, we'll see.
You know, who knows?"

176
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:04,165
But like in the back of your mind
you're like, "Yes, for sure."

177
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:16,073
I used to be like
a super picky eater.

178
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:21,516
When I was like 19 or 20 or, well, between like,
20 and 24, I basically decided that I had

179
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:25,083
to start eating vegetables, and then
sort of, like, systematically introduced

180
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:29,257
myself to vegetables, like one at
a time, which worked pretty well,

181
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:32,826
now I pretty much
eat anything.

182
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:40,966
I stopped eating meat maybe
three or four years ago, um,

183
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:43,068
mostly for
environmental reasons.

184
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,641
Then once I stopped I also kind of got
into the ethics of it a little bit more.

185
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:54,011
We'll just see how
this comes out.

186
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:56,615
Yeah, I mean there are plenty of folks who
probably think that this is, like, terrible.

187
00:13:56,617 --> 00:14:00,121
I'm eating, like,
canned chili and eggs.

188
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:05,222
Growing up, I mean, I didn't
like eating weird foods,

189
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:08,959
I didn't like bugs, you know,
I was just like a total tweeker.

190
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:11,831
I guess I was
quite a shy child.

191
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:14,833
Bit of a dark soul, I think.

192
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:17,571
Maybe melancholic is the word.

193
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:22,707
I remember really liking to play with
my Legos and play computer games and,

194
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:25,709
uh, and then obviously once I started
rock climbing I was going to the

195
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,645
climbing gym all the time.

196
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:31,216
But I didn't really have a whole
lot of hobbies or interests.

197
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:33,885
I definitely wasn't
cool, you know.

198
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:36,655
I grew up in Sacramento and the
high school I went to, I was, uh,

199
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:39,757
in an international baccalaureate
program, so we were all sort of

200
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,959
the intellectual kids.

201
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:45,262
So, in a way it was fine to be sort
of a dorky loner cause, you know,

202
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:48,201
the whole program was
focused around that.

203
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:52,203
There was definitely a time when I started
climbing outside more and I was just

204
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,304
starting to road trip
and go to campgrounds,

205
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:56,908
but I was too afraid
to talk to strangers.

206
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,044
So, I was doing a lot of soloing, or
just a lot of climbing by myself just

207
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:03,383
because I didn't know anybody and
I didn't wanna talk to anybody.

208
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:07,254
It's freaking good,
I've outdone myself.

209
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:13,628
Spicy chili really
adds something.

210
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,934
As a kid I just love climbing trees
and climbing buildings and, like,

211
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:24,736
playing on things.

212
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:27,308
And when I was going to school here I was also
climbing on all the roofs and stuff here.

213
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,708
Uh, and, uh, yeah.

214
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,043
It's actually kind of intimidating
talking to groups of kids.

215
00:15:32,045 --> 00:15:34,978
Like, when I was in high school
I was mortified of standing in

216
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,447
front of the class.

217
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:38,348
But, like, you kind of get through
it and, like, eventually you feel

218
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,784
more and more comfortable.

219
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:41,052
I don't know.

220
00:15:41,054 --> 00:15:42,853
- There's a question.
- Um, yeah.

221
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:45,089
How do you feel about being
famous, just for, like,

222
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:46,692
turning your hobby
into your career?

223
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:49,828
I mean, I think it's the best thing in
life to be able to take the one thing

224
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,963
you love most and have it, like, work
out that you can make a living that way.

225
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,199
You know, so it's nice that I
now get paid to do that, yeah.

226
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:57,404
How much money do you have?

227
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,176
I've got, I've got, I've got probably
like 40 bucks in my wallet, you know.

228
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:05,977
Um, but no, like,
a, a fair amount.

229
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:11,182
Um, like, like, you know, say, like,
a moderately successful dentist

230
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:13,354
or something, probably.

231
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:15,252
Mr. K?

232
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:17,988
Alex, could you talk about your
foundation a bit and what you're doing?

233
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,394
Yeah, so, I started a non-profit,
um, I guess maybe four years ago.

234
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:24,998
Let's watch this piece of video
so you're gonna get a little taste of that.

235
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:30,300
Climbing has allowed me to travel all
over the world, which has really opened my

236
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:32,472
eyes to how the rest
of the world lives.

237
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:35,939
I mean, I see all these people, I mean
they're like a billion people on Earth

238
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,308
without access to power.

239
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,443
And so I started my foundation
sort of as an attempt to, like,

240
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:41,045
balance the cosmic scales.

241
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:44,948
So, I've been giving, maybe, like, a
third of my income every year through the

242
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,951
foundation to, like,
environmental non-profits.

243
00:16:46,953 --> 00:16:49,120
I mean, so, like off-grid solar
projects, things like that, like,

244
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:52,392
things that lift people out of
poverty, but also help the Earth.

245
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:09,139
Ah, you get out.

246
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:11,745
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

247
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:17,984
I met Sanni, book
touring in Seattle.

248
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:22,022
And then we just have been
hanging out ever since.

249
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:25,190
I think, I think this is our very first date
in Las Vegas, and I think we're climbing,

250
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:27,291
like, a very easy
multi-pitch together.

251
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:30,328
Um, you know I just took her up
this big tall route because then,

252
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,564
I kind of knew it
would blow her mind.

253
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:33,565
Is she a climber?

254
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:36,835
Um, Sanni's like a
little bit of a climber.

255
00:17:36,837 --> 00:17:41,142
She, she's just starting but I'd
hardly characterize her as a climber.

256
00:17:42,443 --> 00:17:45,609
You see straight in front of us, there's
like an depression that looks like a heart.

257
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:46,545
Yeah.

258
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:49,047
To the left of that,
that's Freerider.

259
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:51,582
This is like the whole valley,
like, we're driving in this highway.

260
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:52,885
Uh-hmm.

261
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:54,019
And then this is, like, the
valley loop from here to here,

262
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:56,354
the main rocks are all,
like, between here and here.

263
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:59,493
Okay, oh, maybe
I should read this.

264
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:02,463
No.

265
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:06,099
Alex was giving a talk in
Seattle, in December last year.

266
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:09,233
I didn't know anything
about him and I showed up.

267
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:11,336
Wait, you're wearing the same
shirt in half these photos.

268
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:12,502
I know.

269
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:14,004
Oh, Alex.

270
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:16,273
Well, because I don't have
anybody to help me with my wardrobe.

271
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:20,513
Oh and then, when I got my
book signed, I gave him my number.

272
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,320
Which was sort of a joke with
a friend but then evolved.

273
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:33,057
I just thought he was really
cute but also brutally honest,

274
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,225
but I'm really drawn to that.

275
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:37,595
Whoa, look how
precariously balanced it is.

276
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:40,097
But he's also just
a funny guy, he's weird.

277
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:43,169
You know, a weird dude,
and I find it interesting.

278
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,536
Oh, we tree
pose on the tree?

279
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:46,736
It's not wobbling.

280
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:49,307
It's totally wobbling,
what are you talking about.

281
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:51,442
Just for you.

282
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:54,447
- I'm waiting. Oh.
- Okay.

283
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:00,585
When you start
getting eaten by mosquitoes,

284
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:02,287
feel free to
just start climbing.

285
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:04,355
Just keep the Grigri on.

286
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:06,124
I'll wait.

287
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:08,628
Okay, whatever
you're comfy with.

288
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:13,263
Having the girlfriend
in the van is awesome.

289
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:17,135
I mean, she's cute and small and,
like, livens the place up a bit,

290
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:19,470
doesn't take up too much room.

291
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:23,077
I mean, it's, pretty much
makes life better in every way.

292
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:28,115
Alex, you got me tight?

293
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:33,120
This is nerve-racking.

294
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:46,431
When I was lowering Alex, I was watching him
come down the final section and the rope

295
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:48,299
went right through the
Grigri, right through my hands,

296
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:51,336
and right through the Grigri
and he dropped to the ground.

297
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:53,674
It was my fault that I didn't
watch the end of the rope.

298
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:58,177
It was just like, "Oh, my
gosh, what have I done?"

299
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:02,613
The x-ray didn't show much, but
then they took the CAT scan and then they

300
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:04,549
said it was, like, two
compression fractures and.

301
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:06,684
But they only focused on
they didn't focus on the lower.

302
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:10,624
Right after it happened
I wanted to break up with her.

303
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:14,992
I was like, "Oh, this is bad
for my climbing." But she said,

304
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:17,395
"Is that really gonna
make your life any better?"

305
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:19,998
I was like,
"No, probably not."

306
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,537
This is gonna feel a
little uncomfortable.

307
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,369
I said, you know,

308
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:28,472
"I think we can move past this
and I think you could have it all.

309
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:32,413
I think that you could have a
steady girlfriend and climb."

310
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:35,480
Exhale.

311
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:38,516
As it turns out, compression
fracture isn't too serious.

312
00:20:38,518 --> 00:20:41,386
They said that I could climb and just
be careful about pain management and

313
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:44,358
all that stuff.

314
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:47,392
But it's just a
little bit rattling.

315
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:50,427
Because I definitely know some people who
have fallen super far and survived or,

316
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:53,097
like, gone through a tree
and sort of been okay.

317
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:56,768
And now I'm like, "I don't know,
like, I don't think I'd be okay."

318
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,437
And so I imagine falling free soloing
or something from 50 meters up, I mean,

319
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,209
I realize that my body would
just explode on impact.

320
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:23,493
In 2012, I was here for the first
time and it was right before I went to

321
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:27,333
Yosemite for the season, and that was
like my best Yosemite season ever.

322
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:40,744
What was that, Alex?

323
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:42,747
I said you just passed halfway
and, uh, the rope's actually looking

324
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:45,552
pretty good now.

325
00:21:46,586 --> 00:21:49,520
Yeah, pretty nice rock.

326
00:21:49,522 --> 00:21:53,027
I think the climbing here in Morocco,
it's good training for El Cap.

327
00:21:54,762 --> 00:21:58,328
It's gonna make him strong, it's gonna get
him good at moving through the mountains,

328
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,267
it's gonna make him feel fit.

329
00:22:07,173 --> 00:22:11,545
Flowing through the mountains in the
ways that you do with Alex is addicting.

330
00:22:15,215 --> 00:22:19,619
His attitude towards risk, it
makes you feel kind of invincible,

331
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:29,463
which is emotionally appealing, but for
me I don't think it's the smartest thing.

332
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:34,632
Ah!

333
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:38,272
Climbing with Alex is,
it's like a vice in a way.

334
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:42,507
It's like smoking cigarettes
with beer or something.

335
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:45,675
It's like, I don't really wanna do it but
I just, like, let myself do it sometimes

336
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:46,877
because it's kinda nice.

337
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:50,383
- Yeah, buddy!
- Yo!

338
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:59,289
Can you read me your
journal entry for today?

339
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,795
It says, "Bey wall 7C+, one fallen
crux, two pumped, need more fitness."

340
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:09,500
Do you ever put things like "Saw
the biggest juniper tree of my life"?

341
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:11,735
No, not in the
climbing journal.

342
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:15,306
- Miss my dog.
- No.

343
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:17,340
- And my mom.
- I don't know, none?

344
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:19,846
- No, no.
- No. -All right.

345
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:36,560
Alright, Jim's gonna follow you guys down
partway, Clair's gonna pick you guys up at

346
00:23:36,562 --> 00:23:38,495
the bottom of the gully
going into the base.

347
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:39,931
Okay.

348
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:42,465
And then we'll be
shooting on the wall.

349
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:45,569
So, once we pass you guys, you guys
wrap and then hike to the summit basically?

350
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:46,704
Yeah.

351
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:49,440
Jimmy and I have
worked together for 10 years.

352
00:23:49,442 --> 00:23:51,442
We've climbed all
over the world.

353
00:23:51,444 --> 00:23:53,511
We are doing the
triple link up too, right?

354
00:23:53,513 --> 00:23:55,579
I mean, by the time we
get to Yosemite we're gonna be

355
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:57,885
as Cheyne says, "Yoked."

356
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:04,689
The team that Jimmy assembled
are all professional climbers.

357
00:24:04,691 --> 00:24:07,394
The best possible crew
for this kind of thing.

358
00:24:07,694 --> 00:24:09,626
And so in a way, I'm like, "This
is kinda awesome." You know,

359
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:13,166
it's kind of just like I get to
go climb with all my friends.

360
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,605
Mikey, we should put someone right
here because if you lean out you can see the

361
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:22,472
entire freaking route.

362
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:24,908
Then let's just put the 100
meter there and the 400 footer here.

363
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,812
Doubled up.

364
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:32,485
I've known Alex since he pretty much
started climbing in Yosemite, 2008 or 2009.

365
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:37,922
I've filmed Alex a handful
of times, free soloing.

366
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:41,392
And then we've also spent a couple of
winters together down in South America.

367
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:43,961
So, uh, we, the
time's added up.

368
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:46,396
Uh, I spend a lot of
time with him now.

369
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:50,568
So, I'm scared because I don't
wanna see anything happen to Alex.

370
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,337
I mean, it's one of the reasons that I
almost said no to this job, and, I mean,

371
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:55,639
I think Jimmy went through
the same stuff of being like,

372
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:58,311
"Do we really wanna
be part of this?"

373
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:02,512
I've always been conflicted
about shooting a film about free soloing

374
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:05,816
just because it's so dangerous.

375
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:11,021
It's hard to not imagine, your friend,
Alex, soloing something that's extremely

376
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:15,462
dangerous and you're making a film about
it, which might put undue pressure on him

377
00:25:15,962 --> 00:25:19,833
to do something, and him falling
through the frame to his death.

378
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:30,774
And we have to work through that and understand
that what we're doing is something that

379
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:32,979
we can live with even in
a worst-case scenario.

380
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,421
It's a funny thing, people who know
a little bit about climbing, they're like,

381
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:46,523
"Oh, he says he has it,
he's, he's totally safe."

382
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:50,997
And then people who really know exactly
what he's doing are freaked out.

383
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:54,365
My dad was always like, "I don't
want you to go ice climbing.

384
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:57,404
I don't want you to
free solo," you know.

385
00:25:57,837 --> 00:25:59,302
Just not, I wonder
if your dad had been like.

386
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:02,606
When he was my age, he had
had like 20 or 30 friends that had

387
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:04,040
died in the mountains.

388
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,644
And now I'm at that point where
I've had, you know, 30 or 40 friends

389
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:08,378
that have died
in the mountains.

390
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,914
That many?

391
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,514
Yeah, I counted
them a while ago.

392
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:13,082
I mean, like not friends
but people in our community.

393
00:26:13,084 --> 00:26:16,486
Yeah, people, yeah, yeah, totally,
like Kyle Dempster and Scott recently.

394
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:18,789
People that I have
met, yeah, I'm like, no, yeah.

395
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:21,625
I haven't had anybody die who I was,
like, really, really, close to yet.

396
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:25,299
Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.
I don't know.

397
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:30,667
I think everybody who has made
free soloing a big part of their life,

398
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:32,705
is dead now.

399
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:36,909
<i>John Bachar was a
pioneer of so-called free solo climbing,</i>

400
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:41,611
<i>he fell to his death this past
week at the age of 52 from a cliff.</i>

401
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:43,681
<i>And we're sorry
to have to report on the death of</i>

402
00:26:43,683 --> 00:26:46,016
<i>U.S. Climber Sean Leary.</i>

403
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:49,153
<i>Sean was killed in Utah and
was found a couple of days ago.</i>

404
00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:51,856
<i>Derek Hersey
was climbing in Yosemite Valley.</i>

405
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:54,394
<i>His body was found
Saturday morning.</i>

406
00:26:54,726 --> 00:26:58,028
<i>Hersey climbed, as usual,
alone without ropes.</i>

407
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,030
Most people that
are pushing the limits,

408
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:04,503
they have this mentality of "Screw
it, whatever happens, happens."

409
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:31,063
I think all the soloing he's
done has trained his mind.

410
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:35,669
He doesn't get emotionally affected
by it the way that a lot of people do.

411
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:39,203
And not knowing about the science
of that is that's probably a product

412
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:43,109
of your past more than
it is just a genetic thing.

413
00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:48,913
There's been a lot of speculation
about, like, how I deal with fear and,

414
00:27:48,915 --> 00:27:51,080
like, how I'm
able to free solo.

415
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:53,917
People are just like, "Oh, well,
he must be a thrill seeker.

416
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,622
There must be
something defective."

417
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:01,192
So when a writer
contacted me about doing an

418
00:28:01,194 --> 00:28:05,628
MRI, I thought it's kind of cool
just to go and get an MRI and, like,

419
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,130
see what's actually going on.

420
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:10,569
You know, scan your brain and then
see if it's all there structurally.

421
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:15,205
We're gonna
start the task now.

422
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:19,042
Remember to press the button every time
you see a new picture come up, okay?

423
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:20,913
<i>Okay.</i>

424
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:26,716
We'll see maybe it turns out I'm some
kind of freak creature or something.

425
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:29,086
I've had several ex-girlfriends
said that I have personality

426
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:31,020
disorders or things like that.

427
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:32,822
That there's something
wrong with me.

428
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:34,924
Emotionally stable?

429
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:36,226
Agree.

430
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:38,729
Ingenious, a deep thinker?

431
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:40,564
Disagree.

432
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:41,965
Tends to find
fault with others?

433
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,767
Agree somewhat.

434
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:46,537
Climbing a steep mountain
would be too scary for me?

435
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:48,705
I have trouble
controlling my impulses?

436
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:51,774
Is depressed?

437
00:28:51,776 --> 00:28:54,980
Hmm.

438
00:28:55,548 --> 00:28:57,580
Is my, is my brain intact?

439
00:28:57,582 --> 00:29:00,116
Your brain's intact and
it's, it's quite interesting.

440
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:04,020
Those little two dots that are
further towards the top of the screen,

441
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:06,560
that's the amygdala.

442
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:13,196
So an interesting thing, do you
have no activation in your amygdala?

443
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:16,101
There's just not much
going on in my brain, it seems.

444
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:20,604
Um, do you think my amygdala actually
just doesn't work or something?

445
00:29:20,606 --> 00:29:25,479
Your amygdala works, it's just that it
needs a much higher level of stimulation.

446
00:29:26,913 --> 00:29:31,315
Things that are typically stimulating
for most of the rest of us are

447
00:29:31,317 --> 00:29:33,317
not really doing it for you.

448
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:35,752
Maybe my amygdala's
just tired, you know,

449
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:38,859
from too many years
of being all gripped.

450
00:30:07,218 --> 00:30:11,257
I'm feeling quite fit, but, um, there's
such a mental component to free soloing.

451
00:30:12,425 --> 00:30:16,926
The big challenge is
controlling your mind, I guess.

452
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:19,329
Because you're not, you're not controlling
your fear, you're sort of just trying

453
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:22,167
to step outside of it.

454
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:27,740
Oh, no,
woo, sorry, Alex!

455
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:31,241
And when people talk about
trying to suppress your fear, I mean,

456
00:30:31,243 --> 00:30:33,844
I look at it in
a different way.

457
00:30:33,846 --> 00:30:38,147
I try to expand my comfort zone by
practicing the moves over and over again.

458
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:41,287
I work through the fear, until
it's just not scary anymore.

459
00:30:43,755 --> 00:30:45,254
Oh, no, no, no, no.

460
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:48,594
Oh, so slippery.

461
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,166
But, um, for years Freeblast
has given me the heebie-jeebies.

462
00:30:54,199 --> 00:31:00,005
You're standing on tiny edges, small
variations in the texture of the rock.

463
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:04,674
If you slip, your
hands can't hold you.

464
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:08,846
It's just the two tiny points of
contact that keep you from falling, and

465
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:12,586
when you step up,
there's only one.

466
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:15,354
Oh.

467
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:29,702
It's like, it looks so much better
today than yesterday, but we'll see.

468
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:36,039
I probably fell about 30 feet.

469
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:40,344
We're up there, we're roped up, Sanni's
belaying me, and then I just fell off,

470
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:41,511
I don't know.

471
00:31:41,513 --> 00:31:44,213
I just, I don't even know
how, I just, like, fell off.

472
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:45,982
Show me how much you
can go up and down on your own.

473
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:48,985
It's, it's like, you know.

474
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:51,254
I think this looks to me just like
your straightforward ankle sprain.

475
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:52,623
Okay.

476
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,924
So, you know, we say ankle sprain,
but more or less an ankle sprain

477
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,059
is torn ligaments.

478
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:57,462
- Yeah.
- That's what it is.

479
00:31:57,464 --> 00:31:58,829
...So what does that mean in terms
of, uh, like hiking and stuff?

480
00:31:58,831 --> 00:32:02,132
I mean, if I just, like, immobilize
it and then, uh, still just hike.

481
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:04,167
Yeah, I mean, you gotta' get
yourself through the first few days.

482
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:05,403
Yeah.

483
00:32:05,405 --> 00:32:06,736
Um, but after that and it's
just strengthening and rehab.

484
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:09,706
Well, and actually, can I make
it worse really, through activity?

485
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:14,147
Um, you could probably
do too much too soon.

486
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,921
Wait, you don't need
to keep that right.

487
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:26,490
I can worry as
much as I want internally,

488
00:32:26,492 --> 00:32:30,493
but if he doesn't do
this stuff he'd regret it.

489
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:35,299
If Alex and I got married and had kids,
I would feel a lot more willing to say

490
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:40,069
what I thought about what
was acceptable risk or not.

491
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,341
He should have
put his shoe on.

492
00:32:45,211 --> 00:32:48,181
- Stubborn.
- Stubborn.

493
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,088
I thought you were, you know, walking
and stuff now, I thought you're fine.

494
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,391
Oh, I am, but what.

495
00:33:00,393 --> 00:33:02,826
Doctors said you were
supposed to push it, Alex, come on.

496
00:33:02,828 --> 00:33:04,394
Don't you want
some watermelon?

497
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:07,530
Oh, well, good thing you have
a personal slave to do that for you.

498
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:09,899
Uh-huh, I know, I'm
pretty stoked about that.

499
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:12,802
All right, um, is it gonna be that
no matter how I do this, you're like,

500
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:14,338
"Why did you do it that way?"

501
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,972
I just want watermelon.

502
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:17,941
I kind of wanted to blame
Sanni to some extent because

503
00:33:17,943 --> 00:33:19,376
you're just like, "Whatever."

504
00:33:19,378 --> 00:33:20,911
I haven't been injured in, like,
seven years and then it's like I'm

505
00:33:20,913 --> 00:33:23,814
hanging out with this girl that doesn't
climb and I suddenly start getting

506
00:33:23,816 --> 00:33:25,249
injured all the time.

507
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:27,820
It's like you just
cut down a tree.

508
00:33:36,395 --> 00:33:41,231
When they say "active recovery,"
no, that doesn't mean you're walking

509
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:44,137
all over the place.

510
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:48,273
I would be happy if
he didn't free solo.

511
00:33:49,274 --> 00:33:53,844
I've always appreciated that he never
told me beforehand that he was gonna

512
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:55,812
free solo or anything.

513
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:58,882
I could come down on him and say,
"You shouldn't be doing that,"

514
00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:01,918
and alienate him,
and, uh, it would've alienated

515
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,520
him because that's
his, uh, whole life.

516
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:08,024
I think when he's free soloing,
that's when he feels the most alive,

517
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:10,260
the most everything, the most.

518
00:34:10,262 --> 00:34:11,794
Feels the most.

519
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:16,165
And how can you even think about taking
that away from somebody, you know?

520
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,238
I wouldn't.

521
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:31,147
I've been able to stand on one foot
while I put my harness and my shoes and

522
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:34,387
stuff on, and getting' this
like kind of, a minor victory.

523
00:34:36,622 --> 00:34:40,223
Um, I haven't put on my climbing
shoe basically since I did it.

524
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:43,262
So swollen. So tender.

525
00:34:47,298 --> 00:34:51,901
Unfortunately, crack climbing
is all ankle-dependent.

526
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:57,740
And Freerider is 3,000
feet of crack climbing.

527
00:34:57,742 --> 00:35:00,310
All my friends that have sprained
their ankles in serious ways have

528
00:35:00,312 --> 00:35:05,451
all been like, "Oh, it's gonna be at
least six months until it's normal."

529
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:08,285
If I can't get this
done in the next month

530
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:12,125
then the weather will change and
I'll have to wait until next year.

531
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:26,937
You know, a couple years ago,
I remember him telling me that he had never

532
00:35:26,939 --> 00:35:31,240
fallen unexpectedly in his life,
and now I've seen it happen twice

533
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:33,510
in the past, like, month.

534
00:35:33,512 --> 00:35:36,548
But when you hear stuff like that,
you start to wonder a little bit.

535
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:41,450
I had this dream the night before
he called me that he had, like,

536
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:44,453
wandered into our house and asked
us, and, like, started crying,

537
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:46,656
which really freaked me out
'cause Alex doesn't cry.

538
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:50,394
And then he had told me that he
fell free soloing and started, like,

539
00:35:50,396 --> 00:35:53,964
revealing all of his injuries, like
he pulled up his sleeve on his arm,

540
00:35:53,966 --> 00:35:57,466
and in my dream a bone just, like, fell
out of his arm and it was all messed up.

541
00:35:57,468 --> 00:36:02,305
And that, and it was this really, like,
kind of vivid, but super freaky dream.

542
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:06,245
And, uh, and then the next day he
called me and told me he hurt himself.

543
00:36:07,211 --> 00:36:09,046
Hi, hi, Ingrid.

544
00:36:09,048 --> 00:36:11,214
Sometimes,
one at a time.

545
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:12,716
Hi, hello, how's it going?

546
00:36:12,718 --> 00:36:15,718
- Hi, guys. -What's up, Fitz!
- So we got Fitz.

547
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,088
- Hi, Tommy, hi, Fitz!
- Are you gonna carve a pumpkin?

548
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,990
Nice, that's good.

549
00:36:19,992 --> 00:36:21,557
That seems off.

550
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:24,595
Eww.

551
00:36:24,597 --> 00:36:27,064
Alex said, "I want nothing
to do with the pumpkin carving,

552
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:28,665
and I won't carve anything
and I hate holidays."

553
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:30,434
I like having
fun when I have fun.

554
00:36:30,436 --> 00:36:33,972
I don't like being told
that it's time to have fun.

555
00:36:34,173 --> 00:36:37,243
Yeah, I think we need
to a little more.

556
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:38,674
Whoa, she's squirming.

557
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:40,743
I don't know. Do you have
a good grip on there?

558
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:43,613
You put that in my eye
again, I'm gonna drop you.

559
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:46,082
Why does it not
want to see us?

560
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:47,184
Just kidding, I won't.

561
00:36:47,186 --> 00:36:48,685
He keeps.

562
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:50,120
You gotta lift him
up more, you need to.

563
00:36:50,122 --> 00:36:51,655
Bye, Tom.

564
00:36:51,657 --> 00:36:53,323
Oh man, you should have
a lot of fear right now.

565
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:55,191
Okay, 'cause' I
feel a lot of anxiety.

566
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:58,294
No one in any part of my family has
hugged during all my formative years.

567
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:01,665
I had to teach myself how to hug
when I was, like, 23 or something.

568
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,466
'Cause I was like,
"Everyone seems to hug,

569
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:05,068
that seems like something
I should get into,"

570
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,303
and then I started,
like, practicing.

571
00:37:07,305 --> 00:37:08,705
Now I'm quite a good hugger.

572
00:37:08,707 --> 00:37:10,240
Yes.

573
00:37:10,242 --> 00:37:11,640
You see that the
pumpkin is a van?

574
00:37:11,642 --> 00:37:13,377
- I did see it.
- That's a precious van.

575
00:37:13,379 --> 00:37:14,577
Is it a cat?

576
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,345
- I did the cat. -That's good.
- Look at that.

577
00:37:16,347 --> 00:37:18,015
Um, I did it all by my.

578
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:19,383
Honestly, it does
look good like this.

579
00:37:19,385 --> 00:37:21,184
It looked terrible.

580
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:22,785
I think, yeah.

581
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:26,122
Part of the thing with the L word,
you know, is saying love and stuff,

582
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:29,459
is that, like, in my entire life no one
in any part of my family has ever used,

583
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:31,564
you know, that word.

584
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:38,334
My Mom has only spoken French to
my sister and I our whole lives.

585
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:41,071
She's a French teacher, so she
says, "Je t'aime" or whatever,

586
00:37:41,073 --> 00:37:45,111
and then my dad didn't
talk about anything.

587
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,745
Nobody had an
emotional bond with Charlie.

588
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:52,385
Charlie was probably what
we call nowadays Asperger's.

589
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:57,787
Charlie's obsession, what
everyone called monomania.

590
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:59,589
He loved to travel.

591
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:01,995
He lived to travel like
Alex lives to climb.

592
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:05,731
When he wasn't traveling,
things were not good.

593
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:09,598
Alex would do something and
we'd call him stupid names,

594
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,539
"Hey, bozo, don't do it like
that," just demeaning things.

595
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:18,107
If you learn that about your
self-worth when you're this big,

596
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:21,247
I don't think that goes away.

597
00:38:21,914 --> 00:38:25,484
I have no
recollection of that.

598
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:28,151
I don't think my dad
put down anybody.

599
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:32,492
I think my dad is like a teddy
bear, but dad was pretty morose.

600
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:37,461
And then the thing is once they got
divorced, then they both were, like,

601
00:38:37,463 --> 00:38:40,633
so much happier and it all seemed
great, but he died the next summer.

602
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:46,769
It's really kind of too bad that he
doesn't get to see how it all played out,

603
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:51,043
'cause he put so much effort
into nurturing my climbing.

604
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:54,979
But who knows?

605
00:38:54,981 --> 00:38:58,814
Maybe mom thought that he was, like,
holding us back or, like, you know,

606
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:02,118
not pushing us to achieve our
full potential or, like, whatever,

607
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,256
you know what I mean?

608
00:39:04,557 --> 00:39:07,624
My Mom's favorite sayings
are, "Presque ne compte pas,"

609
00:39:07,626 --> 00:39:11,531
"Almost doesn't count,"
or, uh, "Good enough isn't."

610
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:14,533
No matter how well I ever do at
anything, it's not that good.

611
00:39:20,472 --> 00:39:23,676
The bottomless pit
of self-loathing.

612
00:39:25,644 --> 00:39:30,450
I mean, that's definitely the
motivation for some soloing.

613
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:42,327
Here we are.

614
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:45,227
So I still
never, like, quietly,

615
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:47,330
quite understand what
happened when you fell, you,

616
00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:48,865
like, do you even know?

617
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:50,399
It should be just kinda, like.

618
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:52,468
Uh, I don't know why I fell off,
but I mean I know that my skin was,

619
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,703
like, hard and dry.

620
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:54,905
It was like lightly raining
kind of and like really windy.

621
00:39:54,907 --> 00:39:58,678
Weird he doesn't even
say he knows what happened.

622
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:02,345
He's like, "I, suddenly I was falling,"
which kind of surprised me because I feel

623
00:40:02,347 --> 00:40:04,848
like he's always so aware.

624
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,753
Or like maybe he's not
always totally aware.

625
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:13,290
You know Alex talks about having this
armor when he solos and I think as, like,

626
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:16,662
a friend or a family member of him,
you kinda have to have that same thing.

627
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,905
Like after that happened, for whatever reason,
it kinda like waked me up more than normal.

628
00:40:26,872 --> 00:40:29,205
You know, normally I'm just
like, "Oh, he's got it.

629
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:31,207
He's such, he's such a beast,
you know, he's gonna be fine."

630
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:37,180
But I just, like,

631
00:40:37,182 --> 00:40:41,486
am stressed out about the
thing a little bit, you know?

632
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:49,593
Look, I don't wanna fall off and
die either, but there's a satisfaction to

633
00:40:49,595 --> 00:40:53,299
challenging yourself and
doing something well.

634
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:57,600
That feeling is heightened when
you're for sure facing death.

635
00:40:57,602 --> 00:41:00,705
You can't make a mistake.

636
00:41:01,173 --> 00:41:06,475
If you're seeking perfection, free
soloing is as close as you can get.

637
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:11,416
And, uh, it does feel good to feel
perfect, like, for a brief moment.

638
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,555
My friends are like, "Oh, that'd be terrible,"
but if I kill myself in an accident,

639
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:22,459
they'll be like, "Oh, that was too
bad," but like life goes on, you know,

640
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:23,794
like they'll be fine.

641
00:41:23,796 --> 00:41:25,294
I mean, and I've had this problem
with girls a lot, you know.

642
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:28,598
They're like, "Oh, I really care
about you," I'm like, "No you don't."

643
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,232
Like if I perish,
like, it doesn't matter,

644
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:33,769
like you'll find somebody else, like,
that's not, that's not that big a deal.

645
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:36,474
I don't know.

646
00:41:36,874 --> 00:41:39,811
Maybe that's a
little too callous.

647
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:49,555
My foot is improving, but
it still swells up a bit.

648
00:41:53,557 --> 00:41:56,494
Rope!

649
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,366
Pretty epic rappel.

650
00:42:04,368 --> 00:42:07,240
Uh, we're just commuting
down the wall, kinda.

651
00:42:07,707 --> 00:42:10,009
We're just having
a good old time.

652
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:14,544
If you look at soloing El Cap objectively,
there are probably six pitches that

653
00:42:14,546 --> 00:42:17,347
worry me the most.

654
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:19,883
Just off the ground, there's
some insecure climbing.

655
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:22,519
And then Freeblast, Pitch 6,
being the one I fell off of,

656
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:25,421
which is obviously
a total botch.

657
00:42:25,423 --> 00:42:28,792
Then the down climb
to the Hollow Flake.

658
00:42:28,794 --> 00:42:31,794
And then
the Monster Offwidth,

659
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:34,599
which is super physical,
difficult style of climbing.

660
00:42:38,704 --> 00:42:41,838
When you're in the Monster Offwidth,
some part of you is always being

661
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,609
crushed in the mountain.

662
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:48,944
Imagine like the worst type of
Pilates class in the whole world,

663
00:42:48,946 --> 00:42:52,348
somebody like flogging as you do it,
and occasionally like sandpapering skin

664
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:56,756
off your body, telling you to hold
the position until you freakin' vomit,

665
00:42:57,122 --> 00:43:00,693
and if you lose the
position you die.

666
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:08,497
The Enduro Corner, in and of itself,
would have been the most difficult part of

667
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:10,535
virtually any big
solo I've done.

668
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:18,575
Your feet aren't on
any specific holds.

669
00:43:18,577 --> 00:43:20,743
What makes your feet stay to the wall
is the amount of pressure that you

670
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:23,816
pull with your hands.

671
00:43:24,483 --> 00:43:27,684
The harder you pull with your
hands, the more your feet stick.

672
00:43:27,686 --> 00:43:31,090
The most demanding for your
arms on the whole route.

673
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:35,927
And you've climbed 2,500 feet to get to the
Enduro Corner, so you're pretty fatigued.

674
00:43:39,097 --> 00:43:43,002
But the piece that I've always worried about
the most is the crux, the hardest part.

675
00:43:44,035 --> 00:43:49,541
To get past the crux, you have climb either
the Boulder Problem or the Teflon Corner.

676
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:54,046
2,000 off the ground, each of which
I've fallen off many times with a rope.

677
00:43:59,718 --> 00:44:02,821
The Teflon Corner, which is basically
like a 90-degree corner of glass,

678
00:44:03,222 --> 00:44:07,126
which is ultra-slippery,
just fills me with terror.

679
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:11,928
Pushing against the two walls of it,
with my feet on glass, my palms on glass,

680
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,897
and trying to make these little micro
adjustments to keep my balance centered so

681
00:44:14,899 --> 00:44:17,801
that I can push evenly
on all four sides of it.

682
00:44:17,803 --> 00:44:20,970
And then I imagine 2,500 feet of
air beneath my feet, you're, like,

683
00:44:20,972 --> 00:44:24,075
that's just a crazy
thing to think about.

684
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:29,381
The alternative is
the Boulder Problem.

685
00:44:30,548 --> 00:44:33,118
But the Boulder Problem has a 10-foot
section that's incredibly difficult.

686
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,522
It's a very
intricate sequence.

687
00:44:39,524 --> 00:44:43,596
You've got your right hand on a
crimp, left hand on a side pole,

688
00:44:44,129 --> 00:44:47,533
and then you put your right foot
onto this dimple thing.

689
00:44:47,966 --> 00:44:51,771
Right hand goes up to a small down-pulling
crimp, left foot goes into a little dish,

690
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:57,506
and then you drive up off the
left foot into the thumb press.

691
00:44:57,508 --> 00:44:59,642
That's the worst hold
on the entire route.

692
00:44:59,644 --> 00:45:02,548
So, you get maybe half
your thumb on the hold.

693
00:45:03,015 --> 00:45:07,520
Then you roll your two fingers
over the thumb, switch your feet,

694
00:45:08,687 --> 00:45:11,824
left foot stems out to this
really bad sloping black foothold.

695
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:17,495
Switch your thumbs.

696
00:45:19,763 --> 00:45:23,031
And then reach out left to a big
sloping bread loaf type hold that

697
00:45:23,033 --> 00:45:26,004
feels kind of grainy.

698
00:45:27,205 --> 00:45:31,876
From there, you either karate kick or
double-dyno to an edge on the opposite wall.

699
00:45:34,912 --> 00:45:38,580
In some ways, it makes more sense to do the
big two-handed jump because you're jumping to

700
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:41,921
a good edge so there's
actually something to catch.

701
00:45:48,026 --> 00:45:51,129
But the idea of jumping without a
rope seems completely outrageous,

702
00:45:51,329 --> 00:45:54,666
if you miss it, that's that.

703
00:45:56,135 --> 00:46:00,606
But then the karate kick always feels
like you're falling into the other wall,

704
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:04,075
which also feels
outrageous for soloing.

705
00:46:19,858 --> 00:46:23,126
Honestly, it wasn't like, I mean I
felt, like, pretty strong just pinching

706
00:46:23,128 --> 00:46:24,760
that shit and just
being that, put the foot.

707
00:46:24,762 --> 00:46:26,895
Well, as I said, when you actually
put your foot out there, I was like,

708
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:27,930
"Well, that doesn't
look that bad."

709
00:46:27,932 --> 00:46:32,670
Yeah, it's not
like crazy, but we'll see.

710
00:46:38,577 --> 00:46:40,209
Did you take
Ibuprofen this morning?

711
00:46:40,211 --> 00:46:42,879
Uh-hmm, I mean, I'm
going to right now also.

712
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:44,914
- For your ankle?
- Uh-hmm.

713
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:51,256
Hmm, I'm not, like, super stoked when
he goes soloing, because he's already a

714
00:46:52,122 --> 00:46:55,591
big part of my life.

715
00:46:55,593 --> 00:47:00,298
I tell Alex I love him all the time, and
he shows me that he loves me all the time.

716
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:03,999
And really just dive in.

717
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:05,234
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

718
00:47:05,236 --> 00:47:07,336
But I also tell him that I
also need words of affection.

719
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:10,141
- Yeah.
- We work on that.

720
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:16,015
In terms of learning how to communicate
emotion, Alex has a long way to go.

721
00:47:16,582 --> 00:47:22,185
And I said, "Sometimes I'm gonna tell you
how I feel, and I just need you to say it

722
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:24,890
totally makes sense
that you feel that way."

723
00:47:25,624 --> 00:47:28,861
He was like, "Yeah, I can
understand why you feel that way."

724
00:47:30,195 --> 00:47:32,995
I was like, "I don't
really think that you do,

725
00:47:32,997 --> 00:47:35,900
but I'm glad
that you're trying."

726
00:47:37,669 --> 00:47:40,002
Alex, we have
excellent team skills.

727
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:42,270
Well, I thought, I feel like
we're not quite killin' it, but we're,

728
00:47:42,272 --> 00:47:43,740
I think we're doin' well.

729
00:47:43,742 --> 00:47:46,142
Really?
I think we're doing great.

730
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:49,715
I'm very happy for Alex
and Sanni that it works so well.

731
00:47:50,347 --> 00:47:53,351
And I'm, I think I'm just
impressed by their relationship,

732
00:47:55,854 --> 00:47:59,892
but to free solo at that level, you
really have to have the mental armor.

733
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:04,330
Having that romantic relationship
around is detrimental to that armor.

734
00:48:05,263 --> 00:48:08,798
You have to focus and inherently
a close romantic relationship

735
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,165
removes that armor.

736
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:13,638
You kinda can't have
both at the same time.

737
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:41,997
There's always something that
has to give you the confidence to

738
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:44,167
go out and free solo a route.

739
00:48:44,169 --> 00:48:48,040
So sometimes, that confidence just
comes from feeling super, super fit.

740
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,709
Sometimes, that confidence comes
through preparation and rehearsal.

741
00:48:52,376 --> 00:48:55,146
But I mean there's always something
that makes you feel ready.

742
00:49:02,787 --> 00:49:04,953
There's something to be said for, like,
soloing a bunch of pitches to, like,

743
00:49:04,955 --> 00:49:08,327
get into that right space.

744
00:49:10,729 --> 00:49:12,798
It's a little stressful.

745
00:49:13,131 --> 00:49:16,732
It's just, it's unreal.

746
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:18,368
Yeah.

747
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,770
And as much as I trust Alex and
I know that he's really methodical, uh,

748
00:49:21,772 --> 00:49:24,943
if you're pushing the edge,
eventually you find the edge.

749
00:49:28,379 --> 00:49:29,979
But then there's just some
things that you're, like, well,

750
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:33,515
you just have to push that far because
they're just, they're just that cool.

751
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:36,320
And El Cap is that cool.

752
00:49:39,224 --> 00:49:42,695
There's incremental advances
that happen in all kinds of things,

753
00:49:43,095 --> 00:49:46,865
but every once in a while there's
just this iconic leap, soloing El Cap,

754
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:50,836
if he pulls this off,
is this quantum leap.

755
00:49:51,669 --> 00:49:55,840
It is hard to imagine somebody up
there by themselves, without a rope,

756
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:58,374
where it's pretty much all the
other big cliffs around here.

757
00:49:58,376 --> 00:50:01,080
I can kinda get it.

758
00:50:01,646 --> 00:50:03,912
How many times have you
soloed both those routes now?

759
00:50:03,914 --> 00:50:08,049
Well, Astroman, three or four
times, but the Rostrum, I mean, literally,

760
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:10,153
like, fifty, sixty.

761
00:50:10,155 --> 00:50:12,390
Wait, you've soloed
the Rostrum 50 or 60 times?

762
00:50:13,024 --> 00:50:15,024
It was like part
of the circuit and I would,

763
00:50:15,026 --> 00:50:17,160
I would go there and I
would do it at least twice.

764
00:50:17,162 --> 00:50:19,430
Like I was just glommed on.

765
00:50:19,696 --> 00:50:20,930
Uh-huh.

766
00:50:20,932 --> 00:50:22,298
Not like I had a fear, but
just kind of like this is how.

767
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,566
Yeah, because you're so tight. You
know, I love that about soloing.

768
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:26,468
My footwork gets really good.

769
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,037
Yeah, really,
yeah totally, yeah.

770
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:30,339
But it's not for anybody
else, this is just for me.

771
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:32,073
Yeah, yeah, just because
you feel like you're.

772
00:50:32,075 --> 00:50:33,810
And after Astroman,
people were like,

773
00:50:33,812 --> 00:50:35,377
"Ah, we wanna film
you, film you up there,"

774
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:38,316
and I'm like, "Not interested,
not even slightly."

775
00:50:38,517 --> 00:50:42,185
For me, it was so incredibly important
to be doing it for the right reasons.

776
00:50:42,187 --> 00:50:45,220
I mean, I think I'm still doing
everything for the right reasons,

777
00:50:45,222 --> 00:50:48,457
and I'm still totally stoked, but I feel
like from the outside observer, you know,

778
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:51,827
they'd be like, "Oh, he's got a
movie crew," like clearly that's the

779
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:53,463
wrong reasons, you know.

780
00:50:53,465 --> 00:50:59,071
The worst thing about having a
film crew is if it changes your mindset.

781
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,117
I think Alex is
almost ready to do it.

782
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:15,387
He just wants to take
a few more practice laps.

783
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:21,926
And we're just trying to figure
out all of our camera positions.

784
00:51:27,164 --> 00:51:31,836
I mean the soloing
headspace is so fragile.

785
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:36,571
We wanna film it well, but it's about
not getting in his way and making sure

786
00:51:36,573 --> 00:51:39,544
he has the experience he wants.

787
00:51:44,349 --> 00:51:47,182
The worst possible scenario
is that one of us would do something

788
00:51:47,184 --> 00:51:49,084
that would kill him.

789
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:50,352
Is it gonna be the drone?

790
00:51:50,354 --> 00:51:51,421
Is it gonna be
one of the ropes?

791
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:55,093
Is it gonna be us accidently
knocking off a rock?

792
00:51:58,595 --> 00:52:01,263
The idea of falling off is, you
know, obviously I'm trying to avoid that,

793
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:05,434
but it's like kind of okay
if it's just by myself.

794
00:52:05,436 --> 00:52:08,370
But, like, I wouldn't wanna fall off right
in front of my friends, 'cause that's like,

795
00:52:08,372 --> 00:52:11,609
that's kind of messed up.

796
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:15,314
Where are you comfortable
with us being essentially?

797
00:52:15,981 --> 00:52:18,915
Well, do you have
like.

798
00:52:18,917 --> 00:52:20,249
The traverse into it?

799
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:21,883
- Uh-hmm.
- Yeah.

800
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:25,086
And then a, just a camera above, sitting
above the Boulder Pitch, essentially.

801
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:27,589
- Yeah. -It's distracting.
- Yeah, it's distracting.

802
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:30,593
Well, it's not just distracting,
but it's also like, you know,

803
00:52:30,595 --> 00:52:34,166
nobody wants to see
that, I don't know.

804
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,169
Like, yeah, I don't,
yeah, it's better not to.

805
00:52:40,171 --> 00:52:42,374
Some things you're like, meh.

806
00:52:43,006 --> 00:52:46,912
Yeah, okay.

807
00:52:49,046 --> 00:52:51,981
So should I rally into the valley
and try to like round out plans?

808
00:52:51,983 --> 00:52:54,151
Yeah, yeah.

809
00:52:57,988 --> 00:53:00,656
Um, the moon set
at 4:50 behind the ridge.

810
00:53:00,658 --> 00:53:05,394
The spire was touched by the sun at 7:30 and
by 8:05, the sun was to the crux probably.

811
00:53:05,396 --> 00:53:06,629
- 8:05?
- Okay.

812
00:53:06,631 --> 00:53:08,731
You don't want it to be
sunny when you get to the crux,

813
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:12,001
and it takes three or four hours
to get up to the Boulder Problem,

814
00:53:12,003 --> 00:53:14,336
and it's fall so in
order to beat the sun,

815
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:16,671
you basically have
to start in the dark.

816
00:53:16,673 --> 00:53:21,280
I kinda think just leave the
ground at 4:00 again, basically.

817
00:53:29,153 --> 00:53:30,352
I don't know.

818
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:32,925
I'm starting to get
kind of psyched.

819
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,194
The moment of just letting go to it is
in some ways the most peaceful because

820
00:53:38,196 --> 00:53:39,761
then it's like
you just do your thing.

821
00:53:39,763 --> 00:53:42,934
There's no more stress, there's no more
anxiety, there's no fear, whatever,

822
00:53:43,434 --> 00:53:45,667
you just go up and do it.

823
00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:48,974
I put on my tight shoes today,
it's like very exciting.

824
00:53:49,874 --> 00:53:53,209
It would be, like, it would be like a
samurai pulling out his favorite sword,

825
00:53:53,211 --> 00:53:54,609
you know like,

826
00:53:54,611 --> 00:53:56,544
"Oh, my gosh,"
you know, and now I'm like,

827
00:53:56,546 --> 00:53:59,147
"Oh, time for the,
the finely crafted blade."

828
00:53:59,149 --> 00:54:02,253
So stoked.
I like sinking into it.

829
00:54:02,854 --> 00:54:08,290
It's, it goes with the Jedi thing,
the samurai with the, and then I just

830
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:09,959
started taking Ibuprofen.

831
00:54:09,961 --> 00:54:13,098
I've been, like, icing a bunch and, like,
I think my foot's gonna be pretty good.

832
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:16,568
Yeah, what does Sanni say
when you talk to her about it?

833
00:54:16,867 --> 00:54:18,434
Um, I mean I haven't
talked to her that much.

834
00:54:18,436 --> 00:54:20,069
She's been, like, asking a lot of
questions like, "Oh, you know, how's it?"

835
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:24,673
And I'm, I just haven't really like, I'm
just like, "Oh, we'll see, we'll see."

836
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:28,245
You know, the fewer people know
anything, the better really.

837
00:54:30,414 --> 00:54:33,716
I had a dream and you were
limping and you were like, had caught,

838
00:54:33,718 --> 00:54:38,187
had like made the exact same fall and
fallen on your ankle in the exact same way.

839
00:54:38,189 --> 00:54:39,754
That's really nice, San San.

840
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:41,223
It was like tragic.

841
00:54:41,225 --> 00:54:42,457
I love hearing
stories about that.

842
00:54:42,459 --> 00:54:45,428
- I woke up, like, "Oh my gosh.
- I hope that didn't happen."

843
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:47,830
That's, that's really nice.

844
00:54:47,832 --> 00:54:49,698
Um, what is your,
is your daypack?

845
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,466
They're bringing it up
there for you and Peter?

846
00:54:51,468 --> 00:54:53,435
Um, no.

847
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:56,071
For me tomorrow, probably.

848
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:58,807
For on the mountain?

849
00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:00,810
Um, for the summit, yeah.

850
00:55:00,812 --> 00:55:03,379
Hmm, you and Peter are gonna
try and do the whole thing?

851
00:55:03,381 --> 00:55:06,247
Uh, no, Peter won't be here
for a couple of days probably.

852
00:55:06,249 --> 00:55:08,450
Oh, who are you
climbing with tomorrow?

853
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:11,419
Um, yeah, we'll just see.

854
00:55:11,421 --> 00:55:13,457
Oh, okay, okay.

855
00:55:16,593 --> 00:55:20,129
Wait, so are you thinking of soloing it
tomorrow, is that why you're not telling me who

856
00:55:20,131 --> 00:55:21,629
you're climbing with?

857
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:24,265
Um, well, I'm not like
not telling you, but yeah.

858
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:25,533
Whoa, Alex.

859
00:55:25,535 --> 00:55:27,769
- Whoa.
- Whoa. -Whoa.

860
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:29,138
How do you feel?

861
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,374
I'm, you know,
I mean, excited.

862
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:35,444
That's really exciting. Is it
that feeling when you're like...

863
00:55:35,446 --> 00:55:37,745
So exciting I'm gonna
go right back to my book.

864
00:55:37,747 --> 00:55:40,251
Where you're like, no,
I'm not reading it.

865
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:42,818
When did you decide?

866
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,319
When did you decide
to do it tomorrow?

867
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:47,492
No, just, you know, uh, yesterday
or the day before or something.

868
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:51,229
Hmm, I'm processing.

869
00:56:16,754 --> 00:56:19,787
I wanna, like I wanna have this more,
like, holistic approach that you have where

870
00:56:19,789 --> 00:56:21,022
you're like "Well,
we're all gonna die,

871
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:23,526
like might as well do what we
wanna do while we're here and

872
00:56:23,528 --> 00:56:27,832
it's okay when people die," but I feel
like I want you to meet me halfway

873
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:34,138
and when you solo to
take me into the equation

874
00:56:35,305 --> 00:56:36,571
and then I think you said...

875
00:56:36,573 --> 00:56:39,376
Is there a question? -Some,
there's going to be. -Okay.

876
00:56:39,776 --> 00:56:42,678
Um, would putting me into the
equation actually ever change anything?

877
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,716
Would you actually make
decisions differently?

878
00:56:46,084 --> 00:56:50,856
If I had some kind of obligation
to maximize my lifespan, then like yeah,

879
00:56:51,155 --> 00:56:53,222
obviously I'd have to
give up soloing and, um.

880
00:56:53,224 --> 00:56:56,825
Was me asking you, do you
see that as an obligation now?

881
00:56:56,827 --> 00:56:58,526
...Uh, no, no.

882
00:56:58,528 --> 00:57:00,196
Oh.

883
00:57:00,198 --> 00:57:05,801
No, but I appreciate your concerns and
I, you know, I respect that, but, but I,

884
00:57:05,803 --> 00:57:07,937
in no way, feel obligated, no.

885
00:57:07,939 --> 00:57:09,370
To maximize lifetime?

886
00:57:09,372 --> 00:57:12,443
No, no, I don't know.

887
00:57:14,012 --> 00:57:18,649
Um, but I mean like you saying, "Be safer,"
I'm kinda like well, I mean I can't.

888
00:57:19,783 --> 00:57:21,584
You know, I'm already
doing my best.

889
00:57:21,586 --> 00:57:23,752
So I could just, like, not do certain
things, but then you have, like,

890
00:57:23,754 --> 00:57:26,488
weird simmering resentment because
it's things that you love most in life

891
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,457
have now been squashed.

892
00:57:28,459 --> 00:57:31,396
You know what I mean?

893
00:57:45,776 --> 00:57:49,611
- What time is it? -3:30.
- Oh.

894
00:57:49,613 --> 00:57:52,513
I just woke up one
minute before my alarm.

895
00:57:52,515 --> 00:57:55,220
Yeah, you woke up
before or after?

896
00:57:56,419 --> 00:57:59,523
One minute before.

897
00:58:15,972 --> 00:58:19,543
It's like always about, like,
excellence and perfection.

898
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,584
And I was certainly raised that way, you
know, that you need to, you need to perform.

899
00:58:29,452 --> 00:58:32,453
It's also just like kind of rad because
you're doing something for the first time

900
00:58:32,455 --> 00:58:34,892
in human history.

901
00:58:49,307 --> 00:58:52,611
Let's hope it's
a low gravity day.

902
00:58:54,812 --> 00:58:57,446
Bye, Huck, see
you at the ground.

903
00:58:57,448 --> 00:59:00,618
- Meet you in the ground.
- See you, buddy.

904
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:30,881
This sucks.
I don't wanna be here.

905
00:59:36,354 --> 00:59:39,323
I'm over it.

906
00:59:39,856 --> 00:59:40,988
What happened?

907
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:43,459
I cheated on
the slab down there.

908
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:44,959
Might as well radio it.

909
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:47,731
Do you
wanna talk to him?

910
00:59:48,966 --> 00:59:51,633
I don't even know what to say,
it's, like, kind of embarrassing.

911
00:59:51,635 --> 00:59:53,836
Uh, hey, whoever's on
the radio, this is Alex.

912
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:56,640
Um, I think I'm bailing.

913
00:59:58,608 --> 01:00:00,408
Wait, could you repeat?

914
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,678
<i>I
think he's bailing from heart.</i>

915
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,716
<i>Bailing
from heart, that's correct.</i>

916
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:11,756
It's kind
of disturbing.

917
01:00:15,992 --> 01:00:18,894
Yeah, I wonder what it was.

918
01:00:18,896 --> 01:00:21,729
I don't know if I can
try with everybody watching.

919
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:23,564
It's too scary.

920
01:00:23,566 --> 01:00:26,503
Just can't, like,
try for real.

921
01:00:40,684 --> 01:00:43,819
- Oh, my gosh. -Good morning.
- What are you doing?

922
01:00:43,821 --> 01:00:45,120
Oh, I bailed.

923
01:00:45,122 --> 01:00:46,687
You bailed, oh?

924
01:00:46,689 --> 01:00:47,890
Yeah, it's chilly outside.

925
01:00:47,892 --> 01:00:49,557
It's chilly, okay.

926
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:51,662
Okay.

927
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:53,495
What's going on?

928
01:00:53,497 --> 01:00:58,103
Well, not much.

929
01:00:58,303 --> 01:00:59,502
What's up?

930
01:00:59,504 --> 01:01:01,602
Oh, I just, I went up to Free
Blast and I was, like, nah,

931
01:01:01,604 --> 01:01:03,138
I'm not gonna' do it. But...

932
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,606
Good for you.

933
01:01:04,608 --> 01:01:05,973
Yeah, well, it's just a
little weird, you know?

934
01:01:05,975 --> 01:01:07,709
- Yup.
- Yeah. -No.

935
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:11,713
Right, I mean there's just too many random,
random folks about and stuff, whatever.

936
01:01:11,715 --> 01:01:13,048
Uh-hmm, yeah.

937
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:15,818
But, like, basically I did the
first half of the first slab.

938
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,153
Uh-hmm.

939
01:01:17,155 --> 01:01:19,555
And then, uh, and then I
just was like, "Oh, I don't know."

940
01:01:19,557 --> 01:01:20,756
And my feet.

941
01:01:20,758 --> 01:01:22,191
Right, you made the
perfect decision.

942
01:01:22,193 --> 01:01:23,758
I don't know though,
I'm just like.

943
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,959
Yeah.

944
01:01:24,961 --> 01:01:27,028
But now it all has to
drag on longer, I'm like.

945
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:29,897
You, yeah, I mean, you
never have to go for it.

946
01:01:29,899 --> 01:01:30,832
You can just.

947
01:01:30,834 --> 01:01:32,801
Well, I just need
it to end, you know.

948
01:01:32,803 --> 01:01:34,236
Yeah, yeah, all the...

949
01:01:34,238 --> 01:01:36,138
Yeah, you know what
I'm talking about.

950
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,643
The circus surrounding you.

951
01:01:42,512 --> 01:01:45,816
I just can't imagine,
I wonder if he got nervous.

952
01:01:47,184 --> 01:01:49,818
Is that possible?

953
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,722
Oh, man.

954
01:01:52,055 --> 01:01:54,957
There's a lot of things that I
don't totally understand about him.

955
01:01:54,959 --> 01:01:56,191
You know?

956
01:01:56,193 --> 01:01:57,559
Yeah, I know.

957
01:01:57,561 --> 01:02:01,865
I mean in some ways it'd be kind of
reassuring that Spock has nerves.

958
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:15,711
It was the first time I've ever
gone up on something like real and

959
01:02:15,713 --> 01:02:17,513
then not done it.

960
01:02:17,515 --> 01:02:22,720
But it's also the first time I've ever gone up
on something real with people all watching.

961
01:02:22,986 --> 01:02:26,591
By myself, I maybe would have just,
like, persevered, I don't know,

962
01:02:27,158 --> 01:02:30,792
maybe I just suck, but,

963
01:02:30,794 --> 01:02:34,165
you know, at least I've
like, at least I've tried.

964
01:02:57,021 --> 01:02:58,957
Thanks for
meeting us again.

965
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:06,562
It's funny, it always has a certain
smell in here, and I wonder if it's

966
01:03:06,564 --> 01:03:07,995
the paint or the.

967
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:10,501
Yeah, it's
the fresh paint.

968
01:03:10,868 --> 01:03:13,838
Dining room with
probably also bookshelves.

969
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:16,671
Wait, so what
am, what am I signing?

970
01:03:16,673 --> 01:03:18,941
"Buyers of unit approves
the home inspection."

971
01:03:18,943 --> 01:03:24,078
Yeah, Alex told me I get
one furniture question a day.

972
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,048
I've always thought
that I ought to buy a house,

973
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:29,651
just haven't quite had the energy
to make it all happen myself.

974
01:03:29,653 --> 01:03:32,220
I think Sanni will be stoked to have
a place to live and there's so much

975
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:34,725
climbing all around Vegas.

976
01:03:35,193 --> 01:03:40,532
Big sectional here and
chair or like sofa and two chairs.

977
01:03:43,267 --> 01:03:45,970
Potential, like, bar area.

978
01:03:47,637 --> 01:03:49,270
I would just sleep
straight on the carpet.

979
01:03:49,272 --> 01:03:51,542
It'd be like.

980
01:03:58,782 --> 01:04:02,883
Alex was a huge jerk watching
me struggle with the tape measure,

981
01:04:02,885 --> 01:04:05,921
being an asshole standing by
commenting on how stupid I look,

982
01:04:05,923 --> 01:04:10,225
but not actually offering to help
or be productive or kind in any way.

983
01:04:10,227 --> 01:04:13,060
And so now it's
all gone to shit.

984
01:04:13,062 --> 01:04:16,166
Yeah, you're asking about our
domestic bliss, it's nonexistent.

985
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:19,834
You're so angry, but
it's cracking, it's cracking.

986
01:04:19,836 --> 01:04:21,035
It's not cracking.

987
01:04:21,037 --> 01:04:22,303
Yeah, it is, it's cracking.

988
01:04:22,305 --> 01:04:23,905
No, it's not,
I'm still angry.

989
01:04:23,907 --> 01:04:25,207
I can tell you're cracking.

990
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:26,741
I'm not cracking.

991
01:04:26,743 --> 01:04:28,310
But you're not that
angry, you're cracking.

992
01:04:28,312 --> 01:04:29,977
I'm not cracking.

993
01:04:29,979 --> 01:04:32,046
This is firm
resolve of hatred.

994
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:34,251
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

995
01:04:35,653 --> 01:04:38,856
Oh, boy.

996
01:04:40,057 --> 01:04:42,790
That one seems very
big and very wide.

997
01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:44,329
Oh.

998
01:04:46,062 --> 01:04:48,700
Whoa, that seems really deep.

999
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:51,932
We should just ask somebody.

1000
01:04:51,934 --> 01:04:53,234
Hmm, I know.

1001
01:04:53,236 --> 01:04:54,669
Let's keep looking
for the smaller ones.

1002
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:56,004
Oh, this is the $400, that's.

1003
01:04:56,006 --> 01:04:57,272
That's it!

1004
01:04:57,274 --> 01:04:58,439
That's it, that's our jam.

1005
01:04:58,441 --> 01:04:59,941
This is actually,
like, kind of perfect.

1006
01:04:59,943 --> 01:05:02,847
This is like so adequate.

1007
01:05:05,048 --> 01:05:06,415
We have a fridge!

1008
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:09,354
- Hmm.
- Yay! -That success.

1009
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,419
Is it possible?

1010
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:16,961
We had like a sort of a rough patch
since Yosemite, where, I don't know,

1011
01:05:17,727 --> 01:05:21,698
Alex isn't super good about
putting a name to how he's feeling.

1012
01:05:21,932 --> 01:05:24,732
So, he'll be like, "I know I'm cranky, but
I don't really know why and I'm not gonna

1013
01:05:24,734 --> 01:05:27,204
take the time
to figure it out."

1014
01:05:27,738 --> 01:05:30,772
I'm patient, but
I also have self-respect.

1015
01:05:30,774 --> 01:05:34,846
And then, you know, the second that I
start being mad, he's just like "foom."

1016
01:05:38,247 --> 01:05:39,814
How do you make coffee?

1017
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:42,316
You need like a filter.

1018
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:46,020
Definitely my relationship with Sanni
is, like, the most healthy and stable

1019
01:05:46,022 --> 01:05:48,191
relationship I've ever had.

1020
01:05:48,524 --> 01:05:50,927
Oh, look at that, the only
thing in the cupboard.

1021
01:05:51,528 --> 01:05:53,327
Certainly more communicative.

1022
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:55,830
Even Sanni over the year and a
half we've been dating is like,

1023
01:05:55,832 --> 01:05:57,865
"Wow, you've
really blossomed."

1024
01:05:57,867 --> 01:05:59,535
Well, that's not
really promising.

1025
01:05:59,537 --> 01:06:02,370
And you think you put the coffee in there
and then you push the water through it?

1026
01:06:02,372 --> 01:06:03,738
I don't how to, um.

1027
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:06,140
Hello,
oh, my gosh, wow!

1028
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:07,809
Oh, like, how's, why?

1029
01:06:07,811 --> 01:06:09,243
Is this what it is
to be, um, a homeowner?

1030
01:06:09,245 --> 01:06:11,446
You get breakfast and coffee
made for you every day?

1031
01:06:11,448 --> 01:06:14,082
I don't, I don't understand
the, do you put the coffee in here and

1032
01:06:14,084 --> 01:06:15,149
then put the water to it?

1033
01:06:15,151 --> 01:06:16,383
It's really
complicated.

1034
01:06:16,385 --> 01:06:19,090
But she sees
things in a different way.

1035
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:22,759
For Sanni the point of
life is like happiness.

1036
01:06:22,959 --> 01:06:26,897
To be with people that make you feel
fulfilled and to have a good time.

1037
01:06:27,198 --> 01:06:30,234
For me it's all
about performance.

1038
01:06:30,667 --> 01:06:34,739
The thing is anybody
can be happy and cozy.

1039
01:06:34,939 --> 01:06:38,376
Nothing good happens in the
world by being happy and cozy.

1040
01:06:40,477 --> 01:06:44,415
You know, like nobody achieves anything
great because they're happy and cozy.

1041
01:06:45,849 --> 01:06:50,287
You never wanna feel like you're
getting in the way of someone's goal.

1042
01:06:51,155 --> 01:06:55,959
And it's really hard for me
to grasp why he wants this.

1043
01:06:57,794 --> 01:07:02,466
But it's his dream and he
obviously still really wants it.

1044
01:07:06,269 --> 01:07:09,437
It's about
being a warrior.

1045
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:12,439
It doesn't matter about
the cause necessarily.

1046
01:07:12,441 --> 01:07:15,946
This is your path and you will
pursue it with excellence.

1047
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:20,917
You face your fear because
your goal demands it.

1048
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:26,090
That is the goddamn
warrior spirit.

1049
01:07:26,722 --> 01:07:30,327
I think that the free soloing mentality
is pretty close to warrior culture,

1050
01:07:31,294 --> 01:07:35,832
where you give something 100% focus
because your life depends on it.

1051
01:08:06,129 --> 01:08:10,631
The move I gave up on in the fall was a
right foot on this little edge right here,

1052
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:14,905
and I basically just have to like stand
on the right foot and just trust it.

1053
01:08:15,106 --> 01:08:18,173
And I was like, "I don't really wanna
have my whole life depend on like standing

1054
01:08:18,175 --> 01:08:21,145
on this one right foot."

1055
01:08:22,412 --> 01:08:25,249
But maybe I
can find another way.

1056
01:08:31,454 --> 01:08:35,059
I think this is like kind
of the business of the whole deal,

1057
01:08:36,092 --> 01:08:39,393
which is interesting because if you're
climbing with a rope it's not at all,

1058
01:08:39,395 --> 01:08:42,532
but without a rope it is.

1059
01:09:11,494 --> 01:09:17,133
That's my variation,
I just don't know.

1060
01:09:25,676 --> 01:09:30,414
I think that he's only comfortable
climbing in front of the camera or in front of

1061
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,385
any other people when he's
really confident and secure.

1062
01:09:34,985 --> 01:09:38,389
And that's been the dilemma that this
whole production has faced, right?

1063
01:09:38,622 --> 01:09:39,821
- Yeah.
- From the beginning.

1064
01:09:39,823 --> 01:09:42,557
Our being there is
always going to change things.

1065
01:09:42,559 --> 01:09:46,294
What made the big difference for me
is that he did turn around last year.

1066
01:09:46,296 --> 01:09:50,101
He didn't feel the pressure to have
to do it because we were there.

1067
01:09:51,267 --> 01:09:54,605
And I really, like
that to me said a lot.

1068
01:09:55,504 --> 01:09:57,608
It meant a lot.

1069
01:10:14,992 --> 01:10:18,593
Is that what you'd
want, us not to film it?

1070
01:10:18,595 --> 01:10:21,129
Hmm, no.

1071
01:10:21,131 --> 01:10:24,299
I mean, hard to say it but I care
about doing it a lot more than I care

1072
01:10:24,301 --> 01:10:26,000
about it being filmed.

1073
01:10:26,002 --> 01:10:27,469
You know?

1074
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:30,071
You could put your foot down
at any time, and, and, you know.

1075
01:10:30,073 --> 01:10:31,572
Yeah, I mean,
I'm aware of it.

1076
01:10:31,574 --> 01:10:33,340
Like, if I want to, I just won't
tell anybody and I'm just gonna do it

1077
01:10:33,342 --> 01:10:34,541
on my own terms.

1078
01:10:34,543 --> 01:10:35,809
Yeah, exactly.

1079
01:10:35,811 --> 01:10:38,179
Like whatever, like I mean
that's obviously on the table.

1080
01:10:38,181 --> 01:10:40,348
But obviously that would
hose everybody, you know?

1081
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:41,448
Yeah.

1082
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:42,783
If you woke up
tomorrow and you were like,

1083
01:10:42,785 --> 01:10:44,051
"You know what,
screw all of this,

1084
01:10:44,053 --> 01:10:46,420
I just don't care enough, like
I don't feel good enough."

1085
01:10:46,422 --> 01:10:47,923
You know,
but that's like, yeah,

1086
01:10:47,925 --> 01:10:50,125
I mean, of course I, I mean, I know
I could do that and just walk away.

1087
01:10:50,127 --> 01:10:55,066
But it's like, you know, I
mean, you know, I don't want to.

1088
01:11:07,543 --> 01:11:11,246
Having all these people around
requires a higher level of preparation,

1089
01:11:11,248 --> 01:11:14,085
a higher level of
confidence basically.

1090
01:11:14,284 --> 01:11:17,618
I need to like dial it in so much that,
you know, it doesn't matter if there's

1091
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:20,321
like a stadium of people watching me because
it's so easy for me that I'm just like,

1092
01:11:20,323 --> 01:11:22,593
"Check this out."
And just do it.

1093
01:11:24,026 --> 01:11:27,530
Pitch one, stay left towards the
top, splitter, it feels more secure.

1094
01:11:28,565 --> 01:11:31,532
Pitch two, trust the right
foot, rock on, trust the feet,

1095
01:11:31,534 --> 01:11:33,167
right hand to
the last under cling.

1096
01:11:33,169 --> 01:11:34,835
Eight, easy romp. Go fast.

1097
01:11:34,837 --> 01:11:38,173
Nine, stay outside of the
down climb, careful of blocks.

1098
01:11:38,175 --> 01:11:42,076
Pitch 26, sort of lie back and up the
corner, key left-hand pinch thing,

1099
01:11:42,078 --> 01:11:45,647
right foot back step on the lower edge,
left foot faced against the wall, stand up.

1100
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:49,553
Left hand to the huge ear jug thing,
switch the feet, match the big jug,

1101
01:11:49,985 --> 01:11:53,487
left foot jams into the crack, then you see
right-hand down pulling on the top part of the

1102
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:57,125
jug, left hand goes into this flared slot
thing, which you can either fist jam or hand

1103
01:11:57,127 --> 01:11:59,426
jam, either way, it's like
a flare jam in the slot.

1104
01:11:59,428 --> 01:12:03,363
Sag down onto it, right hand crosses
under to an under cling, side pull.

1105
01:12:03,365 --> 01:12:06,500
Right foot sinks low to a flat edge,
left foot steps through to an edge,

1106
01:12:06,502 --> 01:12:10,237
right foot back steps really high so you
can sag your weight around the corner

1107
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,805
without having to swing.

1108
01:12:11,807 --> 01:12:14,675
Left foot out to the big horn, right
hand through to a little finger pocket,

1109
01:12:14,677 --> 01:12:17,845
you go left foot out to an edge around the
corner, you can actually push all the way

1110
01:12:17,847 --> 01:12:20,247
into the corner, then you can grab
this down pulling right hand, flat,

1111
01:12:20,249 --> 01:12:21,950
like a small crimp.

1112
01:12:21,952 --> 01:12:24,451
Left hand to the other under cling, switch
your feet on the rail and then just reach

1113
01:12:24,453 --> 01:12:26,756
through the jugs,
and then it's done.

1114
01:12:26,989 --> 01:12:31,326
The key thing for the crux, pull
hard, trust feet, "trust" underline,

1115
01:12:31,328 --> 01:12:33,594
double exclamation
point, period.

1116
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:36,466
Autopilot. Period.

1117
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:59,453
I mean, you know, it's not
surprising that Ueli died.

1118
01:12:59,455 --> 01:13:03,157
Considering he's always doing crazy
dangerous things, but I kind of thought

1119
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:05,829
he was gonna survive.

1120
01:13:07,931 --> 01:13:13,334
Ueli talked about doing sketchy climbs
that you just kind of squeak out once.

1121
01:13:13,336 --> 01:13:16,740
You know I've
always tried not to.

1122
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:19,807
But when I was talking to him
about, about Free Rider, I was like,

1123
01:13:19,809 --> 01:13:22,442
"Oh maybe Free Rider is one of those
routes that I just need to go squeak

1124
01:13:22,444 --> 01:13:25,582
out once and just like
make sure it's my day."

1125
01:13:26,182 --> 01:13:29,619
You know, obviously
it wasn't his day.

1126
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:42,330
After Ueli died, it's interesting
with Alex, how he justifies all that

1127
01:13:42,332 --> 01:13:44,635
stuff away so quickly.

1128
01:13:45,235 --> 01:13:47,468
He was just kind of like
shrugged it off, he's like

1129
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:49,907
"Oh, yeah, yeah,
it could happen."

1130
01:13:53,842 --> 01:13:56,411
I talked to Alex for a
really long time about all of this.

1131
01:13:56,413 --> 01:13:58,379
And I was like,
"What if you die?

1132
01:13:58,381 --> 01:14:01,916
Like what if you die
just like Ueli died?"

1133
01:14:01,918 --> 01:14:05,853
Ueli and his wife, Nicole, had a
really beautiful relationship and they

1134
01:14:05,855 --> 01:14:08,523
would climb together.

1135
01:14:08,525 --> 01:14:12,893
Alex said at one point,
"Well, what did she expect?"

1136
01:14:12,895 --> 01:14:16,633
And I got, I was like, "What do
you mean what did she expect?"

1137
01:14:17,467 --> 01:14:23,373
I was like, "I'm Nicole, Alex!
And I don't expect that."

1138
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:27,308
Tons of more people
have died and Alex is kind of

1139
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:32,447
the most likely to die,
but I know he's gonna do it.

1140
01:14:32,449 --> 01:14:36,220
So I'd like to be there to help
him prepare as well as he can.

1141
01:14:38,454 --> 01:14:39,689
Oh, shit.

1142
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:44,024
If he went to solo it and fell and
died, and I hadn't helped him prepare

1143
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:45,593
that would be harder for me.

1144
01:14:45,595 --> 01:14:48,630
Like, I just know that I'm, I'm one of
the people that's gonna be able to do

1145
01:14:48,632 --> 01:14:51,502
that the best with
him and so, I should.

1146
01:14:59,376 --> 01:15:03,413
He said he's feeling
tinges of, of like game time.

1147
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:07,751
I think there's a
chance he goes tomorrow.

1148
01:15:11,788 --> 01:15:15,857
They are remote cameras,
because we wanna stay out of Alex's

1149
01:15:15,859 --> 01:15:17,828
line of sight
when he's doing it.

1150
01:15:20,696 --> 01:15:23,497
Okay, everybody knows what
to do if something goes wrong.

1151
01:15:23,499 --> 01:15:26,236
Josh, just to confirm
who should Mikey call?

1152
01:15:27,636 --> 01:15:29,903
The easiest thing
would just be 911.

1153
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:33,676
And that we will get kicked into
gear and tell them what you know.

1154
01:15:34,077 --> 01:15:35,410
A climber.

1155
01:15:35,412 --> 01:15:37,344
Yeah.

1156
01:15:37,346 --> 01:15:40,416
All right, no
mistakes tomorrow.

1157
01:15:50,894 --> 01:15:54,961
I'm worried that tomorrow
is gonna be it, like, you know,

1158
01:15:54,963 --> 01:15:58,868
like Alex's existence
will be over.

1159
01:16:00,636 --> 01:16:04,604
I was like, "Oh, I have to be
prepared for that outcome and

1160
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:08,345
I have to realize that
that is a real possibility."

1161
01:16:12,782 --> 01:16:14,752
Oh, God.

1162
01:16:24,461 --> 01:16:27,894
Remember when you said you were
gonna stand up for my goodbye?

1163
01:16:27,896 --> 01:16:30,665
- Oh, is it time? -Yeah.
- Oh.

1164
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:33,604
But you don't have to stand
up, but you have to sit up.

1165
01:16:33,971 --> 01:16:37,608
Oh, you could've
just left me.

1166
01:16:39,007 --> 01:16:42,679
No, no, I'm never gonna go.

1167
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:45,912
Okay, drive safe.

1168
01:16:45,914 --> 01:16:49,552
Ciao, see you later!

1169
01:17:05,668 --> 01:17:07,902
I mean, I didn't
ask her to leave.

1170
01:17:07,904 --> 01:17:09,603
I mean, I would never
ask her to leave.

1171
01:17:09,605 --> 01:17:14,575
But, you know, I think she kind of understands
that, that it's probably easier for

1172
01:17:14,577 --> 01:17:17,748
me if she's gone.

1173
01:17:19,716 --> 01:17:22,450
I don't, I, the whole like
saying goodbye thing I'm like

1174
01:17:22,452 --> 01:17:25,519
"I'll probably see her in
like five days or something."

1175
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:28,024
It's not like goodbye, it's
just goodbye for a few days.

1176
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:37,165
You know, I mean there's just
that like weird thought of like,

1177
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:40,971
don't freaking let that be
our last hug or whatever.

1178
01:17:45,675 --> 01:17:49,645
You know, like I shouldn't
be having that thought...

1179
01:17:53,749 --> 01:17:57,387
of like "What if
something happens?

1180
01:17:57,654 --> 01:18:00,924
Like what if I don't
see him again?"

1181
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:05,526
You know, like, "Why
do you wanna do this?

1182
01:18:05,528 --> 01:18:09,032
Like it's a
totally crazy goal."

1183
01:19:43,226 --> 01:19:45,026
<i>Hey, Jimmy, do you copy?</i>

1184
01:19:45,028 --> 01:19:47,164
This is Jimmy.

1185
01:19:49,132 --> 01:19:51,602
<i>He
just started climbing.</i>

1186
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:32,139
It is so
slippery right there.

1187
01:20:32,141 --> 01:20:34,011
This is where he bailed.

1188
01:21:32,301 --> 01:21:36,136
Mikey, do you copy?
This is Jimmy.

1189
01:21:36,138 --> 01:21:38,339
<i>Hey, Jimmy, this is Mikey.</i>

1190
01:21:38,341 --> 01:21:41,745
Can you let me know when
he's through the slab pitch?

1191
01:21:42,878 --> 01:21:45,112
<i>He's through the slab pitch.</i>

1192
01:21:45,114 --> 01:21:47,247
He's through it?

1193
01:21:47,249 --> 01:21:49,886
<i>Yup,
he's almost at half dollar.</i>

1194
01:21:50,418 --> 01:21:52,823
He's moving fast.

1195
01:21:53,957 --> 01:21:58,160
<i>Yes, Jimmy,
he is of course ahead of schedule.</i>

1196
01:22:00,762 --> 01:22:02,798
So how far
is he from Mammoth?

1197
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,869
<i>Doing
the half dollar right now.</i>

1198
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:26,088
6:21 he's down climbing
to Heart Ledge there's a party,

1199
01:22:27,123 --> 01:22:29,426
in a Porter Ledge still.

1200
01:22:32,227 --> 01:22:34,998
They're awake and
there's, they're aware.

1201
01:22:35,597 --> 01:22:38,334
They're like "Here comes
Honnold." Oh, my God.

1202
01:22:39,368 --> 01:22:42,405
A Dude in a bunny suit.

1203
01:22:46,275 --> 01:22:48,142
The person is getting up now.

1204
01:22:48,144 --> 01:22:50,143
Uh yeah, no there's a tail.

1205
01:22:50,145 --> 01:22:56,285
This person has a tail and it's
either a chicken head or a bunny.

1206
01:22:56,819 --> 01:22:59,022
Oh, it's a unicorn.

1207
01:22:59,221 --> 01:23:01,358
Come on.
Who does that?

1208
01:23:02,525 --> 01:23:05,128
I've never seen
that on El Cap.

1209
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:09,263
Wow, and Alex is gone.

1210
01:23:09,265 --> 01:23:12,102
Okay, so he's entering
the Hollow Flake at 6:49.

1211
01:23:12,468 --> 01:23:16,105
He just did the Hollow Flake down
climb and is in the Hollow Flake now.

1212
01:23:21,244 --> 01:23:25,278
And then the thing about Free Rider
is that from the base of Hollow Flake

1213
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,019
it's one crack system all the way to
the top which is like what, 2,000 feet?

1214
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:35,358
That's the most magnificent
crack on planet earth.

1215
01:23:43,231 --> 01:23:44,631
<i>Doug, this is Jimmy.</i>

1216
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:48,038
<i>Do you know if they've radioed if
he's gotten to the Monster yet?</i>

1217
01:23:49,939 --> 01:23:51,775
<i>Yeah, he's there now.</i>

1218
01:24:24,574 --> 01:24:28,245
He's almost through it.

1219
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:44,491
There, he's coming
up now actually.

1220
01:24:44,493 --> 01:24:47,493
Now we see him like at
the same height as the spire.

1221
01:24:47,495 --> 01:24:50,566
But you guys are all in
position ready to go?

1222
01:24:51,434 --> 01:24:55,838
<i>Yeah, Sam and I
are at the bottom of the head wall.</i>

1223
01:24:56,338 --> 01:25:00,810
My guess is he's 15 minutes
from the Boulder Problem or so.

1224
01:26:35,037 --> 01:26:39,008
He just did
the karate kick.

1225
01:26:40,709 --> 01:26:42,511
He's got it.

1226
01:26:47,216 --> 01:26:49,084
Oh, yeah.

1227
01:26:50,653 --> 01:26:52,486
That is way too gnarly.

1228
01:26:52,488 --> 01:26:55,292
- Oh, my God.
- He did it. Jesus.

1229
01:26:57,726 --> 01:27:00,129
He just sent the
boulder problem.

1230
01:27:01,163 --> 01:27:04,167
He must be so stoked.

1231
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:07,436
I mean to have the slabs and the boulder
problem behind him is monumental.

1232
01:27:12,475 --> 01:27:16,312
- Here's the Enduro huh?
- Yup, this is the Enduro.

1233
01:27:52,681 --> 01:27:56,419
I can't believe you guys
are actually gonna watch.

1234
01:27:56,785 --> 01:28:00,422
Oh, I don't wanna, I don't,
I don't, I don't, I don't, no, no.

1235
01:28:23,479 --> 01:28:26,249
Oh, my God.

1236
01:28:34,123 --> 01:28:36,223
Yeah, that's kind
of exposed right there.

1237
01:28:36,225 --> 01:28:39,462
Oh, my God,
it's so exposed.

1238
01:28:39,761 --> 01:28:42,463
That arête move as he
stepped around has gotta be,

1239
01:28:42,465 --> 01:28:43,831
I mean that's one
of the most exposed moves

1240
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:47,600
like anywhere on El Cap.

1241
01:28:47,602 --> 01:28:50,105
If you just step out,
it all drops away.

1242
01:29:43,324 --> 01:29:45,427
Yeah, buddy.

1243
01:29:46,095 --> 01:29:49,328
Alex is having
the best day of his life.

1244
01:29:49,330 --> 01:29:52,168
I don't know. Not me.

1245
01:29:52,368 --> 01:29:56,840
I'm done, yeah, no, this is it,
I don't, we don't need to do this again.

1246
01:30:01,476 --> 01:30:02,644
Yeah, no.

1247
01:32:06,668 --> 01:32:08,971
It's over now.

1248
01:32:13,342 --> 01:32:17,946
Oh, God, it's done, woo-hoo!

1249
01:32:19,547 --> 01:32:21,014
Oh, God.

1250
01:32:21,016 --> 01:32:23,620
Oh, God, wow.

1251
01:32:24,787 --> 01:32:28,658
Oh, my God, I can't
believe what I just witnessed.

1252
01:33:07,061 --> 01:33:10,764
Oh, God.

1253
01:33:10,766 --> 01:33:13,002
Good to see
you again, yay.

1254
01:33:13,802 --> 01:33:16,639
Wow!

1255
01:33:18,974 --> 01:33:21,610
So delighted.

1256
01:33:22,144 --> 01:33:25,315
That felt so good,
it's freaking raged.

1257
01:33:26,181 --> 01:33:29,484
Like a gigantic weight
off of my shoulders too.

1258
01:33:30,119 --> 01:33:32,789
I have to admit, I mean.

1259
01:33:33,455 --> 01:33:38,394
So delighted,
what a journey.

1260
01:33:39,261 --> 01:33:44,600
Yeah, I just can't even believe
after eight years of dreaming,

1261
01:33:46,802 --> 01:33:49,803
oh San-san's calling me.

1262
01:33:49,805 --> 01:33:51,571
Hello?

1263
01:33:54,642 --> 01:33:56,276
Yeah, so delighted.

1264
01:33:56,278 --> 01:33:59,112
<i>Oh my, you're so
delighted, that's putting it lightly.</i>

1265
01:33:59,114 --> 01:34:02,148
I've like never smiled so much.
Don't say anything too.

1266
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:04,584
<i>I wanna see it.
What's that?</i>

1267
01:34:04,586 --> 01:34:06,987
<i>Like, I told you I
wanted to see that smile.</i>

1268
01:34:06,989 --> 01:34:08,755
Yeah, I know.

1269
01:34:08,757 --> 01:34:12,024
<i>I've like never cried
so hard and I didn't even see it coming.</i>

1270
01:34:12,026 --> 01:34:15,664
<i>Showing that you talk now,
I was just like "Blah."</i>

1271
01:34:16,065 --> 01:34:17,863
Yeah, no,
I'm, I'm sort of at,

1272
01:34:17,865 --> 01:34:20,770
at risk of crying here too, I'm
like, I feel quite emotional.

1273
01:34:21,337 --> 01:34:24,707
Yeah, no, don't cry
San-san it will make me cry.

1274
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:28,443
But Claire says cry it.

1275
01:34:28,709 --> 01:34:30,943
I think the movie would be better
if I burst into tears, but I,

1276
01:34:30,945 --> 01:34:32,511
I don't really want to.

1277
01:34:32,513 --> 01:34:34,613
But, well I do want
to kind of, but.

1278
01:34:34,615 --> 01:34:37,183
<i>I'm so happy.</i>

1279
01:34:37,185 --> 01:34:38,617
Oh, God.

1280
01:34:38,619 --> 01:34:40,719
<i>I'm so happy.</i>

1281
01:34:40,721 --> 01:34:42,555
Yeah.

1282
01:34:42,557 --> 01:34:45,494
<i>I'm so happy.</i>

1283
01:34:46,627 --> 01:34:47,861
Well, okay.

1284
01:34:47,863 --> 01:34:50,964
I'll see you, I'll see you in
like six hours or something.

1285
01:34:50,966 --> 01:34:53,200
<i>And
I'll see you soon, yeah.</i>

1286
01:34:53,202 --> 01:34:54,968
Yeah, okay, I love you.

1287
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:56,870
Thank you so much,
I appreciate you.

1288
01:34:56,872 --> 01:34:57,970
<i>I love you too.</i>

1289
01:34:57,972 --> 01:34:59,539
You're, you're the best.

1290
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:01,140
<i>And I appreciate
you and I'm really proud of you.</i>

1291
01:35:01,142 --> 01:35:02,712
Yay.

1292
01:35:04,145 --> 01:35:05,478
I don't know.

1293
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,979
I don't, I don't think the mountain
looked that scary this morning.

1294
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:10,116
It's funny because it does look the
same and hiking up looked the same,

1295
01:35:10,118 --> 01:35:12,251
everything just felt pretty much
the same, except I just didn't have

1296
01:35:12,253 --> 01:35:14,688
much of a backpack.

1297
01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:16,889
I did, I forgot
my rope and rack.

1298
01:35:16,891 --> 01:35:18,492
I felt so good.

1299
01:35:18,494 --> 01:35:20,993
I mean that's why I'm so happy that the
experience was like what I hoped for.

1300
01:35:20,995 --> 01:35:23,563
I didn't compromise on any of the
things that were super important to me.

1301
01:35:23,565 --> 01:35:25,935
Huh, yeah, that felt good.

1302
01:35:26,702 --> 01:35:28,501
All right.

1303
01:35:28,503 --> 01:35:30,939
So what's next, what
are you gonna do Alex?

1304
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:32,706
Mmm, I'm probably
gonna hang board.

1305
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:34,177
You're gonna hang board?

1306
01:35:34,843 --> 01:35:37,946
A normal person would probably
take the afternoon off.

1307
01:35:49,525 --> 01:35:51,558
Thanks again for
coming out and climbing with me.

1308
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:52,893
<i>I'm really proud of you.</i>

1309
01:35:52,895 --> 01:35:55,097
<i>Good work not plummeting
to your death.</i>

1310
01:35:55,897 --> 01:35:57,667
<i>Really glad it's over.</i>

1311
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:02,772
Oh, my gosh,
you're here, oh, my God!

1312
01:36:04,873 --> 01:36:08,878
Oh, my gosh, I'm so happy
for you, you did it and you're done.

1313
01:36:10,846 --> 01:36:12,912
You know some of the people
that have come before you,

1314
01:36:12,914 --> 01:36:15,581
they, they didn't quit
while they were ahead.

1315
01:36:15,583 --> 01:36:16,983
Maybe it's good.

1316
01:36:16,985 --> 01:36:19,589
Maybe I don't need to
keep charging ahead.

1317
01:36:20,088 --> 01:36:23,089
Right now there's some kid that just read
about El Cap being soloed and he's like.

1318
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:24,590
"What's bigger?"

1319
01:36:24,592 --> 01:36:26,125
Like "What's cooler?"

1320
01:36:26,127 --> 01:36:28,929
And I mean somebody's gonna think of
something and it's gonna be cooler.

1321
01:36:28,931 --> 01:36:33,102
But I don't know if that will be me.
Maybe, I don't know.

1322
