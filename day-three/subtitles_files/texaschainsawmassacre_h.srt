1
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,711
...to give further details
of the case.

2
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,083
It is believed that
the indictment

3
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,926
is only one of a series

4
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,511
to be handed down as a result

5
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,723
of a special grand jury
investigation.

6
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,014
Grave robbing in Texas
is this hour's top news story.

7
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,386
An informant led officers

8
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,433
of the Muerto County
Sheriff's Department

9
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,729
to a cemetery just outside
the small rural Texas community

10
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,522
of Newt early this morning.

11
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,612
Officers there discovered
what appeared to be

12
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,196
a grisly work of art,

13
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,817
the remains of a badly
decomposed body

14
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,909
wired to a large monument.

15
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,779
A second body was
found in a ditch

16
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,997
near the perimeter
of the cemetery.

17
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,866
Subsequent investigation
has revealed

18
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,039
at least a dozen empty crypts,

19
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,414
and it's feared more will turn
up as the probe continues.

20
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,711
Deputies report that
in some instances

21
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,210
only parts of a corpse
had been removed;

22
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,008
the head or in some cases
the extremities removed,

23
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,507
the remainder of the
corpse left intact.

24
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,554
Evidence indicates the
robberies have occurred

25
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,428
over a period of time.

26
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,224
Sheriff Jesus Maldonado

27
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,644
refused to give details
of the ghoulish case

28
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,143
and said only that
he did have strong evidence

29
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,270
linking the crime to elements
outside the state.

30
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,445
Area residents have reportedly
converged on the cemetery,

31
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,614
fearing the remains of relatives
have been removed.

32
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,282
No suspects are in custody

33
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,907
as the investigation
at the scene continues.

34
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,668
Oil storage units continue
to burn out of control

35
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,881
at the huge Texaco refinery
near the Texas-Louisiana border.

36
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,625
Three storage units exploded
into flames during the night

37
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,174
killing at least three workers
and injuring a dozen more.

38
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,388
Fire fighting units from
three Texas cities

39
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,007
continue to battle the blaze

40
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,886
in an effort to confine
40 foot flames.

41
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,353
Smoke from the fire
has reached Houston residents

42
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,894
some 60 miles to the south.

43
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,609
Health officials from
San Francisco reluctantly admit

44
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,275
they may have a cholera epidemic
on their hands.

45
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,195
Some 40 cases of the
highly infectious disease

46
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,067
have been confirmed...

47
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,744
Huston police are puzzled
over an outbreak of violence

48
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,417
apparently touched off
by a suicide.

49
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,758
A young man reportedly angered
by a local television blackout

50
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:21,921
of a sports event,

51
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,590
jumped from the 10th story
window of his apartment.

52
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,886
A second man who allegedly
threatened to leap to his death

53
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,181
from the same window
but was restrained by police.

54
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,680
Witnesses to the incident
reported...

55
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,948
...Was taken into custody.

56
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,488
She offered no explanation
for the attack.

57
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,407
The Lieutenant was treated
for minor wounds at

58
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,452
Ben Taub Hospital and released.

59
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,498
A 16 story building under
construction in downtown Atlanta

60
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,964
collapsed today killing
at least 29 persons.

61
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,832
The engineering firm responsible

62
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,879
for the structural design
of the building

63
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,879
could offer no explanation
of the collapse.

64
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,177
The local construction crew say

65
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,095
there was no logical reason
for the collapse

66
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,515
and suspect sabotage.

67
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,889
Police in Gary, Indiana have
been unable to identify

68
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,265
the bodies of a young man

69
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,358
and woman discovered
by children...

70
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,150
...Stab wounds
and their features carved away.

71
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,242
The man's genitals
had been removed

72
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,909
and the police first identified
the victims as two women.

73
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,036
Just stay right there.

74
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,137
You okay?

75
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,956
Franklin!

76
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,215
Ah!

77
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,088
Ah!

78
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,675
You okay?

79
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,048
I was...

80
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,470
Shit.

81
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,098
Okay...

82
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,563
This heat is
just driving me crazy.

83
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,978
I don't know if I can
take much more.

84
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,692
Listen,
"The condition of retrogradation

85
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,812
is contrary or inharmonious
to the regular direction

86
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,155
of actual movement in the zodiac

87
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,992
and is, in that respect, evil.

88
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,862
Hence, when malefic planets
are in retrograde."

89
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,739
And Saturn's malefic, okay.

90
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,412
"Their maleficence
is increased."

91
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,875
Have you been doing
those Reader's Digest

92
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:01,914
word power columns again?

93
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,379
Jerry, it just means that
Saturn's a bad influence.

94
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,544
It's just particularly
a bad influence now

95
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,792
because it's in retrograde.

96
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,090
Hey, man,
you believe all that stuff

97
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,427
your old lady's hawkin' me?

98
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,341
I don't know.

99
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,403
My granddaddy's buried here.

100
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,401
Could we find out if anything
happened to him?

101
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,572
What's your granddaddy's name?

102
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,116
Honey, that big heavy feller

103
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,955
that's standing with that
flashlight in his hand,

104
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,791
that's the Sheriff.

105
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,707
You go tell him your
granddaddy's buried in there.

106
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,828
- Okay.
- He'll let you in.

107
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:45,750
Thank you.

108
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,293
Say, fella, I'm going to run off
with your girl a minute.

109
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,335
You don't mind do you?

110
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,924
Honey, I'll get you to
the Sheriff. Come on.

111
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:50,758
Hey, folks,
let us through here,

112
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,673
this girl's granddaddy's
buried here.

113
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,011
Been in there the whole time,
unbeknownst to Clyde.

114
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,349
Clyde didn't know either.
They didn't know why...

115
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,432
Things happen hereabout

116
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,146
they don't tell about.

117
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,518
I see things.

118
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,313
You see,

119
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,910
they say it's
just an old man talking.

120
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,281
You laugh at an old man.

121
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:24,035
There's them that laughs
and knows better.

122
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,751
Yes, they're sure.

123
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,925
The man said they could tell
if the grave had been dug up.

124
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,468
Franklin, don't worry,

125
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,056
I saw it myself.

126
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,675
It didn't look dug up to me.

127
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,852
Oh, what's that?

128
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,441
What smells?

129
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,275
What is that stench?

130
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,943
Roll up the window.

131
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,114
Hey...

132
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,203
that's the old slaughterhouse.

133
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,789
That's where grandpa
used to sell his cattle.

134
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,329
Hey, we got an uncle

135
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,749
that works at one of those
places outside of Ft. Worth.

136
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,122
Hey, you see those
buildings there?

137
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,669
That's where they kill them.

138
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,667
They bash them in the head
with a big sledgehammer.

139
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,168
Oh, that's awful.

140
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,546
It usually wouldn't kill "em
on the first lick.

141
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,148
I mean, they'd start squealing
and freaking out and everything,

142
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,366
and they'd have to come up
and bash 'em two or three times.

143
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,701
And then sometimes
it wouldn't kill them.

144
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,944
I mean,
they would skin them sometimes

145
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,287
even before they were even dead.

146
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,246
Oh, that's horrible.

147
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,116
People shouldn't kill
animals for food.

148
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,959
Well, they don't do it
like that anymore.

149
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,453
Now they got this big air gun

150
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,547
that shoots a bolt into their
skull and then retracts it.

151
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,915
It's just boom!

152
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,292
It goes boom!
And boom!

153
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,216
Franklin, I like meat.
Please change the subject.

154
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,056
That's terrible but
it's still going on.

155
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,265
Oh, man, it's hot in here.

156
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,152
Hitchhiker.

157
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,985
Should we pick him up?

158
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,527
Oh, yeah, man, pick him up,
he'll asphyxiate out there.

159
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,444
What does he look like?

160
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,657
The son of a bitch
is going to smell

161
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,117
just like the slaughterhouse.

162
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,284
Oh, give the guy a break.
He can sit by Franklin.

163
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,246
What do you want to do?

164
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,241
- Oh, he's weird looking.
- Pick him up, man.

165
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,208
No!

166
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,729
Well, I think we
just picked up Dracula.

167
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,940
Where you headed, man?

168
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:52,557
South.

169
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,276
You work at that place?

170
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,315
Oh, no.

171
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,563
How did you get
stuck way out here?

172
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,907
I was at the slaughterhouse.

173
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,696
I got an uncle that works
at a slaughterhouse.

174
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,820
Hey, my, my
brother worked there.

175
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,993
My, my grandfather, too.

176
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,496
My family's always been in meat.

177
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,125
A whole family of Dracula's.

178
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,713
Hey, man, did you go in
that slaughter room

179
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,082
or whatever they call it?

180
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,629
The place where they shoot
the cattle in the head

181
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,092
with that big air gun thing?

182
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,588
Oh, that,
that...that gun's no good.

183
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,510
I was in there once
with my uncle.

184
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,885
The old way...with a sledge!

185
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,307
See, that was better.

186
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,180
They died better that way.

187
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,182
How come?
I thought the gun was better?

188
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,400
Oh, no, no.

189
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,896
With the new way,
people are put out of jobs.

190
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,318
You do that?

191
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:41,941
Look.

192
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,831
I was the killer!

193
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,494
Damn.

194
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,958
Let me see them.

195
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,043
They don't send the heads away.

196
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,003
You took these, huh?

197
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,292
Yeah.

198
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,789
Franklin!

199
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,928
See, they make...head cheese.

200
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,094
They...

201
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,344
they take the head
and they boil it,

202
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,015
except for the tongue,

203
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,685
and they scrape all the flesh
away from the bone.

204
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,684
They, they use everything,
they don't throw nothing way.

205
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,279
They use the jowls
and the muscles

206
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,944
and the eyes and the
ligaments and everything.

207
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,784
- Oh.
- Look at this.

208
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:26,868
The nose and the gums

209
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,782
and all the flesh
and they boil it down

210
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,622
into a big jelly of fat.

211
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,287
Wow, I didn't know that's
what was in that stuff.

212
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,160
It's really good.

213
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,582
You like it?

214
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,580
Oh, yeah, sure, I like it,

215
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,626
it's good.

216
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,339
Oh, it sounds horrible.

217
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,880
Is it possible we could
talk about something else?

218
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,002
Oh, you'd probably like it

219
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,469
if you didn't know
what was in it.

220
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,306
No, I wouldn't and I wish
you'd stop talking about it.

221
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,640
Oh.

222
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,181
Come on, Franklin,
you're making everybody sick.

223
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,428
Oh, all right.

224
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,328
What are you doing?

225
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,409
Hey, man, put that knife up.

226
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,251
Oh, come on.

227
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,549
Oh!

228
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,594
Oh, what are you doing
to yourself?

229
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,510
Oh, my God!
Why are you doing that?

230
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,237
Put the knife away.

231
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,669
I...I have this knife.

232
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,714
You can put that one away too.

233
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,721
It's a good knife.

234
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,639
I'm sure it is, man.

235
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,012
Put it up.

236
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,022
Hey, you took my picture.

237
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,650
Hey, you, you could
take me to my house.

238
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,146
I live right off this road.

239
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,692
Well, I don't know, man,

240
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,112
we're in pretty much of a hurry.

241
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,610
How close is it?

242
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,531
It's real close.

243
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:19,500
Well, couldn't you just walk?
I mean, if it's so close...

244
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,335
You could have dinner with us.

245
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,045
You like head cheese?

246
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,335
My brother makes it real good.
You'll like it.

247
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,458
I think we better push on, man,

248
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,880
don't you, Jerry?

249
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,503
Yeah, I'm sorry.

250
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,571
It didn't turn out so good.

251
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,573
It's a nice picture.

252
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,450
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?

253
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,792
Two dollars.

254
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,536
It's a good picture.

255
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,332
No, man.

256
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,706
Franklin, give him back
the damn picture.

257
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,171
He wanted Franklin
to pay him for that picture.

258
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,715
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm serious.

259
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,667
What are you doing?

260
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,973
Hey, Jerry, pull us over!

261
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,346
Hey, man, what is that?.
What are you doing?

262
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,436
Hey man,
what are you doing?

263
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,549
Ah, oh, my God!

264
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,518
Oh, I'm about half-ready
to call a cop.

265
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,638
That's the last goddamn
hitchhiker I ever pick up.

266
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,030
Hey, listen to Franklin's
horoscope.

267
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,900
Oh, Sally...

268
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,618
“Travel in the country,

269
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,487
long-range plans,

270
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,785
and upsetting persons around you

271
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,002
could make this a disturbing
and unpredictable day.

272
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,497
The events in the world
are not doing much either

273
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,498
to cheer one up."

274
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,092
That's just perfect.

275
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,551
Franklin,
I think that'll be all right.

276
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,170
And now read Sally's.

277
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,797
- She's a Capricorn.
- Okay.

278
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,310
Oh, no.

279
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,480
Capricorn's ruled by Saturn.

280
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,816
"There are moments when
we cannot believe

281
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,280
that what is happening
is really true.

282
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,242
Pinch yourself and
you may find out that it is."

283
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,516
Okay, everybody out.

284
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,272
Hurry up so we can get goin'.

285
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,278
Here comes somebody.

286
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,543
How are you?

287
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,789
Would you fill her up, please?

288
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,293
I got no gas.

289
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,591
You're out of gas?

290
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,213
My tank's empty.

291
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,718
The transport won't be here
until late this afternoon,

292
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,220
maybe not even until
tomorrow morning.

293
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,437
I told you we should've
stopped to get gas.

294
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,432
Hey, do you know where the
old Franklin place is?

295
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,947
The old Franklin place?

296
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,941
Yeah, it's an old
two-story rock house

297
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,238
and it's sitting up on a hill.

298
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,986
I think you have to turn on
that road back there

299
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,738
but I'm not real sure.

300
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,872
Yeah,

301
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,164
maybe I seen something
like that up that way.

302
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,879
Well, now look,
you boys don't want to go

303
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,294
messin' around no old house.

304
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,340
Well, those things is dangerous.
You're liable to get hurt.

305
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,961
We'll be careful.

306
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:27,636
You don't want to go fooling
around other folks property.

307
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,806
Some folks don't like it
and they don't mind showing you.

308
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,599
Oh, my father owns it.

309
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,473
That's your Daddy's place, huh?

310
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,564
Yeah.

311
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,401
Look, I got some good
barbeque here.

312
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,612
Why don't you fellas stick
around here awhile?

313
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,278
That transport will be
by in a little while.

314
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,699
Well, you want to get
some barbeque?

315
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,073
Them...them girls, now they,

316
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,042
they don't want to go messing
around no old house.

317
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,037
It's best you stick around here.

318
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:09,716
You know, we should've asked him

319
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,889
if there's another
gas station around.

320
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,183
Don't you think he would've
told us if there was?

321
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,103
Man, it wouldn't
hurt to ask, you know?

322
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,067
Okay, I'll go ask.

323
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,196
Damn it to hell, we should've
stopped back there for gas.

324
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,614
- Press it.
- I'm pulling it down.

325
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:29,702
Press it.

326
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,285
There.

327
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,746
Hey, you think this place
has room service?

328
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,498
Franklin, you maniac,
you're tearing up the van.

329
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:42,590
Oh, yeah,
I just started doing that.

330
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,389
Hey, I bet that's
some of that guy's blood.

331
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,888
Look at that.
Look at that.

332
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,510
You think that's blood?

333
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,137
Yeah, I guess so.

334
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,020
Oh, that's blood all right.

335
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,484
And that guy cut the hell
out of himself.

336
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,902
You think you could do
that to yourself?

337
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,820
I'm not crazy.

338
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,864
Yeah, but you know...

339
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,236
It takes something, though.

340
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,990
I mean, just to do that to
yourself like he did.

341
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,490
God!

342
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,580
Hey, you think I said
something made him mad?

343
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,006
Well, what?

344
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,627
Franklin,
you're crazier than he was.

345
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,431
Hey, I got us some barbeque.

346
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,892
Newt's the closest place
to get gas.

347
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,385
Aw.

348
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:42,938
We're going out to
Grandpa's place, aren't we?

349
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,605
Let's go.

350
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,819
Well, there's a creek,
you could go swimming.

351
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,234
- Let's go.
- Come on.

352
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,448
Come on, Sally, we're going
out to Grandpa's place.

353
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,817
Let's go.

354
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,742
Hey, that guy smeared blood
all over the van.

355
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,699
It looks like he was trying
to write something.

356
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,701
What?
What'd he do?

357
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,373
Did he write something
on the van?

358
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,018
Let me see your knife.

359
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,398
Thank you.

360
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,239
Franklin, if we run out of gas

361
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,332
before we get back to
that service station

362
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,247
you're towing us
back in your chair.

363
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,384
Hey,

364
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,632
you think that guy's just
trying to scare us by,

365
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,010
you know, blowing up
my picture like that?

366
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,601
Aw, I wish they hadn't let
the place fall apart.

367
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,319
It looks like the birthplace
of Bela Lugosi.

368
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,316
- Hey, I'm scared.
- I'll help you with that.

369
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,068
See that window over there...?

370
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,201
Hey, watch my arms,
watch my arms.

371
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,998
Watch my arm. Watch out.
Go straight.

372
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,087
- Come on down.
- You got it?

373
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,081
- Hey.
- I'll get you from here.

374
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,709
I don't see that,
that smear that guy made.

375
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,431
- Oh, man.
- Now, that's weird.

376
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,894
I wonder if that
means something.

377
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,980
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's going to get you.

378
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,894
- Jerry, come on.
- Kirk, why don't you wash it off, okay?

379
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,813
I want to show you the inside.

380
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,899
- Jerry!
- Okay.

381
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,615
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

382
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,701
- Wait a minute.
- Come on, Kirk.

383
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,820
Here, man, you wash it off.

384
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,321
Hey, you don't think that guy

385
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,074
would try and follow us,
do you?

386
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,290
What for?

387
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,429
Where's my knife?

388
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,593
Kirk?

389
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,597
It looks like it must've been a
nursery room or something.

390
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,516
- Oh, this is great.
- Oh, this is my room.

391
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,060
I got to stay here once
when I was eight years old.

392
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,683
Right after my
grandmother died.

393
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,900
What happened?

394
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,315
What happened to
my grandmother?

395
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,358
Yeah. She died.

396
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,019
What do you think of
the wallpaper?

397
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,607
I think it's seen some
better days, personally.

398
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,602
No, these animals used
to talk me to sleep

399
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,398
when I was little kid.

400
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,987
- Look at the zebras, see?
- Uh-huh.

401
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,027
I had these fascination
for the zebras.

402
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,779
Sally!

403
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,896
Sally!

404
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,740
Hee, hee, hee, hee,
hee, hee, hee, hee.

405
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,414
Hee, hee, hee, hee.

406
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,546
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.

407
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:42,127
“Come on, Franklin.
It's gonna be a fun trip.”

408
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,603
If I have any more fun today,

409
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,189
I don't think I'm going
to be able to take it.

410
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,688
Ah!
Ow, that hurt!

411
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,363
Oh.

412
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,701
Hey, Franklin.

413
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,623
Hey, Franklin, how's your arm?

414
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,961
Didn't you say there was a
swimming hole around here?

415
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,254
Yeah.

416
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,878
Well, Pam and I would like
to go swimming, man.

417
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,635
There used to be a trail down
between those two old sheds.

418
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,353
Come on, we'll find it.

419
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,604
Are Jerry and Sally going?

420
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,898
No. We'll see you
in an hour or so.

421
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,023
Yeah...

422
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,150
We'll see you
in about an hour or so.

423
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,426
Sally?

424
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:12,595
Sally--

425
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,269
Sally!

426
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,906
...Zero in the world.

427
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,580
Just shoot him and put us
out of our misery.

428
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,829
There's snakes!

429
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:39,997
- There's spiders!
- Stop it!

430
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,712
There's scorpions!

431
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,547
Man-eating lizards!

432
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,795
Kirk, help.

433
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,762
- Kirk!
- Ow.

434
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,177
- Ow.
- Oh.

435
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:54,967
Crap.

436
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,514
This must be it.

437
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,312
Oh, are you okay?

438
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,438
How the hell did Franklin
ever get down here anyway?

439
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,737
Somebody must've carried him
when he was little.

440
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,110
Franklin never was little.

441
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,292
Gasoline!

442
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,003
I can leave them my guitar,

443
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,796
you know,
give 'em a couple bucks.

444
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,419
We got to come back
by here anyway,

445
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,922
I can pick up my guitar and
give him a couple more dollars

446
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:33,968
and bring him back some gas.

447
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,466
They don't want your guitar.

448
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,184
They're not going to want
to sell us some gas.

449
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,643
Let's just go back now.

450
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,854
Hey, come here.

451
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,273
Come here and look at this.

452
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,502
A generator.

453
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,502
What?

454
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,844
A generator.

455
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,680
For electricity.

456
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,136
Hey, hello in there!
Is anybody here?

457
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,853
Hello, is anybody home?

458
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,122
I got something for you.

459
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,844
Ah!

460
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,805
Oh.

461
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,515
Let's go!

462
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,432
Hello?

463
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,939
Hello?!

464
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:37,982
Hello?

465
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,068
Hey, Pam, come look at this.

466
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,786
Let's go!

467
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,787
Hello?

468
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,080
Is anybody home?

469
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,049
Hello?

470
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,686
Hey, Pam...

471
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,654
Hello?

472
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:42,838
Kirk?

473
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,061
Kirk?

474
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,162
Kirk?

475
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,665
Kirk?

476
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:43,782
Kirk?

477
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,779
Kirk?

478
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,172
Kirk?

479
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,071
Oh, God!

480
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,749
Kirk!

481
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,668
He's going to get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you.

482
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,416
You don't think it
means anything?

483
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,463
We'll protect you
if he tries to get you.

484
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,970
I'll bet it's about me.

485
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,554
He's going to kill you,
Franklin.

486
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,010
It probably doesn't mean
anything, huh?

487
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,432
You worry too much.

488
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,223
Well, he couldn't
find us anyway.

489
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,021
I mean,
he doesn't even know our names.

490
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,645
I gave him your name, Franklin.
I told him where you live.

491
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,442
I even gave him your zip code.

492
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,314
He's going to kill you.

493
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,690
Jerry.

494
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,822
What are you doing?

495
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,366
I can't find my knife.

496
00:40:58,498 --> 00:40:59,613
That knife won't
do you any good.

497
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,740
He likes that knife, remember?

498
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,458
When did you have it last?

499
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,587
Well, I didn't have it last.

500
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,876
You had it last.

501
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,544
I gave it to you, remember?

502
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:11,508
What did you do with it?

503
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,003
Well, I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?

504
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,176
No, I didn't have it
when I got out of the van.

505
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,594
You just never gave it
back to me.

506
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,216
All right, I'll look for it.

507
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,553
Listen, I think I'll
walk down to the creek

508
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,930
before it gets too dark.

509
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,602
How do I get there, Franklin?

510
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,068
Well, there's a trail down there
between them two old sheds.

511
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,190
Can I go, too?

512
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,189
I think you better stay here.

513
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,532
All right.

514
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,872
I can't find it.

515
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:55,794
Are you mad at me?

516
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,052
No, I'm not mad at you.

517
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,477
You really are mad, huh?

518
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,853
Oh, I don't blame you.

519
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:09,941
I'm

520
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,525
Kirk!

521
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:25,074
You really didn't want me
to come, did you?

522
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,165
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.

523
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,208
It's been a long day.

524
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,923
Sally, did you believe
in all that stuff

525
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:41,174
that Pam was telling about
Saturn and retrograde

526
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,925
and all that?

527
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,768
I don't know.

528
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,263
Everything means something,
I guess.

529
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,308
Yeah.

530
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,937
You don't think that guy
would try and follow us, do you?

531
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,862
Well, I mean, there's no way
that he could follow us.

532
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,113
He's probably afraid
Kirk will kill him.

533
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,751
Sally?

534
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,590
What now?

535
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,886
Oh, nothing.

536
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,259
Never mind.

537
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,015
Kirk!

538
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,425
Hello?

539
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,260
Is anybody home?

540
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,313
Excuse me,
I'm looking for some friends.

541
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,651
Hello?

542
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,530
Is anybody here?

543
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,032
Damn...

544
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,133
Kirk?

545
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,226
Are you guys in there?

546
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,724
Hey, guys, quit playing games.

547
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,067
Quit goofing on me.

548
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,328
Pam, is that you?

549
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,001
Okay, you guys.

550
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,832
Come on out.

551
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,424
Come on!

552
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,266
Kirk?

553
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,421
Ooh!

554
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,804
They must be lost.

555
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,847
They don't have a flashlight
or anything.

556
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,143
If they're not back in a minute
we've got to go look for them.

557
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,733
Well, well,
what if we get lost, too?

558
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,321
Sally, we ought to go to that
gas station and get help.

559
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,816
I'm not leaving here
without Jerry.

560
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,952
Jerry!

561
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,581
Jerry!

562
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,833
Jerry!

563
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,921
Jerry!

564
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,300
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

565
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:11,423
Hey!

566
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,305
They'll probably be back
in a minute or so.

567
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,022
Sally, we ought to go
to that gas station.

568
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:27,689
Sally?

569
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,322
I think we ought to go.

570
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,819
Are the keys in the van?

571
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:41,783
Could I see the flashlight
for a minute?

572
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,035
What for?

573
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,502
Franklin,
let me see the flashlight.

574
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,747
I'm gonna to go look for them.
You don't have to go.

575
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:48,839
Now, Sally, don't go.

576
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,629
I don't think that's a
good idea, Sally.

577
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,251
I don't think you ought to go.

578
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,926
Look, I'm going to honk
the horn one more time.

579
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,594
Just give me the flashlight!

580
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:58,887
No, now, I'm...

581
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,760
I'm going to honk the horn

582
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,432
and we're going to wait
a minute,

583
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,727
and then if they don't come,
well, we'll go.

584
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:06,315
All right?

585
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,528
Sally, they took the keys.

586
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,526
- We don't have any keys.
- Oh.

587
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,152
They took the keys with them.

588
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:20,621
Stop it!

589
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,115
Stop it!

590
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,374
Stop it! Franklin!

591
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,244
- Jerry took the keys with him.
- Give me that flashlight!

592
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,087
No, Sally, we can't go!

593
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,707
Look, what if they came
back and we weren't here?

594
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,709
Franklin,
give me that flashlight!

595
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:34,381
No, I've got to take
the flashlight.

596
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,924
- All right, all right.
- I'm going to go look for them.

597
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,171
Give me that flashlight!

598
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,219
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you, all right?

599
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,262
No, Sally, come on,
I'll go with you.

600
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,100
Sally, I'll go with you

601
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,344
but I'm going to
keep the flashlight.

602
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,767
Give me the flashlight!

603
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:46,515
Look, look, I'll go with you,
I'll go with you.

604
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,438
I can't push you down that hill!

605
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,901
Sally, look, I know.

606
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,191
Oh!

607
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,027
Look, I'll go with you
but I'm going to hold--

608
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,526
Never mind,
I'll just go without it.

609
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,953
All right, all right.
Sally, wait!

610
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,163
Sally, wait a minute!
I'm coming with you.

611
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,499
Sally?

612
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:06,959
Hold up a minute now.

613
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:08,961
All right, let's go.

614
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,289
Let's go.
I'll go with you.

615
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,797
Sally, I can't keep up with you.

616
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:16,920
Sally?

617
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,597
Sally, wait a minute.

618
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,680
Hold up.

619
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,576
Jerry!

620
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,119
Jerry!

621
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,583
Jerry!

622
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,295
Jerry!

623
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,003
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

624
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,017
Wait.

625
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,971
I thought I heard something.

626
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,815
There's a light.

627
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,230
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

628
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,771
Oh.

629
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,443
It looks like a house.

630
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,283
Well, come on, push.

631
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,901
Come on, push.

632
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,653
Push down. There.

633
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:31,585
It's a house.

634
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:34,206
Yeah?
I can't see it very well.

635
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,675
Oh, Franklin,
this is impossible.

636
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:38,793
Come on, Sally.

637
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,675
Get back and push down.

638
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,133
This is impossible...

639
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,475
I hear something out there.

640
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,232
Look!

641
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,988
Hey, Jerry!

642
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,278
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

643
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,741
Sally, I hear something.
Stop.

644
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:11,413
Stop!

645
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,753
Somebody please!

646
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,793
Help!

647
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,925
Help me please!

648
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,048
Help me! Help me!

649
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,783
Help!

650
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:08,302
Help!

651
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,388
Please! Please!
Please help me!

652
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:12,222
Please.

653
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,333
Help!

654
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,577
Help me!

655
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,703
Help!

656
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,040
Help!

657
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,510
Help! Help!

658
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,306
Help me!

659
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:03,136
Oh God help, help!

660
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,181
Close the door.

661
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,691
Whoa there, whoa, whoa.

662
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:09,729
Whoa, whoa,
come over here. Whoa, whoa.

663
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,602
...Trying to kill me.

664
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,613
Help me

665
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,108
Whoa, now.
You're all right, you're okay.

666
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,702
- Oh now, take it easy.
- Call the police.

667
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,116
He might come...

668
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:21,988
Now what happened?

669
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:24,616
He, he killed...

670
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,116
Now, now, take it easy.

671
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,368
He killed Franklin.

672
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,245
I don't know.
Call the police!

673
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:31,088
Take it easy.

674
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,127
And Jerry...

675
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,922
I, I don't, I don't know
what happened to the others.

676
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,965
There's nobody out there now.

677
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:38,803
Come on.

678
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,388
Come on now, take it easy.

679
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,723
Come on, take it easy.

680
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:42,683
Oh, please...

681
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:44,267
What happened?

682
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:47,639
Please, call the police.

683
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,391
There's no phone here.

684
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:55,442
We...we have to, we have to
drive over to Childress

685
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:56,814
Yeah, yeah.

686
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,156
Now, you take it easy.

687
00:58:58,285 --> 00:58:59,650
Take it easy.

688
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,197
I'll get the truck.

689
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,865
Now, now, take it easy.

690
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:04,363
- Take it easy.
- Don't go.

691
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,864
- Take it easy.
- Don't go...

692
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,416
Area weather is expected

693
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,589
to continue warm
and clear to party cloudy

694
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,382
for tomorrow with no
chance of precipitation

695
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,629
in the immediate forecast

696
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:22,507
The high today is going
to be in the upper nineties.

697
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,303
Expect a low tonight
of 81 degrees.

698
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,972
Our current temperature is 96

699
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,471
with winds out of the southeast
at three miles a hour.

700
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:32,191
Humidity 98,
barometer at 29.9 and rising.

701
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,777
Acting on a tip from
Clyde Haywood of Newt,

702
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,361
the Muerto County
Sheriff's office

703
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,356
began an investigation
early this morning

704
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,449
in the Muerto County Cemetery,

705
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,067
opening crypts and mausoleums

706
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,865
where there was evidence
of tampering.

707
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,580
The Sheriff's deputies have
found a reported dozen coffins

708
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,665
robbed of all or part
of their contents.

709
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:51,832
According to Sheriff Jesus
Maldonado there was instances

710
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,455
in which only the heads
and extremities were removed

711
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,083
and others in which only a hand
or foot had been removed,

712
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,426
with the remainder
of the cadaver left intact.

713
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,136
Maldonado had hinted
that he had information

714
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,177
linking the robberies
to a large and well organized

715
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,391
west coast jewel theft ring.

716
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,760
He declined to suggest
any reason

717
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,478
for them to mutilate
the cadavers...

718
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,460
What are you doing?

719
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,828
Now, you ain't got
no need to worry.

720
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:35,921
No!

721
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,460
Now, now,
you just cooperate, young lady,

722
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:38,957
and we'll have no trouble.

723
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,214
Now, listen, this is...

724
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,508
What do you want?

725
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,803
Now, there's,
no need to do that.

726
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:49,267
Nobody's going to hurt you.

727
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:50,886
No!

728
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,556
Had to lock up
and get the lights.

729
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:00,728
Cost of electricity

730
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,692
is enough to drive a man
out of business.

731
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,889
I hope you're not too
uncomfortable down there.

732
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,016
You got nothing to worry about.

733
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:47,488
You, you just take it easy
and we'll, we'll be there soon.

734
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:54,495
Now, now, now, now.

735
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,613
There's no,
no need to do that, no.

736
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,444
We'll, we'll
be over this in a bit.

737
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:29,863
Hang on.

738
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,165
Half-wits.

739
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,461
Little coon shits...

740
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,884
Come here,
you nap-haired idiot!

741
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,265
Where have you been?

742
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,809
I've been out on the road.

743
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:03,521
You damn fool,

744
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,732
you almost got caught
over at Newt.

745
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,727
No, no, they didn't see me.

746
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,024
They don't know nothing.

747
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:13,114
I told you to stay away
from that graveyard.

748
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:29,797
Hey.

749
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,949
I told you and I told you,

750
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:59,411
I told you never to leave
your brother alone, you...

751
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:02,247
Get, get at her and get
that girl out of the car.

752
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,366
Get her, get her out of the car.

753
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,288
Get her out of there.

754
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,496
Hopefully your brother

755
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,623
didn't let any of
those kids get away.

756
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:12,624
Get her in there.

757
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,842
We'll have the whole
county out here.

758
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,587
Don't you got any self-respect?

759
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,850
Look what your brother
did to the door!

760
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:26,021
Don't he got no,
no pride in his home?

761
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:26,934
Get her in there.

762
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,985
You damn, fool, you!

763
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,986
You better get
those damn other kids.

764
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,532
Where, where are they, huh?

765
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,718
You goddamn fool, you!

766
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,141
Oh!

767
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,556
I thought you was in a hurry!

768
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,437
Now, where are the kids?

769
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:12,650
Where are they? Show me!

770
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:18,816
None of "em get away?

771
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,989
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

772
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,326
Are you sure?

773
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,616
Uh-huh.

774
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,502
You...

775
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,496
You damn fool,

776
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,339
you ruined the door!

777
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:45,300
Hey, you did good.

778
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,141
She's a nice girl.

779
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:47,477
You nit-wit.

780
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,892
Get upstairs
and get your Grandpa.

781
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,990
Now, young lady, you just,

782
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,743
you just take it easy
there, now.

783
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:13,870
Look, we'll, we'll fix you
some supper in a few minutes.

784
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:19,467
Get back in there!

785
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,048
Get in there!

786
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,514
Now, you just take it easy.

787
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,140
Take it easy.

788
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,523
We'll have you something
to eat right away.

789
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:05,464
Hey!

790
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:08,679
Hey, Leatherface!

791
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,552
Give me a hand with Grandpa.

792
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,032
Careful.

793
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,199
Don't drop him.

794
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:49,095
Help me.

795
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,318
Look, Grandpa, look! Look!

796
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:37,564
Here, here!

797
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,458
Shut up!

798
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,252
Quiet!

799
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:29,672
You act like a pack of hounds.

800
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:32,091
We were just having fun.

801
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:34,806
You think this is a party?

802
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:36,390
Please...

803
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,561
You can make them stop.

804
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,021
No, he can't.

805
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,686
Shut your mouths.

806
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,610
Can't be helped, young lady.

807
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,522
- Oh, please...
- Shut up!

808
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:52,148
You can't let them kill me.

809
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,821
Don't pay him no mind.

810
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:02,121
You like this face?

811
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,136
<i>You're
crazy!</i>

812
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:21,557
You got to make them stop!

813
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:22,850
Please!

814
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:25,394
He's nothing.
He's just a cook.

815
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:29,152
Shut up, you bitch hog.

816
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:33,319
Me and Leatherface
do all the work.

817
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:35,488
He don't like it.
Ain't that right?

818
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,985
You're just a cook!

819
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:39,658
Shut your mouth!

820
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:43,078
You don't understand nothing.

821
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,167
I understand you ain't nothing.

822
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:46,878
Me and him do all the work.

823
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:50,089
I, I just can't take no
pleasure in killin'.

824
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:56,888
Well, there's just some
things you got to do,

825
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:58,427
don't mean you have to like it.

826
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:01,426
Oh, please, please...

827
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:03,894
What do you want?

828
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,185
I'll do anything...anything...

829
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:11,440
I'll do...I'll do anything
you want.

830
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:33,295
Make it stop!

831
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:18,048
No need to torture
the poor girl.

832
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:18,760
You just shut up!

833
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:20,345
Remember you're just the cook

834
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,431
and me and him
will handle this.

835
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,142
Then get on with it.

836
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,635
I won't have this.

837
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,811
We ain't in no hurry

838
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,809
because you ain't
going no place.

839
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,276
No...

840
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:35,987
You hear me?

841
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:38,197
It heard you
but it don't mean much.

842
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:43,569
No sense in waiting.

843
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:45,117
I got to open up in the morning.

844
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:49,701
I been...I been thinking about

845
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:51,953
letting Grandpa have some fun.

846
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:53,955
You always said he's the best.

847
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,082
Oh, he's the best, all right.

848
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,005
Let's let him have a whack.

849
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,424
Hey, Grandpa,

850
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,638
we going to let you
have this one!

851
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:13,850
Let's let him have a whack.

852
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:20,448
Now you, you just hush.

853
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,863
It won't hurt none.

854
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:27,239
Why, old Grandpa is the
best killer there ever was.

855
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:30,708
Why, it never took more
than one lick, they say.

856
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,919
Why, he did sixty in
five minutes once.

857
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:37,416
They say he could've done more
if the hook and pull gang

858
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:41,340
could've gotten the beeves
out of the way faster.

859
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:44,260
Now, now,
now don't you cry none.

860
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,258
Old Grandpa's the best.
It won't hurt a bit.

861
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:52,851
No! No!

862
01:16:57,947 --> 01:16:59,358
No! No!

863
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:04,659
No! No! No! No!

864
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,408
Oh, please don't!

865
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,372
Please! Please!

866
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,865
Please don't!

867
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:13,163
No, no!

868
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,670
No!

869
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:27,014
Hit her, Grandpa.

870
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,309
Hit her, Grandpa.

871
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:36,607
Hit her.

872
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:37,896
Come on, Grandpa.

873
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:40,315
Hit her.

874
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:43,947
Hit that bitch.

875
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:48,494
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on.

876
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:49,578
No.

877
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,581
Come on there, Grandpa.

878
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,085
Come on, Grandpa,
hit that bitch.

879
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,624
Careful there.

880
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,463
Come on, Grandpa.

881
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:01,799
You're the best, Grandpa,
get her.

882
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,214
Get the hammer.

883
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:06,212
Go ahead, go ahead, get her.

884
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:18,858
Come on.

885
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,437
<i>Give me the hammer
"I get her.</i>

886
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:23,734
Get her, get her, Grandpa.

887
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:25,072
Give me that hammer.

888
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:28,068
I'll get her.
Let me get her!

889
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:53,699
Help!

890
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:59,705
Help! Help!

891
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:38,281
Ah!

892
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:16,618
Go!

893
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,121
Go!
