Hilary Barry:<i> It's been a</i> <i>harrowing week in the news,</i>

3
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:37,167
<i>It's time for New Zealand's</i> <i>favorite pop culture reporter,</i>

David:<i> What do you make</i> <i>of New Zealanders so far?</i>

7
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:49,459
Me? Uh, I think that they're... They've been nice.

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,083
Everyone has been cool so far.

9
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,167
David:<i> What's the main thing</i> <i>you're trying to achieve here?</i>

10
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,708
Because obviously you've created a bit of a--

11
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,208
Survival.

12
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,583
He's dead.

13
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,334
- Now we're gonna spin around. - Yeah.

14
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,041
Whoa! Holy!

15
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:19,541
It's so tiring. Whoa!

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,750
David:<i> And what's your nickname</i> <i>that you've got now?</i>

17
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,417
The Donkey Lady.

18
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,500
(brays)

19
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,167
Lady: Look out! Oh, look, we're going

20
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,834
- to have a reporter kicked. - (laughs)

21
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,125
It's quite a kick.

22
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,917
David: I<i> can't say I've ever</i> <i>interviewed anyone</i>

23
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,167
that looks exactly like you before.

24
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,417
(laughs) Really?

25
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,459
David:<i> I've made a career out of</i> <i>looking at the weird</i>

26

<i>- and bizarre side of life.</i> - (laughter on computer)

27
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,667
<i>So when I discovered a strange</i> <i>video online,</i>

28
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,000
<i>I knew I'd found</i> <i>my next story.</i>

29

Man: (laughs on computer) <i>It's good. It's good.</i>

31
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,292
David:<i> An American company</i> <i>called Jane O'Brien Media</i>

32
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:26,708

<i>Young athletes from anywhere</i> <i>on the planet could apply.</i>

34
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,041

35
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:38,541
<i>Four nights in a really</i> <i>nice hotel and $1500 cash.</i>

36
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:43,208
<i>It was called competitive</i> <i>endurance tickling.</i>

37
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:46,041
Man:<i> You're with the CET,</i>

38
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,999
a competitive endurance tickling group we got here.

39
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,500
And, uh, first of all I'd like to give a shout to you,

40
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,083
Jane O'Brien Media, for making this happen.

41
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,541
- Thanks, Jane. - We all appreciate it.

42
00:02:56,208 --> 00:03:02,875

43

David:<i> Their Facebook page</i> <i>was popular,</i>

00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:44,000
David:<i> So, of course,</i> <i>I told Jane O'Brien Media</i>

56

135
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,667
<i>Things certainly weren't</i> <i>getting any less weird.</i>

136
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:49,041
<i>His letter told us to stop</i> <i>what we were doing, or else.</i>

137
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,334
<i>Soon we were receiving e-mails</i> <i>from Salta telling us</i>

<i>that legal action</i> <i>had been filed in the US.</i>

139
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,334
<i>I had no money to hire a</i> <i>New Zealand lawyer,</i>

<i>let alone face</i> <i>the American justice system.</i>

141
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,667
<i>Then, to top it all off,</i> <i>Jane O'Brien Media told us</i>

142
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:20,125
<i>they were flying three people</i> <i>across the world from New York</i>

148
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:47,375

David: How's it going?

153
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,292

154
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:13,125
- It's so nice to meet you. - Good. How are you, sir?

155

It's so nice for you to come and see us.

156
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,041
That's all right. I thought I'd arrive. How was the flight?

157
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,041
It was wonderful, really wonderful.

158
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,292
- Oh, good. - Got some good sleep.

This is... look at this sign...

165
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,583
We want to keep this. Can we have that for later?

166
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,459
- You can, I gift this to you. - It's gorgeous.

167
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,375
As a sign, I thought it was pretty good.

168
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,417
Thank you so much, it's wonderful.

169
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,500
Well, look, let's line up a time to meet this week.

170
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,541
Marko: We just need to rest today and then tomorrow.

171
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,334
Actually if you're free we can do tomorrow?

172
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,875
- David: Tomorrow? - Adam: Tomorrow will be fine.

173
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,000
Marko: Tomorrow would be good.

174
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,500
David: Okay, tomorrow works well.

175
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,292
Kevin: Thank you very much for coming out, what a surprise.

176
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:51,167
Marko: It's so nice of you.

177
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,917
David: Oh, that's okay. It's the New Zealand hospitality.

178
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,750
David: You can get me there. Kevin: Are we on camera

179
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,041
right now?

180
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,083
David: Yeah, we're just rolling from the beginning. Yeah, yeah.

181
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,334
I'd prefer if you didn't do that without telling me first.

182
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,167
Okay. We've got a thing in New Zealand,

183
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,541
we're okay to film in public spaces.

184
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,792
So I'm just following the journey.

185
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,708
Listen, we're not... We're not going to have good time

186
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,834
if you do this.

187
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,959
If you don't tell me what you're doing first

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,708
- we're going to get along. - Okay, all right. Well, we're--

189
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,167
Adam: Yeah, I really don't like this either.

190
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,375
It's not--

191
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:21,792
David: Okay. Well, I mean, we're shooting a documentary,

192
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,167
so we'll keep... It's a--

193
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,708
I understand what you think you're doing...

194
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,334
- David: Mm. - but I'm not going to allow

195
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,208
you to do... to treat me without respect.

196
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,125
David: Okay.

197
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,000
and that's what you're doing right now.

198
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,500
Okay. We're okay to film in public spaces in New Zealand,

199
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,083
- so we're doing that here. - Yeah, I hope you have fun

200
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,000
doing that.

201
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,917
David: All right, we'll see you soon.

202
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,083
- Marko: We'll talk later. - David: Okay, sounds good.

203
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,292
- Thank's again. - All right, see you soon.

204
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,375
- Marko: Thanks man. - David: No worries.

205
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,375
We'll talk soon.

206
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,708
(phone line rings)

207
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,375
Marko:<i> Hello?</i>

208
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,500
David:<i> Hey, Marko.</i> <i>It's Dave Farrier. How are you?</i>

209
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,500
Marko:<i> David,</i> <i>I am good, how are you doing?</i>

210
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,875
David:<i> Yeah, good. How are you</i> <i>settling into Auckland?</i>

211
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,375
Marko:<i> We love it here.</i>

212
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,875
Marko:<i> You know we wanted</i> <i>to just, you know,</i>

213
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,417
<i>at least for the first meeting,</i>

214
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:17,750
<i>just sort of speak</i> <i>without cameras</i>

215
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,583
<i>and just let you know</i> <i>what we're doing.</i>

216
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:23,041
Okay. No, that sounds good to me, I think.

217
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:27,041
Just, Dylan and I both talked, and we just weren't confident,

218
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,541
or didn't think it was a good idea

219
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:31,334
just to go straight to a room. Maybe it's a cultural thing.

220
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,667
<i>But a conference room</i>

221
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,583
-<i> um, of your choosing,</i> <i>-</i> Marko:<i> Okay.</i>

222
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,708
<i>whether it's at the Hilton or</i> <i>elsewhere, is absolutely fine.</i>

223
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,583
Marko:<i> One of the reasons</i> <i>that it's hard for us to.</i>

224
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,459
<i>go on camera or to take part</i> <i>in the documentary is that...</i>

225
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,334
<i>uh, first of all we don't think</i> <i>it would be very good</i>

226
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,792
<i>for the company that we work for</i>

227
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:55,750
<i>because it seems</i> <i>like the spin...</i>

228
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,834
<i>we have no control over</i> <i>what the spin would be.</i>

229
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,583
(indistinct conversation)

230
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,875
Marko:<i> And, um...</i>

231
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,167
<i>And you know...</i> <i>we have nothing to do with...</i>

232
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,459
<i>with the legal matters.</i>

233
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,999
<i>You know, I would love to see</i> <i>you guys be able to</i>

234
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,417
<i>go in a more positive direction.</i> <i>And I don't think that</i>

235
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:17,834
<i>you're going to be able to find</i>

236
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,541
<i>the answers</i> <i>that you're looking for.</i>

237
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,834
David:<i> Yep.</i>

238
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,083
Marko:<i> And as far as Jane goes,</i> <i>I've never met Jane.</i>

239
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,708
<i>You know, whoever is emailing</i> <i>you, I've never met this person.</i>

240
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,125
<i>Just... a piece of advice though</i> <i>I mean just...</i>

241
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,500
<i>kind of off the record,</i> <i>between us...</i>

242
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,375
<i>take the lawsuit seriously,</i>

243
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,375
<i>because there's a lot of money</i> <i>and the lawsuits.</i>

244
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:39,959
Dylan:<i> Yeah, and that's obvious,</i> <i>you know...</i>

245
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:42,041
<i>first class tickets</i> <i>to New Zealand, you know...</i>

246
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,334
<i>clearly there's a lot of money</i> <i>involved in the story.</i>

247
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,834
Marko:<i> I mean... just...</i> <i>you know...</i>

248
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,500
<i>whatever you plan to do is</i>

249
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,959
<i>actually going to be worth</i> <i>the trouble</i>

250
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:52,375
<i>that this person is probably</i> <i>going to put you through.</i>

251
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,208
Dylan: Can I just ask one quick question of you?

252
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,125
Kevin: Yeah, sure.

253
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:58,959
Dylan: I know that Marko and Adam

254
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,167
haven't met Jane or Debbie... have you met Jane or Debbie...

255
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,167
Kevin: No.

256
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,834
Dylan: But does it worry you that you haven't met the person.

257
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:05,667
Kevin: Absolutely not.

258
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,792
There are people in this world...

259
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:09,500
in that world... in the world of a lot of money.

260
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,500
that keep a firewall between themselves and what they do.

261
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,292
David: Sure.

262
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,334
Dylan: We have been attacked for weeks now by Jane O' Brien.

263
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,417
David: I wake up every... I wake up every morning

264
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,667
to a message from Jane O' Brien Media

265
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,792
who you guys work for

266
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:26,917
with a list of various personal attacks and also legal threats

267
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,167
That's been happening daily...

268
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,334
Kevin: You started this fight, I didn't!

269
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,459
You were the ones that decided

270
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,875
this is what you were going to do.

271
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:35,959
You mocked us.

272
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:37,500
You've done everything you could

273
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,459
you attacked us in an airport, you sidewinded us

274
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,041
so let me make a point here.

275
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,875
If you want to stick your head in a blast furnace...

276
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:45,792
do it.

277
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:51,541
(siren wails in distance)

278
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,541
(scratching)

279
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,708
David:<i> Kevin didn't take</i> <i>to Dylan very well</i>

280
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,708
<i>and wants to meet me alone.</i>

281
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,708
<i>I quickly make this</i> <i>covert piece of technology.</i>

282
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,459
<i>A camera in a coffee cup.</i>

283
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,459
Kevin: What's the end game here? What do you get at the end

284
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,041
or even if you get everything you want?

285
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:18,167
- David: Mm. Mm. - And what are we risking here?

286
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,125
You know, do we really want someone coming after you

287
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,708
with all that money?

288
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,875
I've known a lot of rich people in my life.

289
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:28,041
I've worked for a lot of them.

290
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,375
They don't work by the same set of rules.

291
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,708
They don't dangle them out of buildings any more,

292
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,459
but they don't have to.

293
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,625
And that's the thing. They start suing,

294
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,667
and you're done halfway through or a quarter of the way through

295
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,125
because it costs so much to defend yourself.

296
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,834
David: So unless... Essentially, I mean,

297
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,083
unless we stop the doco, we're gonna be fucked.

298
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,500
Really. It seems that's what it comes down to.

299
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,667
Kevin: I'm not gonna use those words directly,

300
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,167
because that wouldn't be prudent.

301
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,083
But... Let me rephrase. Unless you stopped...

302
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,167
Unless we can figure out a way to ameliorate that situation,

303
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,208
we all are.

304
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,500
David:<i> Facing lawsuits and</i> <i>a company with deep pockets,</i>

305
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,208
<i>I wondered if we should</i> <i>just walk away.</i>

306
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,917
<i>But Dylan was part of this now</i>

307
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,041
<i>and didn't want to give in to</i> <i>a bunch of bullies.</i>

308
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,750
Kevin: (over telephone) <i>Dylan wants to pursue this</i>

309
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,750
<i>on his own?</i>

310
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,500
David:<i> Uh, I gather from</i> <i>what he's saying, yeah.</i>

311
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,417
Kevin:<i> Okay.</i> <i>Um, if Dylan wants to do that,</i>

312
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,750
<i>Dylan does...</i> <i>Dylan will do that.</i>

313
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:38,500
<i>If you don't want to do that,</i> <i>then just walk away from it.</i>

314
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,667
David:<i> Yeah.</i>

315
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,000
Kevin:<i> And I will... Dylan</i> <i>will be dealt with accordingly.</i>

316
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,875
- (indistinct chatter) - How was school?

317
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:50,292
Marko: (on phone)<i> The main</i> <i>thing, David, you know, that I</i>

318
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:50,292
<i>wanted to tell you is that</i>

319
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:51,625
<i>I think that you're brilliant.</i>

320
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,625
<i>And that you have</i> <i>a great career.</i>

321
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,041
<i>So I was really,</i> <i>really happy to find out</i>

322
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,417
<i>that you wanted just to</i> <i>distance yourself from it.</i>

323
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:04,334
<i>And I don't understand why</i> <i>Dylan would not want to.</i>

324
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,417
<i>What I'm worried about too,</i> <i>I know Kevin says,</i>

325
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,041
<i>"Well, if he wants to</i> <i>go ahead with it,</i>

326
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,375
<i>let him go ahead with it."</i>

327
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:12,625
<i>But he'll become a real target,</i> <i>and believe me,</i>

328
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,041
<i>it will be really ugly for him.</i>

329
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,292
<i>And I would...</i> <i>I would hate to see that too,</i>

330
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:16,750
<i>because I know he has a family</i>

331
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,250
<i>And, you know, he's probably,</i> <i>uh, a good bloke down deep.</i>

332
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,000
(line hangs up)

333
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:28,375
(airplane flies overhead)

334
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,834
David:<i> I've never heard threats</i> <i>like this in my life,</i>

335
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,667
<i>and all of this</i> <i>over some tickling!</i>

336
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:41,250
<i>Kevin and Marko fly</i> <i>back to America.</i>

337
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,541
<i>And a few days later,</i> <i>Dylan and I follow.</i>

338
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:49,167
<i>Something about bullies</i> <i>with way too much money</i>

339
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,875
<i>has convinced me</i> <i>I shouldn't drop it.</i>

340
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,541
<i>Plus, we think there's a</i> <i>competitive tickling shoot</i>

341
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,541
<i>happening this week.</i>

342
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,834
<i>We've reached out to nearly</i> <i>a hundred boys in the videos,</i>

343
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,541
<i>But they all seem too</i> <i>nervous to talk.</i>

344
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,041
<i>Finally TJ agrees to meet us.</i>

345
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,125
<i>We met Kevin Clarke</i> <i>downtown LA somewhere.</i>

346
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:21,541
<i>I can't remember exactly where</i> <i>it was at, but it was a studio.</i>

347
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,834
<i>He seemed pretty</i> <i>normal at the time.</i>

348
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:28,500
My first impression of him, you know, he was just, like,

349
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,708
kind of... kind of a little weird.

350
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,375
<i>You know,</i> <i>I was young at the time,</i>

351
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,792
<i>didn't think nothing of it,</i>

352
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:38,375
<i>And I was like, "Cool."</i> <i>You know, $2000 or whatever,</i>

353
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:39,292
<i>"Yeah. It's gonna be cool."</i>

354
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:45,667
It was actually a hard time for my family.

355
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,834
A family member of mine was going through cancer, and money

356
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,834
was tight at the household.

357
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,459
So I was a little bit desperate at the time as well for money,

358
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,459
working on the side,

359
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,459
and doing what I can. So when I heard this dollar sign,

360
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,583
I was like, "Yeah," you know, "I'll definitely do that."

361
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,125
<i>And then I went inside</i>

362
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,625
<i>and noticed that it was</i> <i>all guys in there.</i>

363
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:07,334
<i>And that's when I was like,</i> <i>"Oh, dang!" Like...</i>

364
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,500
<i>And I didn't know I was</i> <i>gonna get tied down.</i>

365
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,334
<i>I had no idea what it'd be for.</i>

366
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,541
<i>Honestly, I was like,</i> <i>"Okay, what?"</i>

367
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,000
At that point I was like, "All right, you know what?

368
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,000
It's already going down.

369
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,375
I don't really know what it's for,

370
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,041
but hopefully it never gets out."

371
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,708
(laughing)

372
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,417
(laughing)

373
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,375
(laughing)

374
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,083
No, no, no. Not any fuckin'...

375
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:51,041
Ah! Fuck! That actually tickles, dude. (laughs)

376
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,625
Ah! Fuck! (laughs)

377
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,750
Being violated on so many different levels right now.

378
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:04,000
<i>There was other athletes.</i> <i>There was MMA guys.</i>

379
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,417
<i>there was a bodybuilder,</i>

380
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,500
<i>and then there was a couple</i> <i>of actors, normal actors.</i>

381
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,167
<i>I've seen some of them on</i> <i>commercials,</i>

382
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,334
<i>TV commercials. Normal guys.</i>

383
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,083
<i>Like, completely normal people.</i>

384
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:19,167
(laughs) Get the fuck off my feet!

385
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,667
<i>It was a torture project.</i>

386
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,041
That's what I believe Kevin Clarke told me.

387
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:27,334
There was something to do with even a military tactic,

388
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:27,334
or something like that.

389
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,208
He was gonna do...

390
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,583
I think he said Jane was doing a project

391
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,834
on using tickling as a military tactic.

392
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,167
And at that point, I...

393
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,792
I knew it was complete bullshit, you know?

394
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,041
I was like, "Okay, the military is gonna use tickling

395
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,250
as a torture tactic?"

396
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:44,667
(laughs) Fuck!

397
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:47,417
(laughing)

398
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,875
David:<i> When did the video</i> <i>come back to get you?</i>

399
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:55,167
About a year, maybe a little more, ago.

400
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:59,708
(crowd cheering)

401
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,708
(whistle blows)

402
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:06,041
TJ:<i> I would google myself</i> <i>once in a while,</i>

403
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,459
<i>to read old articles</i>

404
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:09,708
<i>or see what teams might have</i> <i>listed me in an article</i>

405
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,667
<i>or try-outs.</i>

406
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,375
(keyboard clacks)

407
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:18,708
<i>And to my surprise,</i> <i>a video was on YouTube.</i>

408
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,834
Hello. I'm TJ, and I'm here on a tickling competition.

409
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,500
And, uh, first question is: "Are you ticklish?"

410
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,667
Well, obviously I'm ticklish if I'm here, so,

411
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,292
that's kind of a silly question. But, uh...

412
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:31,667
<i>It was just me</i> <i>sitting in front of the camera</i>

413
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,500
<i>talking about the,</i> <i>uh, tickling process.</i>

414
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,000
Just weird things. And so I was like, "Okay, it's not that bad."

415
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,083
"When you are asked, 'Are you ticklish?'

416
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,625
How do you normally respond and why?"

417
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:46,459
Normally, I say, "No, I'm not ticklish."

418
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,708
<i>So I emailed Jane and asked</i> <i>her to take the video down.</i>

419
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:57,708
She didn't ever reply.

420
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,334
So I took the matters into my own hands,

421
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,334
and I, uh, told YouTube that

422
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,583
uh, they're illegally using my name.

423
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:11,792
So YouTube took the video down. That's when it all started.

424
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,792
Woman:<i> "Now, I am laughing."</i>

425
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:21,334
<i>"I don't think you've grasped</i> <i>the magnitude</i>

426
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,000
<i>of what you have provoked."</i>

427
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:26,167
<i>"I'm interested to see how you</i> <i>handle the fallout.</i>

428
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:30,667
<i>So far, badly."</i> <i>"Regards, Debbie J. Kuhn."</i>

429
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,667
<i>That's when this Deborah</i> <i>person popped into my life.</i>

430
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:37,041
I mean, just all hell broke loose.

431
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:44,334
<i>Every kind of video search you</i> <i>can find, it was up there.</i>

432
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:47,708
<i>And then it</i> <i>pops up in my emails,</i>

433
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,875
<i>and then it pops up</i> <i>more on YouTube,</i>

434
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:51,708
<i>And it just starts</i> <i>appearing everywhere.</i>

435
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,292
<i>This video...</i> <i>Just, all of them.</i>

436
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:54,875
<i>All of them start blowing up.</i>

437
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:56,708
(laughing)

438
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:05,834
And there was threats. It said, "Watch out!

439
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,125
Your family better watch out

440
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,000
because we're gonna put your last name to shame.

441
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,708
Any time you search your last name, it's gonna pop up."

442
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,500
Like, direct threats.

443
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,667
<i>They ended up making a website,</i>

444
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,292
<i>putting my</i> <i>personal information:</i>

445
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:21,208
<i>my name, my address,</i>

446
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,208
<i>my personal phone number,</i> <i>my email address,</i>

447
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,167
all with just dumb lies.

448
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,917
<i>Then Debbie Kuhn starts going</i> <i>off on me left and right,</i>

449
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:35,417
<i>sending emails to the</i> <i>high school that I coach at.</i>

450
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,959
Woman:<i> "I have additional</i> <i>information as a past employer.</i>

451
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:41,083
<i>You don't want this</i> <i>guy in your league.</i>

452
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,750
<i>Can you afford the distraction,</i> <i>the press,</i>

453
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:47,334
<i>with an outed gay guy</i> <i>having a male tickling fetish,</i>

454
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,417
<i>in which he likes to tickle</i> <i>and be tickled</i>

455
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:52,541
<i>by tied-up other gay</i> <i>athletes and bodybuilders?"</i>

456
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,459
<i>False accusations,</i> <i>saying I'm a drug addict</i>

457
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,167
and I was a child molester and I'm gay, and this and that,

458
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,459
which none of those things have ever been true.

459
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:12,375
(indistinct shouting)

460
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,500
<i>I've always been very proud.</i>

461
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:19,334
<i>The way I walk around,</i> <i>I'm proud of who I am.</i>

462
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,792
<i>You know what I mean?</i> <i>So to speak.</i>

463
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,292
<i>I'm confident in myself</i> <i>as an athlete,</i>

464
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,750
<i>as a person, as a player.</i>

465
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,541
<i>But when I'd go to try-outs,</i>

466
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,375
<i>the first thing</i> <i>I would think about is,</i>

467
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,667
<i>"Well, I wonder</i> <i>if these coaches</i>

468
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,667
<i>have looked up that video?"</i>

469
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,334
<i>And it's happened.</i> <i>It has happened.</i>

470
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,167
<i>I've been released</i> <i>from football teams.</i>

471
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,750
<i>They've told me, uh,</i>

472
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,417
that I'm the best player on that team at that position,

473
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:43,334
but because it is a distraction for the media,

474
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,334
they don't need that attention

475
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,959
and they'll go with somebody else 'cause they don't feel

476
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,959
like explaining it.

477
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,583
<i>You know, and I've actually</i> <i>dealt with a lot of things</i>

478
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,583
<i>because of it.</i>

479
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:55,875
It's cost me money, it's cost me jobs, it's caused me harassment,

480
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:59,292
which is exactly what Debbie Kuhn and Jane O'Brien wanted.

481
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:02,292
So, I mean, more or less in that aspect, they've won.

482
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:08,041
(train horn blares)

483
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,959
David:<i> It's obvious we're not</i> <i>the only ones being harassed</i>

484

485
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:20,292
<i>And there are so many websites</i> <i>made up like TJ's</i>

Dominic: Okay, car.

494
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,500
And another car. Two cars.

495

David: Two cars.

Dominic: Can you see what the car's doing?

497
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:06,459
I've lost him.

498
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:13,208
- Dominic: Who's that guy? - David: Oh, that's Marko.

499
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:19,167
Dylan: Oh, yeah. And we've got four guys going in so far.

00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,625
Dominic: Four guys.

501
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:26,834
Dylan: That's the guy from New Zealand.

502
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,500
David: Yep, there's Kevin.

503
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:49,999
(laughter echoes)

504
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:53,167
David:<i> We could hear laughter</i> <i>coming out of the vents.</i>

505
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,500
(laughter echoes)

506
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,375
<i>It went on for hours,</i>

507
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,625
<i>The boys occasionally</i> <i>taking breaks.</i>

508
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,834
You know, this is actually fucking creepy as fuck.

509
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,083
Dylan: Like, this feels to me like a pep talk.

510
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,334
Dominic: Yeah.

511
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,417
David:<i> As the day wraps up,</i>

512
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,750
<i>I want to give Kevin</i> <i>one last chance</i>

513
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:28,708
<i>to talk about what's going on.</i>

514
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,583
<i>With pending lawsuits,</i>

515
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,250
<i>I'm cautious and don't want to</i> <i>storm into the studio.</i>

516
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,625
David: They haven't locked the door.

517
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,250
Dylan: I think we go.

518
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:44,292
All right. Okay, let's go.

519
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:47,334
- David: We're good? - Dominic: Yep, we're good.

520
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,041
Dominic: Come this way.

521
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:03,208
David: Here we go. We've been spotted.

522
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:16,625
Hello, Marko. Hey, guys.

523
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:26,959
Adam, how's it going?

524
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:28,667
Adam: Oh, my god.

525
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,041
Hello, sir.

526
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,708
Kevin: You're not welcome here.

527
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:35,125
We're not welcome here?

528
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:37,083
Shut the door and I'm calling the police.

529
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:38,917
Bye. Out.

530
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,667
All right. Well, we'll head off.

531
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,167
You don't want to do any final chats or anything?

532
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,500
Last opportunity.

533
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,041
That's all we can do.

534
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:00,667
GPS:<i> Turn right</i> <i>on Bellevue Avenue,</i>

535
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,500
<i>then take the first right.</i>

536
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:07,667
I think... Yeah, uh, after New Zealand and that,

537
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:10,834
I think it's safe to say that we don't...

538
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:13,583
We don't have an interview with Kevin or Marko.

539
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,500
<i>And we certainly</i> <i>weren't getting</i>

540
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,459
<i>any more of the competitors</i> <i>to talk on camera.</i>

541
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,417
<i>They were all too terrified,</i>

542
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:24,541
<i>hoping if they stayed quiet,</i> <i>the harassment would go away.</i>

543
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:29,083
Dylan: I mean, are we making the whole thing worse for everyone

544
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,667
just by even being here?

545
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,500
David: Yeah. I think it's possible.

546
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:35,834
I worry that we make it worse for some people who...

547
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:37,834
Who've gotten through the worst of it, you know?

548
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,041
Dylan: Mm.

549
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:55,667
(scanner beeps and whirs)

550
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:58,167
David:<i> Jane O'Brien clearly</i> <i>isn't being honest</i>

551
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,959
<i>about what the videos are for.</i>

552
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,750
<i>And I'm convinced that despite</i> <i>the Adidas gear,</i>

553
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:05,292
<i>it's not a real sport.</i>

554
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,792
<i>I've tracked down</i> <i>a man in Florida</i>

555
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,750
<i>who also makes tickling videos,</i>

556
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:17,625
<i>but, unlike Jane, is more</i> <i>than happy to talk about it.</i>

557
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,417
Richard:<i> People ask me about</i> <i>what is the appeal of tickling?</i>

558
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:54,459
<i>It's kind of like the whips</i> <i>and chains, you know,</i>

559
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,000
<i>bondage sort of thing, where</i> <i>somebody's getting flogged.</i>

560
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:00,834
<i>But it's just really brought</i> <i>down a level, you know?</i>

561
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,500
<i>It's like kind of a sadistic</i>

562
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:04,834
<i>exerting your will</i> <i>on someone else,</i>

563
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:07,208
<i>and having them do something</i> <i>out of their control</i>

564
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,834
<i>like laughing without</i> <i>being able to get away,</i>

565
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:13,292
<i>as if it's, uh,</i> <i>tickle torture to them.</i>

566
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:16,167
David: And a lot of people don't seem to know

567
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:17,834
about the tickling fetish.

568
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,667
Do you think it's a little bit more unknown?

569
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,750
Oh, totally. Yeah, completely.

570
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:24,583
'Cause most people, you know, know about a foot fetish,

571
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:26,834
um, but tickling?

572
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:29,459
Most people are like, "Oh, wow. Is that a thing?"

573
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:37,625
<i>It was in 1999. I had just</i> <i>gotten out of grad school,</i>

574
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,083
<i>You know, so I just got</i> <i>a video camera,</i>

575
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,750
<i>put together a little</i> <i>business plan,</i>

576
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:45,208
<i>Talked to one of my friends</i>

577
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:47,625
<i>and he financed me,</i> <i>when I started the site,</i>

578
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,625
<i>I think for $6000 or $7000.</i>

579
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:53,583
<i>It got pretty much an</i> <i>immediate response.</i>

580
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,334
<i>I was making enough</i> <i>after a year</i>

581
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,334
<i>to quit my job</i> <i>and do it full-time.</i>

582
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,334
David:<i> So this is it?</i>

583
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,041
- This is it. - This is the studio.

584
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,208
- Mm-hm. - The chair.

585
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,208
And then the changing room, bathroom.

586
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,000
And so, this whole place is purely for the tickling?

587
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,334
Yes.

588
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:33,167
David:<i> Oh, so you've got a few</i> <i>different spaces, right?</i>

589
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,375
Richard:<i> Yeah, yeah.</i>

590
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:36,334
<i>I used to do all this</i> <i>out of my house.</i>

591
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,208
David:<i> Yeah.</i>

592
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,083
And then it was, you know, a parade of people coming in,

593
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,541
do all this, have to clean up.

594
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:45,500
You know, have to clean it up before a shoot.

595
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:48,250
And this way I can walk away.

596
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:49,375
Yeah, this is great.

597
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:50,708
Like, "I'm tired. Going home."

598
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,750
David:<i> You're done.</i>

599
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,000
<i>Well, this is work, right?</i> <i>It's like work, home.</i>

600
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,125
Richard:<i> Mm-hm. Exactly.</i>

601
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,334
Have you done stuff like this before for anyone else?

602
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,167
Or this sort of a unique thing for you?

603
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:01,583
Uh, unique thing.

604
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:04,250
I never worked for a tickling site before.

605
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:05,375
- Okay. - Man: No.

606
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:08,083
David:<i> And what did you first</i> <i>think when you got the pitch?</i>

607
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:09,500
Man:<i> I mean, I laughed about it.</i>

608
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:11,167
<i>I'm like,</i> <i>this can't be really serious,</i>

609
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,792
<i>Like, people really can't...</i>

610
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:15,750
<i>enjoy watching this</i> <i>or getting it done.</i>

611
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,667
But, um, I said, "Why not?"

612
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,208
You know, I'm more of like the risk-taker.

613
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:22,000
I'd rather say I did something than didn't do something.

614
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,041
So I came down,

615
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:25,667
really was kind of nervous, didn't know what to expect.

616
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,459
And then... But Richard put me at ease,

617
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
and once you're trapped in you're there.

618
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:32,667
So, I mean, you might as well enjoy it. (chuckles)

619
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,041
All right.

620
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:39,208
- Richard: Okay, ready? - I think you're...

621
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,583
Man: Take it easy on me today.

622
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,000
Richard: Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

623
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:44,208
Man: That's good.

624
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,083
- Got to enjoy my freedom now. - Richard: Yeah.

625
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,834
- Because I cannot. - Richard: Wave goodbye.

626
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,500
I am not getting out.

627
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,208
Oh, shit.

628
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,500
(sighs) The world of tickling.

629
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,167
(chuckles)

630
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,041
So, catch your breath.

631
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,500
- (exhales) Breath caught. - Okay.

632
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:18,250
(laughing)

633
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:25,834
All right. (laughs) Now tell everybody

634
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:27,792
what a tough guy you are.

635
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:31,000
(laughing wheezily)

636
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:36,708
(sighs) Just go. (laughs)

637
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:48,667
(laughs)

638
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,750
(laughs) Stop.

639
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:59,959
(laughing)

640
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,583
Oh, my gosh.

641
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,041
I hate this.

642
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,541
(laughing wheezily)

643
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,500
David:<i> So when did you realize</i>

644
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:54,750
<i>that you found tickling</i> <i>to be an erotic thing?</i>

645
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,125
Richard: I<i> was very young,</i>

646
00:34:57,167 --> 00:35:02,083
you know, probably five or six. You know, very, very young.

647
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:11,334
<i>You see something in a cartoon</i> <i>or a magazine that, you know,</i>

648
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,459
<i>kind of interests</i> <i>you as a little kid,</i>

649
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,334
<i>and for me it would be,</i> <i>you know, like,</i>

650
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,334
<i>cartoon characters being</i> <i>tickled or tied up or,</i>

651
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:19,792
<i>you know, that sort of thing.</i>

652
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:22,667
<i>And it would, you know,</i> <i>fascinate me,</i>

653
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:25,125
<i>but I had no idea why.</i>

654
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:50,708
- (sighs) - Richard: How do you feel?

655
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:52,667
I feel tired.

656
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:55,167
- I feel sweaty. - Can I get you some water?

657
00:35:55,208 --> 00:36:00,500
Yeah, water would probably work. (exhales heavily)

658
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:04,083
Richard: I<i> started to become</i> <i>comfortable with this, uh,</i>

659
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,917
<i>fetish and this part of myself,</i>

660
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:09,041
<i>and started to really realize</i> <i>that it was a part of myself,</i>

661
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,167
<i>when I...</i>

662
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:12,417
When I got on AOL

663
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,083
and then did a search for what I was looking for

664
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,250
and found that, "Wow!

665
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,708
There's actually, you know, quite a lot of

666
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,208
other people that are into this."

667
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,000
<i>At the time, the late '90s,</i>

668
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:32,667
<i>was, um, somebody that posted</i> <i>on the message boards a lot.</i>

669
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:37,667
<i>And she said her name was</i> <i>Terri, Terri Tickle.</i>

670
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:43,041
<i>And Terri DiSisto, she put</i> <i>in what her real name was.</i>

671
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:46,500
<i>She always had a picture</i> <i>of herself.</i>

672
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:50,167
<i>You know, a blonde,</i> <i>pretty, college-aged girl.</i>

673
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:54,125
<i>And, she always posted</i> <i>the same verbiage.</i>

674
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,834
<i>Something like,</i> <i>"This is not porn.</i>

675
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,708
<i>My interest is in tickling."</i>

676
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:02,875
<i>And she just said that she was</i> <i>a tickling fanatic and...</i>

677
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,834
But, I mean, these posts were everywhere.

678
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:08,708
(laughing on computer)

679
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,208
<i>And then, um, some videos</i> <i>started popping up,</i>

680
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,375
<i>you know, very,</i> <i>you know, innocent.</i>

681
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:14,750
(laughing on computer)

682
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:17,459
<i>And, those are probably</i> <i>the first</i>

683
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:22,292
<i>tickle videos that I</i> <i>ever saw on the Internet.</i>

684
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,334
(laughing)

685
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,959
David:<i> There are still traces of</i> <i>Terri Tickle online</i>

686
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,250
<i>from the mid-'90s,</i>

687
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,625
<i>And as Richard said,</i> <i>she was tickle-obsessed.</i>

688
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:36,334
<i>Like Jane,</i> <i>she also hired other people</i>

689
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:38,334
<i>to shoot the videos she wanted.</i>

690
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:46,417
Well, the, uh, just strange, rich brat,

691
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,583
I guess you could say.

692
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:53,167
Someone who, uh, got her rocks off by, uh,

693
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:56,000
seeing guys, uh, tied and tickled.

694
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,041
Obviously an extreme dominatrix.

695
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,250
David:<i> For most of his life,</i>

696
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:04,208
<i>Dave Starr has worked</i> <i>on the edges</i>

697
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,417
<i>of the entertainment industry,</i>

698
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:09,667
<i>even acting in a</i> <i>couple of pornos.</i>

699
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:10,917
<i>During the mid-'90s,</i>

700
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,375
<i>he noticed Terri's online posts</i> <i>wanting tickling videos...</i>

701
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:16,375
<i>lots of them.</i>

702
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,041
Dave:<i> Terri was, uh, out there</i> <i>looking for guys, uh, 18 to 23.</i>

703
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:29,500
<i>And I, uh, figured</i> <i>that it would, um...</i>

704
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,834
<i>be something</i> <i>right up my alley,</i>

705
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,541
<i>based on my, uh,</i> <i>working in casting.</i>

706
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:42,125
David: What sort of things was she recruiting for specifically?

707
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:47,167
Uh, tickle torture films. Tickle torture videos.

708
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,500
Can you turn that thing around so I can see it?

709
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,667
Man: All right.

710
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,708
- Is that all right? - Yeah, that's good.

711
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,834
(laughing)

712
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:02,541
Dave:<i> She claimed it was</i> <i>for a private collection,</i>

713
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,417
<i>so I was thinking,</i> <i>"Okay, amateur hour."</i>

714
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:11,708
(laughing)

715
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:18,917
<i>But me, I rapidly took it</i> <i>into a professional level.</i>

716
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:22,334
Man 1: <i>Okay, are you, uh, ticklish?</i>

717
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,083
Man 2:<i> Uh, yes, I am.</i>

718
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:26,459
Man 1: Okay, step forward about a foot.

719
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,208
Okay. Place your hands behind your head, inter-clasp them.

720
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,250
Step back a little further, though.

721
00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:33,792
Okay, right about there.

722
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:35,083
Okay, inter-clasp them

723
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,292
and do not release them at any time

724
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,875
during the entire tickle test.

725
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:40,208
Do your worst on this one.

726
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,125
Dave:<i> We would put them</i> <i>in through</i>

727
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:44,167
<i>their stage one audition,</i>

728
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:47,750
<i>which is the questions</i> <i>and the test tickles.</i>

729
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:51,750
Man 1: Do not collapse. Stay looking up at us.

730
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:57,500
(laughing)

731
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:58,875
Stay facing us.

732
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:05,792
(laughing)

733
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:11,500
Dave:<i> Stage two is tying them to</i> <i>the table,</i>

734
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:13,000
<i>tickling them,</i>

735
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:15,041
flipping them over every 15 minutes,

736
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:18,792
kind of like a sausage or meat. (laughs)

737
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:22,167
(laughing)

738
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,667
Dave:<i> And then after that, uh,</i>

739
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:27,708
we had the competitive tickling at that point.

740
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,708
Tickle wars and stuff like that.

741
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:35,250
And that would involve a massive production.

742
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,417
(laughing)

743
00:40:49,334 --> 00:40:50,875
Woman:<i> Okay, don't laugh.</i>

744
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:53,500
<i>You're giggling already,</i> <i>aren't you?</i>

745
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,459
<i>Well, you just might be</i> <i>the type of person</i>

746
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,708
<i>that David Starr</i> <i>is looking for.</i>

747
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,041
<i>He is a Hollywood producer</i>

748
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:03,667
<i>working on a new</i> <i>reality-based game show</i>

749
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:06,125
<i>called</i> Tickle Talk.

750
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:10,334
Dave:<i> The storyline is a person</i> <i>is arrested in an amusement park</i>

751
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:10,334
<i>for not having enough fun.</i>

752
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:13,750
<i>He's taken to the mouse hole</i> <i>and tickled by beautiful women</i>

753
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:16,500
<i>until it's determined</i> <i>he's had enough fun.</i>

754
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,917
Woman:<i> It might be</i> <i>preferable to</i>

755
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:20,125
<i>eating rats or grubs</i> <i>on</i> Survivor

756
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:22,041
<i>but just barely.</i>

757
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:25,083
<i>I'm Anne James,</i> KSEN K96 News.

758
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:28,250
David:<i> Dave Starr had steady</i> <i>work for five years,</i>

759
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:31,625
<i>Even when Terri was</i> <i>hospitalized for six months.</i>

760
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:33,417
<i>During that time,</i>

761
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:35,083
<i>She just wrote</i> <i>letters specifying</i>

762
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,167
<i>exactly what she wanted</i> <i>in the tickling videos.</i>

763
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:40,417
Terri: <i>"David, Merry Christmas!</i>

764
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,667
<i>So sorry,</i> <i>I'm in the hospital with mono."</i>

765
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,667
<i>"David, just a few things</i> <i>I need you to do..."</i>

766
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:48,375
<i>"Tell them I will send the</i> <i>computer as soon as I'm well."</i>

767
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,667
<i>"His name is Josh." "I hope</i> <i>to be online again in Feb."</i>

768
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:54,208
<i>"I'm still sick in bed."</i> <i>"That's all for now. TD."</i>

769
00:41:57,334 --> 00:41:59,792
My most ticklish place is, I guess...

770
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:05,083
definitely, like... It'd have to be in my legs...

771
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:09,417
more than, like, my armpits or my feet, I think, but...

772
00:42:09,459 --> 00:42:11,959
Dave:<i> At that time</i> <i>she wanted to put up</i>

773
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,500
and did indeed put up a website for a while, uh,

774
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:19,500
unauthorized releasing of the videos...

775
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,583
against the agreement of the talent,

776
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,583
and I flipped my lid.

777
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,625
And, lo and behold,

778
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:30,583
she goes and registers domains in their names

779
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:32,834
and then proceeds to...

780
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:37,708
release all their content on to those particular websites.

781
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:44,375
(distorted laughter)

782
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,125
Alden:<i> She was, like,</i> <i>sending me emails about, um,</i>

783
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:52,375
<i>"What do you think</i> <i>your mother's</i>

784
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:54,125
<i>gonna think about this?"</i>

785
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:58,500
<i>And then, like, I'd be like,</i> <i>you know, "Fuck you, bitch."</i>

786
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:03,000
<i>And she'd be, like...</i> (tuts) <i>like, totally antagonizing.</i>

787
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:08,208
<i>Like...</i> (stutters) <i>I mean, she was such a cunt.</i>

788
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:16,625
It was an assault not just on me but on my family, you know?

789
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:20,375
I mean, I couldn't have a more conservative family, you know?

790
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:24,208
I'm, I'm in a family full of republican, military people,

791
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,667
And I'm a... I was a professional banker.

792
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:32,292
And here I am, like, with basically a porn site,

793
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:35,459
where I'm not naked, but, I mean, I might as well be.

794
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,625
(sighs) You know, this was ruining my life at the time.

795
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:39,541
That's how I felt.

796
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:43,292
It certainly was affecting my ability to function,

797
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:48,834
(stutters) because it was so emotionally draining.

798
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:54,417
Part of the reason was because there's nobody to help me.

799
00:43:55,583 --> 00:44:00,041
It's like you lose control over, you know, your life.

800
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,041
Dave:<i> Well, that's when the,</i> <i>uh, crap started happening,</i>

801
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:12,459
<i>uh, with me.</i>

802
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,583
<i>Um, you decide,</i> <i>"Okay, because I, uh,</i>

803
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:19,875
<i>I closed down</i> <i>submissions for her,</i>

804
00:44:19,917 --> 00:44:20,917
<i>And,</i>

805
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:25,667
I guess, I basically was like her tickling drug dealer,

806
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:29,292
And, uh, since she wasn't getting her drug any more,

807
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:32,167
She was going through tickle withdrawals. (laughs)

808
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:35,708
David: And what happened?

809
00:44:36,459 --> 00:44:39,834
I started, uh, receiving the, uh,

810
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:44,041
strange postcards, and the, uh, strange messages.

811
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:49,041
The, uh... The, uh, talent was starting to receive messages.

812
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,250
And, uh, she also deployed a thing called the phone blaster,

813
00:44:54,292 --> 00:45:00,834
Which was to call everybody with obscene messages.

814
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:05,375
Woman: (on tape)<i> You have been</i> <i>identified as a known associate</i>

David:<i> This person's on drugs.</i> (laughs)

825
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:43,334
This person's gotta be on crystal or something,

826
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:47,459
or taking cocaine up the ass, or something like that.

827
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:49,625
It was weird.

828
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,834
I'm glad to be able to make this available to you.

829
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:57,667
David:<i> David kept a number of</i> <i>letters Terri had sent him</i>

830
00:45:57,708 --> 00:46:00,875
<i>and was keen to show me</i> <i>the extent of the abuse.</i>

00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:06,375
- All right. - This is the magic stuff.

832
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:08,792
All right, what have we got?

833
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:15,834
Yeah. Uh, these are basically copies

834
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:18,625
of what she would post online.

835
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:20,875
So who's Barbara? Is that your...?

836
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:22,083
That's my mother.

837
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:24,667
David: "Hairy and horny. Hairy and horny.

838
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:26,999
Jewish tickle filmer David W. Starr

839
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:28,667
is hook-nosed, hairy and horny."

840
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:34,083
(laughs) She's used that tagline for many, many, many times.

841
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,500
What did your...?

842
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:37,334
What did your mother think of this stuff

843
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,417
when this turned up? I mean...

844
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:41,459
Actually, her phrase was, uh...

845
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,541
Here's a, uh, note that she left me because, uh,

846
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:46,583
she would hold these for me in the mail

847
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:49,999
and basically just say, "Here's another nasty thing."

848
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,375
And that one actually is unopened.

849
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:55,292
I've never even opened it to this date.

850
00:46:56,583 --> 00:47:01,541
And let's see what our little illustrious friend had to say.

851
00:47:01,959 --> 00:47:04,208
Oh, God. So it's a card.

852
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:08,999
David: "Roses are red, violets are bue."

853
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:10,625
Can't spell worth shit.

854
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:13,500
"David W. Starr has brought this upon you.

855
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:16,541
Perhaps you wish, perhaps instead,

856
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,167
that David your failure, not Edward, were dead."

857
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:21,875
That's a reference to my brother, who is dead.

858
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:26,459
That's, uh, really extreme. A little bit psycho.

859
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:29,292
But, I mean, what...? When you were getting all this material

860
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:32,125
and some of it's talking about your brother who

861
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:33,500
- has passed away and... - Uh-huh.

862
00:47:33,541 --> 00:47:34,999
Writing this stuff to your mother,

863
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:37,708
I mean, that, that must have...

864
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:42,417
I mean, that... that's not nice receiving that on weekly basis.

865
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:46,708
Uh, no, but it was on a weekly basis, uh, yeah.

866
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:50,667
Yeah, where did they have the time?

867
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:54,959
- Jeez, it's a birthday card. - Yeah.

868
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:56,208
"Happy birthday.

869
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:01,834
Edward Starr dead." This is really cruel, right?

870
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:03,250
It's very sick.

871
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:09,667
David:<i> The more I hear</i> <i>about Terri DiSisto,</i>

872
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:12,500
<i>the more she sounds</i> <i>like Jane O'Brien.</i>

873
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:16,417
<i>To state the obvious, they</i> <i>both really enjoy tickling.</i>

874
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:19,459
<i>They also like being in</i> <i>control and lashing out.</i>

875
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,417
I really appreciate it and stay in touch.

876
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:26,041
David:<i> And it turns out</i> <i>Terri's habits started</i>

877
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,334
<i>way before Dave Starr</i> <i>got involved.</i>

878
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:31,208
<i>I've found a journalist who'd</i> <i>spent a year uncovering</i>

879
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:35,083
<i>the truth about Terri DiSisto</i> <i>during the '90s.</i>

880
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:39,250
Hal:<i> Terri DiSisto's MO</i> <i>was to bait these boys</i>

881
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,334
<i>into making</i> <i>tickling videos with</i>

882
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,250
<i>things that they wanted, right?</i> You know, I mean,

883
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:45,834
imagine being a teenage boy,

884
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:48,875
and, like, you get this random email saying, you know,

885
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:51,999
"I saw your posting about the Phish concert, and, uh,

886
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:53,334
how would you like to go?"

887
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:55,834
Or, " I can send you $1000 cash."

888
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57,667
And you're like... you're living in your dorm

889
00:48:57,708 --> 00:49:00,375
at James Madison University. You're like, "Yeah, sure.

890
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:03,708
You're gonna send me $1000 cash. Right."

891
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:07,250
<i>FedEx pulls up in front of your</i> <i>dorm the next day,</i>

892
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:10,459
<i>and there is ten $100 bills.</i>

893
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,125
<i>You haven't done anything.</i>

894
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:16,459
<i>She would just keep sending</i> <i>them whatever they wanted,</i>

895
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,041
<i>you know. Computers,</i> <i>cameras, more cash,</i>

896
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,292
<i>tickets to rock concerts.</i>

897
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:26,583
<i>Then at some point,</i> <i>even a teenage boy</i>

898
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:29,125
<i>has all the toys</i> <i>that they want.</i>

899
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,999
<i>And they say, "I... I'm done."</i>

900
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:38,375
<i>But I think the thing that</i> <i>she hates the most was no.</i>

901
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:42,625
It was like... A bomb went off.

902
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:46,750
<i>And she'd say, "Well,</i>

903
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:50,708
<i>if you don't do it,</i> <i>I'm gonna make your life hell."</i>

904
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:54,167
<i>"I'm gonna send clips</i> <i>of these videos</i>

905
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:55,541
<i>to your wrestling coach."</i>

906
00:49:56,999 --> 00:49:58,750
<i>"I'm gonna send clips of</i> <i>these videos to your mom."</i>

907
00:49:58,792 --> 00:50:01,417
<i>"I'm gonna send clips of these</i> <i>videos to your grandmother."</i>

908
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:03,125
<i>"I'm gonna send</i> <i>clips of these videos</i>

909
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,334
<i>to the president</i> <i>of your university."</i>

910
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:06,999
<i>"I'm gonna post them</i> <i>all over the Internet."</i>

911
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:09,708
"I'm gonna pretend to be you and do things on the Internet

912
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,459
that are gonna create a terrible reputation for you."

913
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,959
"I'm gonna shut down the entire college campus computer system

914
00:50:16,999 --> 00:50:20,334
at your college, and they're gonna think it's you."

915
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:23,708
And then it happened.

916
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,500
Debbie:<i> The first story I did</i> <i>was because</i>

917
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:44,792
<i>she was attacking, um,</i> <i>Drexel University.</i>

918
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:50,792
And I found the student who, um,

919
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:53,667
had made a number of videos for her.

920
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:56,750
(laughs)

921
00:50:56,792 --> 00:51:00,375
<i>And when he came to</i> <i>Philadelphia to go to college,</i>

922
00:51:00,417 --> 00:51:02,708
<i>she wanted him to</i> <i>continue making these videos,</i>

923
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,334
<i>and he wanted to cut off his</i> <i>relationship with her.</i>

924
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:09,375
<i>And she retaliated</i> <i>on so many levels.</i>

925
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:12,750
<i>Their email servers' computers</i> <i>were being shut down</i>

926
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:14,834
<i>with these</i> <i>denial-of-service attacks</i>

927
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:17,750
<i>that indicated that they</i> <i>were coming from him.</i>

928
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:23,208
<i>Email-bombing the White House,</i>

929
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,417
<i>indicating that</i> <i>it came from him.</i>

930
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,041
<i>Yeah, that's pretty serious</i> <i>stuff when the Secret Service</i>

931
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:32,834
<i>shows up in your college dorm</i> <i>and you're 19 years old.</i>

932
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:34,334
(pounding on door)

933
00:51:39,334 --> 00:51:42,250
<i>I was just curious,</i> <i>and I somehow</i>

934
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:46,167
<i>started contacting</i> <i>Terri on AOL.</i>

935
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:47,541
<i>She had an account.</i>

936
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:52,334
<i>And we would have these</i> <i>chats late at night.</i>

937
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:57,708
<i>And I was curious what kind of</i> <i>mind was behind this...</i>

938
00:51:58,334 --> 00:52:00,667
<i>celebrated Internet personage.</i>

939
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:04,500
<i>And it was,</i> <i>it was kind of crazy.</i>

940
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,417
<i>We would have</i> <i>these conversations,</i>

941
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,083
and she would...

942
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:10,541
When she realized that I did wine, she would say,

943
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:12,959
"Oh, I'm having a glass of Chardonnay!"

944
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:17,208
And I could just hear this voice because as it went on,

945
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,500
It was almost like she was completely intoxicated

946
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:24,208
with this power that she had to...

947
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,125
to be so destructive against people.

948
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:41,792
Hal: I<i> got word about a kid</i> <i>who refused to make the videos.</i>

949
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:45,834
<i>He posted that</i> <i>he needed some help,</i>

950
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:48,417
<i>and somebody said</i> <i>they would help him.</i>

951
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:54,459
<i>And somehow he got</i> <i>emailed a file,</i>

952
00:52:55,583 --> 00:52:59,834
<i>and he was told, "If you email</i> <i>this zip file to Terri,</i>

953
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:01,541
<i>she will leave you alone."</i>

954
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:07,208
And then he sent me that zip file.

955
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:15,417
<i>You know, and I remember</i> <i>opening it up and thinking...</i>

956
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:20,417
"Wow! You know, this is it. Like, this is...

957
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:22,583
this is the smoking gun."

958
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:33,041
David:<i> The zip file contained</i> <i>documents from her hard drive.</i>

959
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:37,250
<i>As expected, there were files</i> <i>relating to tickling shoots.</i>

960
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:44,792
<i>But they also revealed the</i> <i>true identity of Terri Tickle.</i>

961
00:53:57,708 --> 00:53:59,208
Hal:<i> David D'Amato.</i>

962
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:04,541
<i>She is really he, right?</i>

963
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:18,208
Debbie:<i> He was an assistant</i> <i>principal in a high school?</i>

964
00:54:20,999 --> 00:54:22,375
<i>I just...</i>

965
00:54:25,334 --> 00:54:28,667
couldn't believe it.

966
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:31,459
I don't know why, but it just seemed...

967
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,500
Here is this sadistic person exploiting these young people,

968
00:54:35,959 --> 00:54:37,667
often underage,

969
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:42,708
making their lives miserable, embarrassing them,

970
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:45,500
to an extent that it's every...

971
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:49,541
It goes against everything that an educator should be doing.

972
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:59,500
Hal:<i> When I did some more</i> <i>checking, I found out that</i>

973
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:03,041
<i>he had worked at, like,</i> <i>eight schools in ten years.</i>

974
00:55:04,292 --> 00:55:06,041
Which to me was always a red flag

975
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,500
that there was something else going on.

976
00:55:07,541 --> 00:55:10,583
I mean, that's more than just sheer incompetence.

977
00:55:12,959 --> 00:55:17,041
<i>And then I found</i> <i>social security numbers for her</i>

978
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:19,375
<i>that he had</i> <i>gotten fraudulently...</i>

979
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:22,167
<i>with dead people's names.</i>

980
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:31,208
<i>So I contacted the FBI.</i>

981
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:35,375
<i>I turned over all my</i> <i>information to them.</i>

982
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:40,375
Within a week, they busted him.

983
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:55,208
Debbie:<i> We were shocked</i> <i>at the sentencing</i>

984
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,834
<i>because he got off so easy.</i>

985
00:55:57,875 --> 00:56:00,750
<i>For somebody who had done so</i> <i>much damage,</i>

986
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:03,875
to me it was just extraordinary.

987
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,167
And to not, to not have restrictions on their

988
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:11,250
Internet access after that, how could...?

989
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:14,917
And the... Oh! And the idea that he was going to law school

990
00:56:14,959 --> 00:56:16,583
was just absurd.

991
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,834
David:<i> It turns out</i> <i>David D'Amato's father, George,</i>

992
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:24,708
<i>co-founded one of wall street's</i> <i>biggest law firms,</i>

993
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:29,125
<i>D'Amato &amp; Lynch, and David</i> <i>got a really great lawyer.</i>

994
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:32,583
<i>Instead of prison, D'Amato was</i> <i>allowed to serve his sentence</i>

995
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:34,667
<i>in the halfway house</i> <i>while he studied law</i>

996
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:38,541
<i>at his father's alma mater,</i> <i>Fordham University.</i>

997
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:43,625
Hal:<i> The judge,</i> <i>for some reason,</i>

998
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:47,125
<i>Decided that he would endorse</i> <i>the law school path, right?</i>

999
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:49,750
<i>Because, like, this is exactly</i> <i>the kind of person</i>

1000
00:56:49,792 --> 00:56:51,417
<i>that should be a lawyer, right?</i>

1001
00:56:51,459 --> 00:56:54,667
Somebody who has defrauded people,

1002
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,917
somebody who has stolen people's identities.

1003
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:58,500
A federal freakin' crime, right?

1004
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:01,792
I mean... (laughs) Like, you know, stolen identity.

1005
00:57:01,834 --> 00:57:04,167
Stolen a social security number of a dead woman,

1006
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:06,292
of two dead people, right?

1007
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:12,334
<i>It said, "David D'Amato,</i> <i>39, of Garden City,</i>

1008
00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:15,334
<i>plead guilty</i> <i>for two federal counts of</i>

1009
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:17,041
<i>computer fraud and abuse."</i>

1010
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:22,334
<i>Nothing about the tickling,</i>

1011
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:26,541
<i>nothing about the boys, nothing</i> <i>about the identity theft.</i>

1012
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:28,208
Zero. Nothing.

1013
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:32,208
David:<i> Once Fordham became</i> <i>aware of D'Amato's convictions,</i>

1014
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,292
<i>his admission was revoked.</i>

1015
00:57:34,334 --> 00:57:35,834
<i>No longer able to study law,</i>

1016
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:38,750
<i>D'Amato finished</i> <i>his sentence in prison.</i>

1017
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:42,041
<i>But I've realized that</i> <i>didn't stop the tickling.</i>

1018
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:45,583
David: So, this is 2002. So this is writing to David Starr,

1019
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:48,000
who would shoot these boys tickling

1020
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:49,750
and then send the videos...

1021
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:52,375
to Terri. That was a, that's--

1022
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:54,834
because she, what she would have is...

1023
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:57,500
- Do you want your glasses? - Back in the early days...

1024
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,667
Yeah. Back in the early days...

1025
00:58:01,334 --> 00:58:07,708
Terri would have friends tickle them and send them the...

1026
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,583
They were amateur tapes.

1027
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:12,125
- These are now professional? - Well, this is...

1028
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:13,834
- Look at the date on it. - '02?

1029
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:15,000
Look at the date.

1030
00:58:16,334 --> 00:58:19,167
- Is the "T" Terri? - Yeah, it's Terri writing.

1031
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:23,625
So that was during, um, lock-up time.

1032
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,125
Oh, in jail. I get it.

1033
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:31,583
"David, a few other things. Email... Explain my illness."

1034
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:33,959
Oh. "Tell him I'll pay everything owed

1035
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,792
as soon as the mono is better."

1036
00:58:36,834 --> 00:58:42,625
Oh. "Get Headshots." My God! Oh, my God!

1037
00:58:43,792 --> 00:58:50,125
"I won't be online for a while as I am very sick." Oh.

1038
00:58:56,041 --> 00:59:00,708
- Couldn't stop. - No. No.

1039
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,834
David:<i> It seems that</i> <i>since the mid-'90s,</i>

1040
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:08,083
<i>David D'Amato has never</i> <i>stopped finding elaborate ways</i>

1041
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:10,708
<i>to get young men</i> <i>to tickle each other.</i>

1042
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:12,750
<i>His persona of Terri Tickle</i>

1043
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:16,292
<i>seems to have dropped off the</i> <i>radar around 2006.</i>

1044
00:59:16,959 --> 00:59:21,208
<i>A while later, Jane O'Brien</i> <i>arrived on the scene.</i>

1045
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,834
<i>We've posted</i> <i>this theory online,</i>

1046
00:59:26,875 --> 00:59:29,667
<i>and David D'Amato is not happy.</i>

1047
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,875
<i>He's hired not one, but two</i> <i>private investigators,</i>

1048
00:59:34,917 --> 00:59:38,041
<i>one in New Zealand</i> <i>and one in New York.</i>

1049
00:59:39,459 --> 00:59:43,041
<i>The message is clear. They tell</i> <i>us to stop what we're doing</i>

1050
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:47,208
<i>and that D'Amato has nothing</i> <i>to do with Jane O'Brien Media.</i>

1051
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:50,041
<i>On top of that,</i>

1052
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:53,625
<i>David D'Amato has also hired</i> <i>a New Zealand lawyer.</i>

1053
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:56,334
<i>He's demanding</i> <i>an apology and retraction</i>

1054
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:59,541
<i>or else he'll see us</i> <i>in a New Zealand court.</i>

1055
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:09,959
<i>We're now being attacked</i>

1056
01:00:11,334 --> 01:00:12,500
<i>by Jane O'Brien's lawyers</i> <i>on one side</i>

1057
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:14,541
<i>and David D'Amato's</i> <i>on the other,</i>

1058
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,292
<i>both insisting they have</i> <i>nothing to do with each other.</i>

1059
01:00:19,334 --> 01:00:22,334
<i>Once again, we're way</i> <i>out of our depth.</i>

1060
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:27,000
<i>Things get even more surreal</i>

1061
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,834
<i>with a phone call</i> <i>from Michigan,</i>

1062
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,375
<i>where there's a very different</i> <i>tickling operation</i>

1063
01:00:31,417 --> 01:00:33,417
<i>also being run by Jane.</i>

1064
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:40,417
Jordan: (over phone)<i> Um,</i> <i>a couple of they guys</i>

1065
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:40,417
<i>are nervous because, uh...</i>

1066
01:00:40,459 --> 01:00:42,000
<i>they've...</i> <i>they've threatened us...</i>

1067
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:43,959
<i>uh, death threats.</i>

1068
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,375
<i>I've had, uh,</i> <i>private phone calls come in:</i>

1069
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,375
<i>"We'll kill you."</i>

1070
01:00:48,959 --> 01:00:52,125
<i>And then Jane sent some, uh</i>

1071
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,792
<i>stuff that was, I guess,</i> <i>like really threatening,</i>

1072
01:00:55,834 --> 01:00:57,667
<i>to a couple of the guys.</i>

1073
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:59,750
<i>telling us we'd better keep</i> <i>our mouths shut...</i>

1074
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:01,541
<i>to not talk to you.</i>

1075
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:04,750
<i>I got a phone call from a weird</i> <i>number out of Jamaica</i>

1076
01:01:06,417 --> 01:01:08,459
<i>I got another one today saying.</i>

1077
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,500
<i>if I talk to you or anybody else</i> <i>then they're coming for me.</i>

1078
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:23,334
David:<i> So, like,</i> <i>crime is pretty high--</i>

1079
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:25,125
- Jordan:<i> Yeah--</i> <i>- ...here, right?</i>

1080
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:30,041
<i>Murder, robberies, um, rape,</i> <i>I mean, theft.</i>

1081
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:31,750
It's all up there,

1082
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:35,292
especially for being as small, um, as what it is.

1083
01:01:35,334 --> 01:01:37,083
We've made it now, uh,

1084
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:41,750
on to the top 100 most dangerous cities in the United States.

1085
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:44,000
David: <i>Do you think on some level</i>

1086
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:47,500
<i>Jane kind of directed things</i> <i>here because it is a poor area?</i>

1087
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:51,250
Yeah, you know, the poverty level, you know,

1088
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:52,792
- is easy to target, you know. - Mm.

1089
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,417
Thousands of dollars in kids' hands is...

1090
01:01:55,459 --> 01:01:57,625
That's a, that's a big, big deal.

1091
01:01:57,667 --> 01:02:00,875
(dogs bark in distance)

1092
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:07,334

(man announces indistinctly)

1098
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:49,834
David:<i> Jane has taken a liking</i> <i>to one of Muskegon's main</i>

1099
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:49,834
<i>sports, mixed martial arts.</i>

1100
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:54,334
<i>A group of young, athletic men</i> <i>desperate for extra money.</i>

Jordan:<i> That's what</i> <i>she was trying to do,</i>

1102
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:18,875
<i>is break into the MMA world.</i>

1103
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:22,375
<i>Because it's not illegal</i> <i>to tickle somebody</i>

1104
01:03:22,417 --> 01:03:25,541
<i>to get out of a submission</i> <i>in mixed martial arts.</i>

1105
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:27,834
<i>Like, she was trying</i> <i>to pitch that</i>

1106
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:28,708
<i>because she, like,</i>

1107
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:31,541
<i>looked it up in all the rules</i> <i>and everything.</i>

1108
01:03:32,334 --> 01:03:35,959
But if you tickle a guy in the middle of that ring

1109
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,667
to get out of a submission,

1110
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:40,208
you might step out of the cage and get punched in the face.

1111
01:03:40,834 --> 01:03:45,583
Like, never in a million years out of all my fights

1112
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:48,375
would I ever try to tickle somebody

1113
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:52,000
to get out of a submission. Fuck, no!

1114
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:55,208

David:<i> As an ex-fighter,</i>

1118
01:04:12,334 --> 01:04:14,125
<i>Jordan was paid to recruit</i> <i>tickling talent in the town.</i>

<i>He's the only one in Muskegon</i> <i>prepared to appear on camera.</i>

1120
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:25,708
<i>She offered my one buddy a</i> <i>2014 Chevy Cruze and $30,000.</i>

1121
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:28,334
- What? What for? To tickle? - Yeah.

1122
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:31,667
Just 'cause, like, she liked him.

1123
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:33,125
Yeah, right. She... He was a favorite.

1124
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:34,667
- Like, yeah. - Yeah.

1125
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:37,125
Asians and redheads are what they call premiums.

1126
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:39,625
If you get those, like, she gives you bonuses.

1127
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,167
I'm Jordan Schillaci, and this is CET.

1128
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:44,417
Uh, we're gonna be having a discussion,

1129
01:04:44,459 --> 01:04:47,292
more of a debate today about whether tickling

1130
01:04:47,334 --> 01:04:50,541
is effective in a combat situation.

1131
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:56,875
<i>We ended up setting up</i> <i>a tickle cell. Like,</i>

1132
01:04:56,917 --> 01:04:58,167
<i>where you get guys to come in,</i>

1133
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,917
<i>"We'll pay you and you</i> <i>pay them to audition."</i>

1134
01:05:00,959 --> 01:05:03,792
(laughs) No!

1135
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,750
<i>So we'd choose a hotel,</i> <i>nothing fancy,</i>

1136
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:12,834
<i>and, uh, the guys would come</i> <i>in and hang out, you know,</i>

1137
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:17,375
<i>smoke, drink, eat pizza,</i> <i>fuckin', and we'd hurry up</i>

1138
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:21,000
<i>and run through, you know,</i> <i>five, six, seven guys.</i>

1139
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:25,834
(both laugh and speak indistinctly)

1140
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:28,834
So you're... You were looking after the tickle cell in

1141
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:28,834
Muskegon?

1142
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:31,208
Yeah, they have them set up all over the US.

1143
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:35,125
Ohio, Michigan, Florida, New York.

1144
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:37,125
- I mean, they're everywhere. - Right.

1145
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:39,292
- And they're all for Jane? - Yeah.

1146
01:05:39,792 --> 01:05:41,208
Fuckin' hell.

1147
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:45,250
(laughing)

1148
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,500
Jordan:<i> Well, that's where</i> <i>a lot of people started</i>

1149
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:50,334
<i>getting really</i> <i>really upset, man.</i>

1150
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:51,792
<i>Because all of sudden</i> <i>these videos</i>

1151
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:54,792
<i>that are supposed to be</i> <i>just auditions were on YouTube,</i>

1152
01:05:54,834 --> 01:05:56,667
<i>Vimeo, and every other</i> <i>site you could imagine.</i>

1153
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:59,292
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i> <i>- Nobody was okay with that.</i>

1154
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:03,041
<i>One of the guys, Brodie,</i>

1155
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:06,417
<i>like, his family was very upset</i> <i>with him. It was all over.</i>

1156
01:06:06,459 --> 01:06:09,125
<i>Like, people just picked on him</i> <i>and picked on him.</i>

1157
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:12,917
<i>You know, he was underage,</i> <i>still in school.</i>

1158
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:15,417
And it wasn't supposed to go out on the Internet.

1159
01:06:15,459 --> 01:06:18,250
It wasn't supposed to be put up, and, uh,

1160
01:06:18,292 --> 01:06:22,083
you know, that just kind of sucked.

1161
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:24,292
Because, like I said, it took Brodie...

1162
01:06:24,334 --> 01:06:25,834
it hit one of the hardest.

1163
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:27,334
Like, this whole situation

1164
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:29,708
and then being underage and his parents.

1165
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,917
Who do you have to turn to? Who are you going to attack?

1166
01:06:31,959 --> 01:06:35,667
No... Jane O'Brien's a ghost. Nobody knows who it is.

1167
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:39,500
Jordan:<i> Cody-bear, no.</i>

1168
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:42,792
This is Colton, this is my nephew.

1169
01:06:42,834 --> 01:06:44,792
- David: Hey, man. - Colton, how old are you?

1170
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:47,167
How old are you?

1171
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:48,667
- Three. - You're three?

1172
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:50,083
You're three? All right.

1173
01:06:50,792 --> 01:06:53,083
- I'm David. - I'm Phil. How are you doing?

1174
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:54,500
It's nice to meet you, sir.

1175
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:57,792
I was really, really reluctant

1176
01:06:57,834 --> 01:06:59,625
when Jordan started talking about this.

1177
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:02,667
And he's like, "This lady seems straight and legit, Mom."

1178
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:06,000
I'm like, you know, "These... these boys are young."

1179
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:09,541
It's easy to believe, but when you're an old mom,

1180
01:07:09,917 --> 01:07:13,000
you're a little more leery for the boys, and,

1181
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:16,083
I was very leery right from get-go

1182
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:18,208
that the boys were gonna get into trouble

1183
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,250
and this was not legit.

1184
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:30,417
(dog barks in distance)

1185
01:07:30,459 --> 01:07:32,334
Jordan:<i> She has all the money in</i> <i>the world, it seems like,</i>

1186
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:34,583
<i>whoever it is,</i> <i>to be able to do this.</i>

1187
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:38,208
<i>But they're waiting for</i> <i>that day that you rely</i>

1188
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:41,250
<i>on that as a sole income.</i>

1189
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:43,334
<i>That was her big,</i> <i>I think, power trip.</i>

1190
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:47,167
<i>She waited until a bunch of</i> <i>us relied on that income</i>

1191
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:49,667
Because that was our only source of income.

1192
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:51,500
We'd been doing it for so long, we didn't think...

1193
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:54,292
She waited until she had complete control,

1194
01:07:54,334 --> 01:07:57,041
basically, over your situation,

1195
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:58,750
and that's when she wanted to yank that rug

1196
01:07:58,792 --> 01:08:00,375
right out from under you.

1197
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:08,375
David: David D'Amato. Have you heard that name before?

1198
01:08:08,875 --> 01:08:10,541
In relation to all this stuff?

1199
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:15,083
I am literally, like, trembling right now.

1200
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,708
Are you actually shaking?

1201
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:20,125
Yeah, I'm actually, like, shaking. Like, I'm not, like...

1202
01:08:20,167 --> 01:08:23,334
Like I said, like, from being from here, I don't take shit.

1203
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:26,500
Like, if I met up with that guy, I'd punch him right out.

1204
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:28,959
And when he woke up, he'd be strapped to a chair with a...

1205
01:08:29,041 --> 01:08:30,375
Like, I'd be like,

1206
01:08:30,417 --> 01:08:31,708
"Dude, you're telling me everything right now."

1207
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:41,083
David:<i> The tickling's still</i> <i>happening in this town.</i>

1208
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:43,667
Jordan:<i> The money is endless.</i>

1209
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:46,875
<i>I've never seen it stop coming</i> <i>and just flowing in.</i>

1210
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:48,959
<i>And it's not just through</i> <i>Michigan and LA,</i>

1211
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,041
<i>it's everywhere.</i>

1212
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:54,625
<i>Like, England,</i> <i>Australia, Italy.</i>

1213
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:57,750
<i>I mean, the money's</i> <i>still coming and going.</i>

1214
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:03,500
David:<i> This tickling empire</i>

1215
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:06,208
<i>is way bigger</i> <i>than we ever imagined.</i>

1216
01:09:07,834 --> 01:09:11,208
<i>We're going to New York</i> <i>to find David D'Amato.</i>

1217
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:30,583
(car horns honk)

1218
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:52,459
I can feel the rich/bad aura.

1219
01:09:54,792 --> 01:09:57,792
<i>David D'Amato's address is</i> <i>listed in Garden City,</i>

1220
01:09:57,834 --> 01:10:00,500
<i>an affluent suburb</i> <i>of Long Island.</i>

1221
01:10:02,834 --> 01:10:05,625
<i>He lives on the top floor</i> <i>of this building.</i>

1222
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:08,292
Lance: (over phone) <i>Lance Roberts speaking.</i>

1223
01:10:08,334 --> 01:10:10,083
David: <i>Oh, hi. It's David speaking.</i>

1224
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:12,875
<i>I just wanted to talk to</i> <i>David D'Amato.</i>

1225
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,834
Lance:<i> Um, okay. I can't</i> <i>give you his phone number.</i>

1226
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:17,208
<i>I really can't even</i> <i>give you any</i>

1227
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,959
<i>personal information on him.</i>

1228
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:20,541
David:<i> Okay.</i>

1229
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:22,292
Lance:<i> Do you know him?</i>

1230
01:10:22,541 --> 01:10:24,875
-<i> Yes, I do. Yes.</i> -<i> You're a friend of his?</i>

1231
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:27,708
<i>Um, I'm not a friend, no,</i> <i>but I've, um...</i>

1232
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:29,417
<i>I've been trying to get</i> <i>in touch with him</i>

1233
01:10:29,459 --> 01:10:30,875
<i>but have been struggling.</i>

1234
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:32,917
Lance:<i> Okay, what I do is,</i>

1235
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:34,708
<i>I have a way of leaving him</i> <i>a message.</i>

1236
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:37,959
<i>I can't guarantee that</i> <i>he's gonna call you back</i>

1237
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,292
<i>if he doesn't know you.</i>

1238
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:42,000
<i>- Okay, thank you so much. Bye.</i> <i>- You're welcome.</i>

1239
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,334
(line hangs up)

1240
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:49,292
(wind whistles)

1241
01:10:49,334 --> 01:10:51,334
David: <i>D'Amato never calls us back,</i>

1242
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:54,625
<i>and we've got no other way to</i> <i>contact him directly.</i>

1243
01:10:56,875 --> 01:10:58,250
So annoying.

1244
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:06,208
It's all right. There's still tomorrow.

1245
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:08,041
(elevator bell dings)

1246
01:11:09,792 --> 01:11:13,208
David:<i> But that night we get a</i> <i>frustrating phone call.</i>

1247
01:11:14,334 --> 01:11:16,834
My concern is that we can't do more or less anything

1248
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,792
we have planned for the rest of the trip.

1249
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:22,167
I know. It's, like, it's fuckin' insane.

1250
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:25,708
Okay. Bye-bye.

1251
01:11:28,459 --> 01:11:31,459
David:<i> All the threats are</i> <i>worrying our film's producer.</i>

1252
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,334
<i>He doesn't want us</i> <i>to risk provoking</i>

1253
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:36,125
<i>any further legal action</i> <i>from D'Amato.</i>

1254
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,250
So he's saying,

1255
01:11:38,667 --> 01:11:39,792
"Well, what if you do everything that you were gonna do,

1256
01:11:39,834 --> 01:11:41,417
except don't go and chase D'Amato down?"

1257
01:11:41,459 --> 01:11:43,167
And I'm like, "Well, anything we do

1258
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:45,208
that lets D'Amato know we're looking into him again."

1259
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:47,000
- Well, from now on in is that. - Yeah, literally.

1260
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:50,125
So he says, "Well, maybe we cut the thing short, then.

1261
01:11:50,834 --> 01:11:52,041
Just go home."

1262
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:55,125
I know it's like... It's fuckin' insane.

1263
01:12:04,959 --> 01:12:08,583
David:<i> The next day we put</i> <i>chasing D'Amato on hold.</i>

1264
01:12:11,834 --> 01:12:13,667
<i>I want to know how on Earth</i>

1265
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:16,208
<i>a former deputy principal</i> <i>pays for all this.</i>

1266
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:20,292
<i>We can't find any sign he's</i> <i>earning money from the videos,</i>

1267
01:12:20,334 --> 01:12:22,959
<i>but he's spending lots</i> <i>of money making them.</i>

1268
01:12:23,417 --> 01:12:26,917
<i>He's flying up to ten people</i> <i>into LA almost every month</i>

1269
01:12:26,959 --> 01:12:28,750
<i>from all</i> <i>over the world,</i>

1270
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:30,459
<i>Putting them up</i> <i>in a nice hotel,</i>

1271
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,917
<i>paying them thousands in cash.</i>

1272
01:12:33,334 --> 01:12:35,083
<i>And that's not even taking</i> <i>into account</i>

1273
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:36,417
<i>the cost of running</i> <i>tickle cells,</i>

1274
01:12:36,459 --> 01:12:38,459
<i>like the one in Muskegon.</i>

1275
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:42,541
<i>Both David's parents</i> <i>are now deceased,</i>

1276
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:45,625
<i>but his father's law firm is</i> <i>one of Wall Street's biggest.</i>

1277
01:12:46,292 --> 01:12:48,417
<i>Maybe David is</i> <i>reaping the benefits</i>

1278
01:12:48,459 --> 01:12:50,250
<i>of his father's empire.</i>

1279
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:52,625
(phone line rings)

1280
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:54,125
Woman: (over phone) <i>D'Amato &amp; Lynch.</i>

1281
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:58,125
Oh, hi. I just had an inquiry, um,

1282
01:12:58,167 --> 01:13:01,667
about the relationship with, uh, um,

1283
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:06,375
David D'Amato with the company, the son of George D'Amato.

1284
01:13:06,417 --> 01:13:08,541
Is there someone I could talk to about this?

1285
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:14,541
<i>No, I'm sorry. And Mr. D'Amato</i> <i>has been gone for a long time.</i>

1286
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:19,959
Yeah, yeah. I'm looking into the background to his son, David.

1287
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,875
And I'm just trying to figure out whether he's got

1288
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:25,000
any financial relationship with the company still.

1289
01:13:25,041 --> 01:13:28,792
<i>No, I... I really don't know.</i> <i>I'm sorry, I can't help you.</i>

1290
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:32,875
Is there someone I could talk to at D'Amato &amp; Lynch to find out?

1291
01:13:33,667 --> 01:13:37,208
<i>Mm. Not that I believe, no.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i>

1292
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,792
Okay, but there must be a way to find out, surely?

1293
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:44,334
<i>- Um, not here. Thank you.</i> - (line hangs up)

1294
01:13:56,417 --> 01:14:00,000
Woman:<i> I haven't seen David</i> <i>in quite a few years.</i>

1295
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:01,417
<i>I have no knowledge of him now.</i>

1296
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:04,792
<i>Not in many years have I</i> <i>had any contact with him,</i>

1297
01:14:04,834 --> 01:14:07,000
<i>so I really couldn't give</i> <i>you any information.</i>

1298
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:10,000
David:<i> Yeah, he's been</i> <i>pretty aggressive towards me,</i>

1299
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:12,834
<i>so I'm just trying to figure</i> <i>out what his motivations are--</i>

1300
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:15,125
Woman:<i> Get away from him,</i> <i>that's all I can tell you.</i>

1301
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:19,375
- David:<i> Really?</i> <i>- Yeah. Stay away from him.</i>

1302
01:14:30,459 --> 01:14:32,459
David:<i> This was every</i> <i>conversation I had</i>

1303
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,208
<i>with anyone even remotely</i> <i>related to David D'Amato.</i>

1304
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:39,417
<i>"I can't tell you anything,</i> <i>but stay away."</i>

1305
01:14:39,459 --> 01:14:41,834
<i>But all I want to</i> <i>do is the opposite.</i>

1306
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:45,625
<i>Someone has to confront this</i> <i>bully, lawsuits or not.</i>

1307
01:14:59,417 --> 01:15:03,500
Dylan: Okay. So, this is the car we're looking for.

1308
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:07,375
It's a Mercedes Benz ML430.

1309
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:16,041
David:<i> David D'Amato has gone</i> <i>out of his way to avoid us.</i>

1310
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:19,208
<i>We figure if we wait outside</i> <i>his apartment long enough,</i>

1311
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,375
<i>eventually he'll have to leave.</i>

1312
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:24,541
Dylan: So, that's a Chevrolet.

1313
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:27,083
Oh, hang on a second, what's this?

1314
01:15:27,125 --> 01:15:28,167
What's this? What's this?

1315
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:30,708
Okay, there's a car there. I can see it.

1316
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:33,041
Now, just in the edge. Hang on.

1317
01:15:38,917 --> 01:15:40,417
David: A Grand Cherokee.

1318
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,500
Well, maybe just a Cherokee.

1319
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:45,583
But it's certainly not a Mercedes.

1320
01:15:51,417 --> 01:15:54,625
- David: What's the time? - Dylan: 2:44.

1321
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:57,708
So we've been here for, like, four hours?

1322
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:04,625
David:<i> We've been waiting</i> <i>like this for days.</i>

1323
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:07,125
Dylan: Come on.

1324
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:10,125
David:<i> And it seems like</i> <i>he'll never come out.</i>

1325
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:13,792
Dylan: Okay. Let me just check. It's also...

1326
01:16:13,834 --> 01:16:19,208
It is the right type of car. It's got white plates.

1327
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,541
Hang on. Hang on. Okay.

1328
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,083
It's him. It's him. It's him. It's him.

1329
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:30,250
He's coming out. Just wait here.

1330
01:16:30,292 --> 01:16:32,667
Just sit here. All right, stay cool.

1331
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:35,208
Okay, I'm gonna...

1332
01:16:42,167 --> 01:16:43,541
Okay, he's up here.

1333
01:16:50,959 --> 01:16:53,083
He's in the right-hand... Is he in the left-hand lane?

1334
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:54,541
David: Yeah.

1335
01:16:55,541 --> 01:16:56,959
(Dylan sighs) He hasn't turned right.

1336
01:16:57,541 --> 01:16:58,959
He's in...

1337
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,125
Whoa! You're one car behind him.

1338
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:03,083
You're right in his... In his mirror now.

1339
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:07,375
(Dylan pants)

1340
01:17:18,959 --> 01:17:21,041
(Dylan pants)

1341
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:23,708
- I'm breathing heavily. - Yeah, same.

1342
01:17:24,917 --> 01:17:27,375
Dylan: Okay. Okay. It's cool.

1343
01:17:27,417 --> 01:17:29,334
We're right behind him now, so back off a bit,

1344
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:31,125
so we're not gonna be too close.

1345
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:34,667
(sighs) Okay.

1346
01:17:35,792 --> 01:17:38,500
Just stay... Stay back. Stay back, David.

1347
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,334
We're gonna have to stop right behind him now.

1348
01:17:40,375 --> 01:17:42,375
You might have to take the camera off the tripod, Dom.

1349
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:45,334
David: Yeah, camera off tripod, please.

1350
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:48,250
Dylan: Starbucks? Okay, this is perfect.

1351
01:17:48,292 --> 01:17:49,583
David: Okay. He'll be a while.

1352
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:53,250
Okay. I'm just gonna go and have conversation when he comes out.

1353
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,334
You've... I've got my phone if you need me.

1354
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,583
Okay.

1355
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,375
David:<i> I'm about to meet</i> <i>this man who's been</i>

1356
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:13,792
<i>such a threatening figure</i>

1357
01:18:13,834 --> 01:18:17,334
<i>in so many lives,</i> <i>including my own,</i>

1358
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:22,250
<i>and I have simply no idea</i> <i>what to expect.</i>

1359
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,208
- Dylan: He's coming out. - David: Mr. D'Amato.

1360
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:53,792
- Hi, it's Dave Farrier. - D'Amato: How are you?

1361
01:18:53,834 --> 01:18:55,500
David: Hey, how are you?

1362
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:58,459
D'Amato: I don't like being followed.

1363
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,375
David: I just wanted to talk to you briefly.

1364
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:03,750
- I don't want to talk to you. - If I could.

1365
01:19:04,792 --> 01:19:07,541
Because I was just... I'm just worried about...

1366
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,125
the legal letters you've sent me,

1367
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:13,708
and I just wanted to know if we could

1368
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,334
just talk about it face-to-face.

1369
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:18,459
D'Amato: There is a legal issue about me suing you right now.

1370
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,500
David: Is there?

1371
01:19:20,917 --> 01:19:23,125
D'Amato: Yes, you're in this country on a tourist visa.

1372
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:26,625
by doing anything related to so-called journalism.

1373
01:19:26,667 --> 01:19:29,292
you're in violation of the federal law here.

1374
01:19:29,334 --> 01:19:30,459
and you won't be back for a long time.

1375
01:19:31,917 --> 01:19:33,167
I'm on a journalism visa, so I'm, I'm okay to be here.

1376
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:34,834
I'm okay to be here. But I just...

1377
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:37,167
Well, we're going to let INS see about that.

1378
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:38,917
Could we just talk a little bit about--

1379
01:19:38,959 --> 01:19:40,000
You shouldn't be doing that.

1380
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:42,250
I just wanted to find out what's going on.

1381
01:19:42,292 --> 01:19:43,625
D'Amato: There's nothing that's going on.

1382
01:19:43,667 --> 01:19:47,250
Because the last heard I was gonna be in a US court

1383
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:48,459
and a New Zealand court,

1384
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,417
And you... and you may be...

1385
01:19:50,917 --> 01:19:51,708
And I really just wanted to sort this out face-to-face.

1386
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:52,834
D'Amato: You may be.

1387
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:54,083
And I just want to sort of...

1388
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:55,500
I mean, I'm not here to antagonize.

1389
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,625
I just genuinely want to be able to help out.

1390
01:19:57,667 --> 01:19:59,167
D'Amato: I would say you come quite a distance...

1391
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:00,250
quite a distance to antagonize.

1392
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:02,292
Well, you did say you were gonna sue me.

1393
01:20:02,334 --> 01:20:04,208
and I just wanna sort this issue out.

1394
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:05,541
(engine starts)

1395
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:07,959
D'Amato: I will see you at the right venue, believe me.

1396
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,541
Could you contact me if possible?

1397
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:36,334
David:<i> I went away feeling numb.</i>

1398
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:40,125
<i>D'Amato was calm, going</i> <i>instantly to legal threats,</i>

1399
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:44,459
<i>which is what he's always done,</i> <i>I suppose, as Terri,</i>

1400
01:20:44,917 --> 01:20:46,334
<i>as Jane,</i>

1401
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,208
<i>as himself.</i>

1402
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:57,667
<i>But after all this, I still</i> <i>couldn't help but wonder</i>

1403
01:20:57,708 --> 01:20:59,667
<i>were we totally certain that</i> <i>D'Amato</i>

1404
01:20:59,708 --> 01:21:03,292
<i>really was Jane and Debbie?</i> <i>Could we be wrong?</i>

1405
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,792
<i>So we went back to</i> <i>where it all started,</i>

1406
01:21:06,834 --> 01:21:08,292
<i>those 300 domain names</i>

1407
01:21:08,334 --> 01:21:11,167
<i>connected to</i> <i>the Nederdietsen group.</i>

1408
01:21:13,541 --> 01:21:16,208
<i>And that's when things</i> <i>went a little crazy.</i>

1409
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,250
<i>On one of those</i> <i>domain names</i>

1410
01:21:18,292 --> 01:21:20,500
<i>there was</i> <i>just a directory listing,</i>

1411
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:23,625
<i>Including a folder called</i> <i>"My Documents".</i>

1412
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:28,667
<i>It looks like D'Amato</i> <i>has accidently</i>

1413
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:32,083
<i>made hundreds of his</i> <i>private files public</i>

1414
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:33,541
<i>on the Internet.</i>

1415
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:40,708
<i>There's D'Amato's signature</i>

1416
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:43,792
<i>on a Nederdietsen</i> <i>registration form.</i>

1417
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:49,417
<i>There's also a contract with</i> <i>the investigation company</i>

1418
01:21:49,459 --> 01:21:51,083
<i>he hired to look into us.</i>

1419
01:21:51,541 --> 01:21:53,417
<i>The address is exactly the same</i>

1420
01:21:53,459 --> 01:21:55,750
<i>as the address used by</i> <i>Jane O'Brien Media</i>

1421
01:21:55,792 --> 01:21:59,041
<i>when booking rooms at the</i> <i>Hilton in New Zealand.</i>

1422
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,834
<i>Then there are documents</i> <i>and signatures</i>

1423
01:22:03,875 --> 01:22:06,708
<i>for Debbie Kuhn</i> <i>and Jane O'Brien...</i>

1424
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,334
<i>who's also got her</i> <i>own credit card.</i>

1425
01:22:12,334 --> 01:22:13,750
<i>And it turns out that D'Amato</i>

1426
01:22:13,792 --> 01:22:16,167
<i>did finally</i> <i>get that law degree,</i>

1427
01:22:16,208 --> 01:22:19,334
<i>from Hofstra University</i> <i>in 2011.</i>

1428
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:24,334
<i>He's also been telling the boys</i> <i>to enter the United States</i>

1429
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:27,541
<i>on a tourist visa,</i> <i>even though they're working.</i>

1430
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:30,459
<i>And it's finally clear to me</i>

1431
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:33,041
<i>how he funds</i> <i>his tickling empire.</i>

1432
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:36,667
<i>As of late 2012,</i>

1433
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:40,000
<i>he had almost six million</i> <i>in his checking account.</i>

1434
01:22:40,959 --> 01:22:44,000
<i>And his living expenses were</i> <i>being paid by a trust</i>

1435
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:46,083
<i>established by his father.</i>

1436
01:22:49,334 --> 01:22:52,208
<i>He also inherited millions from</i> <i>his mother's estate</i>

1437
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:54,417
<i>when she died in 2014.</i>

1438
01:22:56,875 --> 01:22:59,041
<i>It's all family money.</i>

1439
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:04,375
<i>There are also lots of emails</i>

1440
01:23:04,417 --> 01:23:06,917
<i>sent from Jane O'Brien's</i> <i>legal department.</i>

1441
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,834
<i>With this in mind, we call</i> <i>in to see Romeo Salta,</i>

1442
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:14,375
<i>The lawyer hired</i> <i>by Jane O'Brien Media</i>

1443
01:23:14,417 --> 01:23:16,959
<i>who's been sending us all</i> <i>the legal threats.</i>

1444
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:20,125
<i>We want to ask him about</i> <i>the correspondence</i>

1445
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:21,625
<i>his office has sent us.</i>

1446
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:24,417
David:<i> But I just thought</i> <i>you'd be curious to see...</i>

1447
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:27,334
<i>things been issued</i> <i>in LA County Court,</i>

1448
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:29,250
<i>that's signed off here</i> <i>with your name.</i>

1449
01:23:29,667 --> 01:23:32,667
<i>There's another example of that</i> <i>with that email address.</i>

1450
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:33,375
Romeo:<i> Yeah.</i>

1451
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:36,792
To that, as opposed to you. I mean, we got the one

1452
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:36,792
from you originally,

1453
01:23:36,834 --> 01:23:38,292
which we... It's fine. We don't need to talk about that.

1454
01:23:38,334 --> 01:23:40,000
It's very simple. I only sent one.

1455
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:41,125
Dylan: Yeah.

1456
01:23:41,167 --> 01:23:42,250
David: Yeah.

1457
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:43,750
- There's your answer. - Yeah.

1458
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:47,125
Romeo: I'll see what I can do to make those stop.

1459
01:23:47,167 --> 01:23:48,417
Have they stopped?

1460
01:23:49,917 --> 01:23:50,708
Dylan: Uh, we haven't heard anything for a little while.

1461
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:52,250
They're listing your address

1462
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:53,125
as their corporate headquarters, though.

1463
01:23:54,834 --> 01:23:56,834
- My address? - Yeah, if you look at...

1464
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:57,959
David: Your office.

1465
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,500
Dylan: janeobrienmedia.com,

1466
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:01,875
your address is listed as their corporate headquarters.

1467
01:24:01,917 --> 01:24:03,667
(sighs) Yeah, but it's not my--

1468
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:05,334
Dylan: No, no. On their website at the bottom.

1469
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,417
Romeo: But it's not, um...

1470
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,000
Dylan: I don't know if it's...

1471
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:10,208
It says "Office of Corporate Counsel

1472
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:11,708
and New York Headquarters."

1473
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:13,000
Romeo: Well, that's my address.

1474
01:24:13,041 --> 01:24:14,500
David: Yeah.

1475
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:17,583
- But it's not their... - It's crazy. But it's...

1476
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:20,208
Um, I mean, is this weird to you?

1477
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,459
That this person has taken on--

1478
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,041
It is. Of course, it's weird.

1479
01:24:28,334 --> 01:24:30,792
David:<i> Almost every legal letter</i> <i>we'd received from</i>

1480
01:24:30,834 --> 01:24:32,375
<i>from Salta was fake.</i>

1481
01:24:32,417 --> 01:24:35,083
<i>Like so many things</i> <i>connected to D'Amato,</i>

1482
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:36,500
<i>they were all just lies,</i>

1483
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:40,500
<i>lies to support his addiction</i> <i>to tickling videos.</i>

1484
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:47,250
<i>I started this journey curious</i> <i>about a bizarre sport</i>

1485
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:49,500
<i>called competitive</i> <i>endurance tickling,</i>

1486
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:53,541
<i>but I now think this was</i> <i>never even about tickling.</i>

1487
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:59,583
<i>This is about power,</i> <i>control and harassment.</i>

1488
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:02,334
<i>It's about one person's</i> <i>twistedness</i>

1489
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:04,417
<i>and how far that can go.</i>

1490
01:25:04,459 --> 01:25:07,417
<i>One person who's managed to</i> <i>shelter himself with money</i>

1491
01:25:07,459 --> 01:25:09,834
<i>to keep his obsession going.</i>

1492
01:25:10,375 --> 01:25:12,917
<i>But now it's his life exposed.</i>

1493
01:25:12,959 --> 01:25:15,708
<i>For once, it's him on camera.</i>

1494
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:22,375
<i>Before we leave America,</i>

1495
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:25,417
<i>there's one last phone call</i> <i>I want to make.</i>

1496
01:25:25,459 --> 01:25:27,541
<i>It's a name we found</i> <i>in the documents,</i>

1497
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:31,375
<i>one of David D'Amato's last</i> <i>surviving family members.</i>

1498
01:25:31,834 --> 01:25:33,000
(phone line rings)

1499
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:34,250
Dorothy:<i> Hello?</i>

1500
01:25:34,292 --> 01:25:37,083
- Oh, hi. Is that Dorothy? <i>- Yes.</i>

1501
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:38,959
Oh, hi. My name's David Farrier,

1502
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,083
I'm a journalist from New Zealand. How are you?

1503
01:25:42,583 --> 01:25:44,167
-<i> Okay.</i> - Yeah, good.

1504
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:45,875
Hey, sorry, it's probably a bit of a strange call

1505
01:25:45,917 --> 01:25:47,167
to receive out of the blue,

1506
01:25:47,417 --> 01:25:51,708
but I'm doing a story about, uh, David D'Amato.

1507
01:25:53,959 --> 01:25:57,375
-<i> Oh, in what way?</i> - Um...

1508
01:25:58,334 --> 01:26:00,459
He's been... It's the...

1509
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,834
He's sort of back to the tickling stuff again.

1510
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:04,500
<i>Oh, he is?</i>

1511
01:26:04,541 --> 01:26:08,041
- Yeah, he is. <i>- Oh, God!</i>

1512
01:26:09,041 --> 01:26:11,375
<i>Well, I will tell you that,</i>

1513
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:15,292
<i>um, I have no contact</i> <i>with him at all.</i>

1514
01:26:16,459 --> 01:26:19,083
I mean, did you think all this had sort of come to an end?

1515
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:21,667
<i>I did think, of course,</i> <i>it came to an end,</i>

1516
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:25,417
<i>because he served time,</i> <i>which I'm sure you know.</i>

1517
01:26:25,459 --> 01:26:26,417
Mm.

1518
01:26:26,459 --> 01:26:28,750
<i>But I don't understand, um...</i>

1519
01:26:30,959 --> 01:26:34,250
<i>I don't understand why he</i> <i>went back to doing this.</i>

1520
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:39,292
<i>I'm, like, in shock. How long</i> <i>has he been doing this?</i>

1521
01:26:41,041 --> 01:26:42,708
It's never stopped.

1522
01:26:47,292 --> 01:26:49,834
<i>I think he has a</i> <i>split personality.</i>

1523
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:53,541
<i>He's like that fine line</i> <i>between genius and insanity.</i>

1524
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:59,917
<i>I don't know if he's gay</i> <i>or he's asexual,</i>

1525
01:26:59,959 --> 01:27:03,625
<i>but he's never had a girlfriend</i> <i>that I ever knew of.</i>

1526
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:07,625
<i>I asked my husband once, um,</i>

1527
01:27:07,667 --> 01:27:10,792
<i>if he would be upset if</i> <i>he found out he was gay.</i>

1528
01:27:10,834 --> 01:27:15,792
<i>And he said that he would be</i> <i>upset but he would get over it.</i>

1529
01:27:15,834 --> 01:27:17,375
<i>But he was an only child,</i>

1530
01:27:17,417 --> 01:27:20,417
<i>and, you know, he wanted</i> <i>grandchildren.</i>

1531
01:27:22,834 --> 01:27:26,250
<i>He had a very,</i> <i>very strange childhood.</i>

1532
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:31,583
<i>The kids used to make</i> <i>fun of him all the time.</i>

1533
01:27:31,625 --> 01:27:34,250
<i>And she used to...</i> <i>She... His mother.</i>

1534
01:27:34,292 --> 01:27:36,375
<i>He was very close</i> <i>to his mother.</i>

1535
01:27:36,875 --> 01:27:39,500
<i>And his mother was very</i> <i>protective of him.</i>

1536
01:27:39,541 --> 01:27:44,792
<i>She never let him ride a bike</i> <i>or go skiing or do anything</i>

1537
01:27:44,834 --> 01:27:47,375
<i>because she was always afraid</i> <i>that he would get hurt.</i>

1538
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:49,541
<i>And from what I understand,</i>

1539
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:51,334
<i>the kids used to come around</i> <i>the house,</i>

1540
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:52,792
<i>and they used to</i> <i>make fun of him.</i>

1541
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:56,625
<i>And once they locked him</i> <i>in a locker in school.</i>

1542
01:28:00,417 --> 01:28:02,250
<i>And, you know,</i> <i>he was a teacher...</i>

1543
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:05,375
<i>and they threw him</i> <i>out of school.</i>

1544
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:07,708
<i>You know, I was afraid of him,</i>

1545
01:28:08,167 --> 01:28:13,334
<i>because I'm alone and, um...</i> <i>Yeah, I was afraid of him.</i>

1546
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:16,708
<i>So, you know,</i> <i>I'm afraid of him.</i>
