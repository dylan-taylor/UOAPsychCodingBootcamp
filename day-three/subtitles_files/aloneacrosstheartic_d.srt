00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:15,118
My name's Adam Shoalts.
I'm a writer and an explorer.

3
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:18,538
And my dream is to try to cross
nearly 4000 kilometers

4
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:21,291
of Canada's Arctic
wilderness alone.

5
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,669
As far as anyone knows this has
never been attempted before,

6
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:28,131
probably because no one was
stupid enough to try it.

7
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,890
<i>It's a very Canadian
approach I have, you know,</i>

8
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:42,604
<i>just coming out here skating around by myself as a way to train.</i>

9
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:47,358
<i>My first playground was the forests that surrounded my family home.</i>

10
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:49,611
<i>I mean that's where I grew up,
I grew up in the woods.</i>

11
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:53,781
<i>All around us where we lived,
we were in a really small town, was forest.</i>

12
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:57,160
<i>So with my dog and my brother,
we would always be out in those woods</i>

13
00:01:57,243 --> 00:02:02,957
<i>building shelters and making fire without matches and catching frogs.</i>

14
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:06,878
<i>And my father,
he would encourage us and he taught us all the different trees</i>

15
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:10,673
<i>and how to build birch bark
canoes and cedar strip canoes.</i>

16
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:13,843
<i>And that's where I really fell
in love with the natural world</i>

17
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,262
<i>and just came to really
appreciate it.</i>

18
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:19,265
<i>I mean I think it's so important
that we preserve it.</i>

19
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:22,602
<i>And that's always been a big
part of who I am and...</i>

20
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:25,688
<i>And why I do these
expeditions and these journeys</i>

21
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:28,816
<i>because I feel like that's the
most important thing there is,</i>

22
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,860
<i>is this natural world
and we try to preserve it.</i>

23
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:33,613
When I zoom in
on the satellite imagery,

24
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:38,409
I measure all the exact distances so I will know exactly like, well,

25
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:43,790
okay, I've got, you know,
27 kilometers to go this stage where I want to get to

26
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:47,251
or, you know,
13-kilometer portage here.

27
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:51,756
But to get
an actual topographic map,

28
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,968
I'm using a Garmin BaseCamp
over here on this laptop

29
00:02:56,052 --> 00:03:00,473
and I'm copying my route manually from the satellite imagery

30
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:05,144
on to the topographic maps here
and then I can download...

31
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,774
Download the topographic maps onto this little device here,
the GPS,

32
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,859
and carry with...
This with me in the field.

33
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:19,283
The winner is Adam Shoalts!

34
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,750
Nice.

35
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,796
- Can you recall the price?
- Yeah, it was 1,800.

36
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:15,589
This is good.

37
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:21,512
<i>And I want something
super tough,</i>

38
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:26,350
<i>durable that can withstand all the punishment
that the Arctic can dish out to itself.</i>

39
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:26,118
The polar bears mostly stay on the seacoast
and they only come in land a little bit. So...

40
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:27,286
What about grizzly bear?

41
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,770
There's lots of grizzlies, but
I figure I can take a grizzly.

42
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,834
You could take one? With what?

43
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,293
My bayonet.

44
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:36,745
You think I should take a gun?

45
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:38,923
Something more than a bayonet.

46
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:41,819
- I got a bear spray...
- Or... or... yeah, bear spray.

47
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:44,554
Yeah, you're gonna make yourself flavourful while he comes at you.

48
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:46,573
It's just that I have to travel
as light as possible

49
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,183
and the gun is cumbersome and it has to be kept protected,

50
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,744
it has to be
inside a waterproof case.

51
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:51,811
I showed you a small gun.

52
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,313
I'd be bringing a gun with me,
personally.

53
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,315
I know it's a lot of
work and everything but,

54
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,901
I don't know,
he's a... he's crazy not to.

55
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:02,196
I mean like polar bears,
everything, like, it can happen,

56
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,323
especially if they're hungry
this time of year.

57
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:07,410
So, he's definitely got like
a lot to undertake.

58
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:12,748
I have full confidence in his ability to be able to carry their sel.

59
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:18,838
But there are things out there
that see humans as a meal.

60
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,090
Especially in the part
of Canada he's going,

61
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:25,344
there's things that could stalk him for...
for multiple days and him not even know it.

62
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,972
The expedition that he's gonna
do now is gonna be very tough.

63
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:33,936
There's a lot of unknowns and it's a long
distance and he has got a lot of gear to carry,

64
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,854
it's very tough.

65
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:38,524
I would say there's only a small percentage
of people that probably could do it,

66
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:42,528
especially doing it alone,
that makes it even harder.

67
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:46,616
When you talk about an expedition that's gonna span several months,

68
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:52,663
several thousand kilometers,
how could you not look at it by asking the question,

69
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:55,708
"Is it possible?
Will he be able to do it?"

70
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,296
So, I know he has his
determination working for him.

71
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:04,383
I think he has that advantage
over top of anyone else.

72
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:07,970
I'm nowhere near as nervous
as my mom, I can tell you that.

73
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:09,639
I'll sleep fine at night.

74
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:11,891
I have quite
a confidence about it.

75
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:17,939
I won't be as near nervous as my dad who
will be slightly less nervous than my mom,

76
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:22,735
but I'll be nervous thinking about it and
hope for the best because, realistically,

77
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:27,239
it's like tackling the near
impossible.

78
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:30,618
But, yeah, like his dream is my
mom's worst nightmare.

79
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,704
Super-lightweight, but I'm doing a bent-shaft 12-degree one,

80
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:37,708
so it's a little more efficient for flat water
and this will be for white-water rapids.

81
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:41,754
I don't know if this is gonna be enough Gorilla Tape.
I'm gonna go to buy a second.

82
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,089
Which canoe are you taking?

83
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:47,885
Fifteen-foot solo, built for me by Nova Craft,
weighs 53 pounds.

84
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:51,597
Middle is tough stuff,
super hard.

85
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,784
You can hit it with a sledgehammer and it won't break...

86
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,434
If you don't make
it back, can I have it?

87
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,518
Yep.

88
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,228
I don't think he's gonna have the anxiety that
most people would probably have out there.

89
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,815
I think he's done enough of these and
he's gotten out of his comfort zone.

90
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,609
It's just gonna be
a very long trip.

91
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,486
So that'll be new for him.

92
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,490
<i>But I think he's
going to be able to break it up</i>

93
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,784
<i>into mentally shorter trips...</i>

94
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,953
A month here, a month there.

95
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:59,206
So I don't think he's looking at
it as one big long trip.

96
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,834
I think he's breaking
it down into his mind

97
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:05,755
as a series of smaller trips and
smaller accomplishments.

98
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:09,800
I think that's how you get past
the... the five-month issue

99
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:12,595
being out there by yourself.

100
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,805
When you see the design that no
one talks about.

101
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,392
The... it's like kind of more on the back of your head,
more on the side.

102
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:21,520
So I like them better than last
year. It's just all sanded.

103
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:25,149
It's like unbelievable.
You can have a beach picnic there, right?

104
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,193
They called it Sandy Creek for
obvious reasons.

105
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,755
But it turns out that that's not
why they call this Sandy Creek.

106
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:33,991
I was... my... my eye was burning,
so I just... the only water...

107
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,595
- Here is Dawson City.
- Okay.

108
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:40,456
Coming down the Klondike Highway and
then if we were going east on the Klondike

109
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:45,669
and we were going up the Dempster through
Tombstone Territorial Park through here.

110
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,630
What I've kind of done is I've taken all these historical accounts

111
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:15,509
<i>and stitched them together into
one big epic journey.</i>

112
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:19,305
<i>And no one knows if it's really possible to do it all in a single season.</i>

113
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,767
You could do it maybe if you spread it out over several years.

114
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:27,897
But it's gonna be a race against time to
see if I can squeeze it all into one year.

115
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,441
<i>I mean my
first wilderness trip by myself,</i>

116
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,444
<i>I was only 13 years old and I
was terrified all night long.</i>

117
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:39,283
But, you know, 18 years later of
wilderness adventure,

118
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:44,038
you... you get into the rhythm of things and
you start to feel much more comfortable.

119
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,831
So now when I look
at on that wilderness,

120
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:48,334
I don't see an alien foreign
environment,

121
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,960
I see something
that looks like home.

122
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,921
So, you know, I'm in my element.

123
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,840
<i>There's nowhere I'd rather be in
the world than right here.</i>

124
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,066
SOS.

125
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,652
Thank you.

126
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,117
This is the send-off, I suppose.

127
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,120
Long time coming.

128
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:30,417
Yeah. It's... this expedition has been three years in the making,
at least three years.

129
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,230
So it's been a long time coming
to get up to the Arctic Circle

130
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:37,424
and now I'm finally here and all these years of planning and preparing

131
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:41,345
and dreaming and visualizing has
culminated in this moment.

132
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,847
So, we'll see
how it goes from here.

133
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:44,848
Godspeed.

134
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,600
Thank you for all
your support, Chuck.

135
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:47,726
Yeah.

136
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:52,606
It's been a blast having you here as part of the expedition support.
So, that was awesome.

137
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,607
So honoured to help.

138
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:56,652
Oh, well,
I'm honoured to have you and everyone else here.

139
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,237
So, very good.

140
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,948
What a contrast from
the days when it was just me.

141
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:05,119
I mean I guess I'm gonna get to
that pretty soon. Okay.

142
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:17,733
So I mean look at the size of
that. I mean it's massive.

143
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,652
Going off in that direction.

144
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:27,159
So, bear crap and bears
on the road here.

145
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:30,079
And the road can give you
a false sense of security.

146
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:33,707
I mean you think it's a little outpost to civilization,
but it's not really.

147
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,460
I mean, the grizzly is... they
just walk right on them.

148
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,004
They do their
business on the road.

149
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,549
And probably coming down from
those mountains there.

150
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,364
And it kind of
makes me want to keep, you know,

151
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:50,140
one eye over my shoulder
as I do this hike.

152
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,480
I feel like I could almost be in one of those post-apocalyptic movies

153
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,274
<i>and everything is just
desolate and barren</i>

154
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:04,988
<i>and I'm like one of the last people left alive
on Earth looking out on this landscape.</i>

155
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,649
Here is my canoe fully loaded

156
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:46,405
and ready to set off on my
journey across the Arctic.

157
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:50,200
This canoe and I are about to become very
good friends and very close companion.

158
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:56,123
<i>If I'm to cross the Arctic,</i>

159
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:01,253
<i>I have no choice but to travel up river on many of these waterways</i>

160
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,339
<i>because they're flowing north
out to the Arctic Ocean</i>

161
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:07,176
<i>and I have to go east if
I'm to cross the Arctic.</i>

162
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,844
<i>It's a matter of necessity.</i>

163
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,809
The vast Mackenzie River.

164
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,189
Over two kilometers wide,
sometimes three kilometers wide.

165
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,235
Way down there is my canoe.
Who wants to be my pole?

166
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:37,080
<i>My main strategy for getting upriver was
kind of hauling along the bottom a bit</i>

167
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:41,502
<i>like they do on those boats in Venice,
gondola I think they call them.</i>

168
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,379
<i>So that's my... that's my style,
it's very romantic,</i>

169
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:47,799
<i>I like to think, as I pull my
way up the Mackenzie River.</i>

170
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:51,094
I may be doing this journey alone but in reality I could never do it

171
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:55,724
without the support of people like Chuck, Mark,
my family, the crew.

172
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,144
I mean they've all been terrific
and it's just... I mean it's...

173
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:02,272
It's really an overwhelming feeling having done expeditions for years

174
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:05,901
on a shoestring budget all by myself not having anyone to support me.

175
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,819
I mean saying thanks
doesn't seem adequate.

176
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:11,406
But it's just a really nice feeling knowing that there are people out there

177
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,409
who are rooting for me,
who are cheering for me, supporting me.

178
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,871
And without that...
without their support I really couldn't do it. That's the truth.

179
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:21,875
Yeah, I got my stuff up here,
satellite phone, first-aid kit,

180
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,961
bear spray, air horn.

181
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:28,257
These are my little accoutrements of weapons,
air bangers over there.

182
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,801
My pillow,
I just take my clothes and I...

183
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,719
You know, socks,
dirty socks and things

184
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:36,682
and I stick them inside my
sleeping bag case

185
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,142
and that's my pillow and I... you
know, I love that pillow.

186
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,310
So friggin' comfy.

187
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,772
Look at the remains of
that massive blister down there

188
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,608
from hiking along
the Dempster Highway.

189
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:53,740
I think my dreams of becoming a foot model
have pretty much been decisively ended now.

190
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:57,536
It's pretty cold but there's...
there's no really no other option right now.

191
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,413
I've got to
wade across this mud flat.

192
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,290
So I just took my boots
and my socks off.

193
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,918
I've rolled up my pants.
It's kind of like quicksand.

194
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:10,090
It's pretty cold but didn't seem to be any other option.
So here we go.

195
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:34,031
There's the grizzly track.
There's another one up here.

196
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:37,326
Imagine if I am just pulling
along and the bank gives way

197
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,412
and... and just smacks into my canoe and sends me into the river,

198
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:44,791
probably from the melting of the
permafrost and the ice breakup.

199
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,009
It's really quite strange though
coming along this section

200
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:57,971
I got a bit of a chill like you get in the grocery
store when you go on the frozen food aisle.

201
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:02,100
That's kind of what it feels like with all these mounds of ice here.

202
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:07,314
You know a bit of a chill coming off it as
they go along all this dirty ice that's melting.

203
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:21,662
There's nothing quite like the smell of wet socks drying in your tent.

204
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:38,387
It's 2:30 a.m. and I was asleep and
something woke me up outside the tent.

205
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,557
There was a noise and it sounded like a
big animal crashing through the woods.

206
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:43,475
So I started yelling.

207
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,953
That's what you normally do if there's a bear outside the tent,

208
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:46,977
like "Hey, hey, hey."

209
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,480
So I scared it off.

210
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,315
And I could hear
something crashing.

211
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,151
So I unzipped the tent
and looked out,

212
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:57,322
grabbed my little air horn and I
went to squeeze it.

213
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,827
It just made the hissing noise.
So the thing doesn't work.

214
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,541
So I thought it was a bear but then I looked again and it wasn't a bear,

215
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,001
it was a giant male muskoxen.

216
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:14,297
A muskoxen just outside my tent
in the bushes over there.

217
00:20:56,631 --> 00:21:00,427
This is my '80s rock star hair
look right now.

218
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,597
My toe looks kind of messed up
and it bled a little today.

219
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:09,436
And I'm about to leave behind the familiar
that is the Mackenzie River over there,

220
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,897
and head into the unknown.

221
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:17,569
This new waterway leads
east into the forest.

222
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,499
One thing I don't pack on
expeditions are towels.

223
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:35,003
So I'm just gonna have to air
dry and shake like a dog.

224
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,006
It's moving a little bit.

225
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,759
Dude, check out what it is.

226
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,971
I have to head that way anyways,
but I'm gonna stay a bit far bank for safety.

227
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,727
It's best not to disturb them.

228
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:58,276
I'd only been asleep for about an hour and
twenty minutes and I heard a noise outside.

229
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,194
I woke up.

230
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,112
And, thankfully,
I'm a light sleeper

231
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:04,658
'cause I heard something in the
bushes and I heard the noise,

232
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,577
and, instinctively,
when I hear a noise outside my tent I start yelling.

233
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,996
So if it is a bear, hopefully,
I scared it away.

234
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,999
And I quickly unzipped the screen door,
poked my head out

235
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,461
and I saw something move in the bushes
and sure enough it was a black bear.

236
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:18,898
I don't know
if you can see it there.

237
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,299
I propped my canoe up
alongside of the tent

238
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,677
to create like one side of a
barrier and, thankfully,

239
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,531
I did 'cause the black bear was just
on the other side in the bushes there.

240
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:30,308
I started yelling at it in my most menacing and intimidating manner

241
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:35,021
and smacking the paddle on the canoe
making as much noise as possible,

242
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:39,484
<i>and, eventually, he walked off,
he didn't run.</i>

243
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:44,489
<i>He walked along the edge of the bushes there down the shoreline.</i>

244
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:49,452
<i>And I've continued to make noise.
But I don't know how far he went.</i>

245
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,196
<i>The more I've gone up this river
and the more I've explored it,</i>

246
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,975
<i>the more I feel the...
I started to wonder about that old 1972 government report on the river.</i>

247
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,812
<i>It described the landscape that the river flows through as, quote,</i>

248
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,106
"Subdued and gently rolling."

249
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:23,945
And I don't know about you but I wouldn't
describe that as subdued or gently rolling hills.

250
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,948
I mean that's a pretty
spectacular peak right there.

251
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:30,619
There's this vertical cliff that
rises beside the river.

252
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,078
That's pretty awesome.

253
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,253
Mosquitoes are getting bad.

254
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:43,381
It's never a nice feeling when you wake up and you see just,
you know,

255
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:48,803
hundreds of mosquitoes just waiting for
you the second you'll unzip the screen door

256
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:50,639
to come attack you.

257
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,265
Looking pretty nasty.

258
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:55,018
The nail is gonna fall off.

259
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,271
But that's okay.

260
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:02,817
And my... my fingers have become
incredibly sore, I think,

261
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,654
from gripping the pole so hard.

262
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:09,616
It really... it's really sore
when I go like this with them.

263
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,012
Yes, my toenail has fallen off

264
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:35,684
and I used an alcohol wipe on
that and cleaned it up a bit.

265
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,062
This morning is officially the
first day of summer

266
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:44,317
but it actually feels colder today than it's been the last several weeks.

267
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:50,115
And I had a pretty good night sleep on this beach here except,
you know,

268
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:53,868
you never really sleep that soundly because
there's always noises in the wilderness.

269
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:58,206
Like right now off to my left somewhere I can hear a baby beaver crying

270
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:02,961
and there's geese
that honk and birds that chirp

271
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,713
throughout the night.

272
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:08,383
And sometimes, like a few nights ago,
there's a bear that will wake you up...

273
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:13,888
<i>A bear woke me up at least...
when it's walking through the brush or, you know,</i>

274
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:19,102
<i>you hear a muskoxen rumble or all kinds
of things like that will wake you up.</i>

275
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:23,857
But I guess, eventually,
you just kind of get used to it.

276
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,776
<i>That wolf yesterday,
that white one on the bank,</i>

277
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,281
actually that was the most
curious wolf I've ever seen.

278
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:35,618
He actually looked at me for quite a long time and,
you know, he walked along the bank.

279
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,746
It was almost like seeing a
domesticated dog.

280
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:42,083
The... the look in his eyes,
the way that he stared at me and our eyes met;

281
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:45,712
we looked at each other and I
filmed him and I was just...

282
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,840
It was almost like having a friend in the wilderness seeing that wolf.

283
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,092
It was just such a nice moment.

284
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:01,352
This area has been burnt out
before from a forest fire

285
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:04,564
but there is really high cliffs
over there.

286
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,193
And the river,
the Hare Indian River here

287
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:11,488
is getting quite small and
hemmed in by willow bushes

288
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:14,991
on either side
as I near the headwaters.

289
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:27,337
There is just not a lot of vitamin C in granola bars and dehydrated foods

290
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,049
but there is something I can do
pretty easily to remedy that

291
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:34,761
and make sure I don't get scurvy
from lack of vitamin C,

292
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:39,682
which is to take... let me show you here...
take some of the spruce...

293
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:46,481
Take some of the spruce needles which is
loaded with vitamin C and throw that in my pot,

294
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,983
<i>boil some water
and make spruce tea.</i>

295
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:53,988
<i>They say that, you know,
spruce tea has more vitamin C in it than orange juice.</i>

296
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,825
<i>So that's pretty good.
And I don't have to worry about getting scurvy.</i>

297
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:16,154
It's a real disheartening sight
behind me here.

298
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:20,617
The river that I'm following pretty much just disappears into that morass.

299
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:25,830
And there's no question I'm not gonna
be able to drag the canoe through there.

300
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,457
I'm gonna have to
portage everything,

301
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,170
which is not gonna be easy considering it's
just like a foul morass of swamp and muskeg.

302
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,298
But I think I'm almost
at the next lake,

303
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:40,345
so I just got to tell myself that and try
to find the mental stamina to push on.

304
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,817
Well, I followed the river for as long as I possibly could,
the Hare Indian River.

305
00:28:54,901 --> 00:29:00,198
My gear is behind me here,
but there's pretty much nothing left of it, just this ditch.

306
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:21,844
The current is clearly flowing that way and that puts a smile on my face

307
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:25,640
for very important reason
because that means, you know,

308
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:29,352
all the water I have encountered so far
has been flowing the other direction

309
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:32,855
it's been flowing west,
but this is flowing east.

310
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:34,190
And because it's flowing east,

311
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:39,988
that means I have crossed the divide
between the Mackenzie River watershed

312
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:42,365
<i>and Great Bear Lake over here.</i>

313
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:15,773
<i>I'm the only person on the whole
lake all to my lonesome.</i>

314
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:20,069
And some caves way up there on
the mountain slopes.

315
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:23,281
And when I see
a cave on a mountain,

316
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:27,035
my imagination always goes to
strange places and I imagine

317
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:29,454
what manner of creature
might live up there.

318
00:30:54,604 --> 00:31:00,109
It is 4:24 p.m. on June 25th and I
have just reached

319
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:01,736
Great Bear Lake.

320
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,364
This is a big achievement
for me.

321
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,575
It's a new chapter in
the expedition.

322
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,453
It's like I've reached a new level,
a new phase of the journey.

323
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:15,375
I've got the accumulating
scrapes and bruises.

324
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,293
Nice bruise.

325
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:23,049
My lovely fiancée has made these super helpful labels for me because,

326
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:26,427
believe it or not,
despite the fact that I am filming this entire documentary,

327
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:28,679
I'm not very good with
technology.

328
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:34,394
So she labeled everything like "unplug as soon as charging is done."

329
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:39,482
"Plug this end into the solar panel."
"Charge battery pack." It's very helpful.

330
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:40,566
She labeled everything.

331
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:46,614
I just came around the corner here and this is what made my heart sank.

332
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:50,618
There's just nothing but ice as
far as the eye can see.

333
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:56,582
And it's a lot of ice and it's gonna slow
my progress right down to a crawl.

334
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,668
There's just so
much ice out there.

335
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:03,756
Melting ice floes out there
that's blocked up my passage

336
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,008
along the coast
of Great Bear Lake.

337
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,136
So, there's nothing
I can do about it.

338
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:12,640
I started at 3:30 a.m. and I'm operating on only three hours of sleep.

339
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,977
I paddled 41 kilometers
today on three hours of sleep.

340
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,521
So I've made my camp
on this beach.

341
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,731
Try to get
as comfortable as I can.

342
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:22,650
I'm gonna have a fire
in a second.

343
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:25,862
And just hope
that when I wake up,

344
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:29,782
this ice will be out of here
and I can continue.

345
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,160
3:12 a.m.,

346
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:36,789
and I am about to set off through the ice here on Great Bear Lake.

347
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,262
<i>It's entirely possible I'm the only person on this entire vast body of water</i>

348
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:36,349
<i>paddling right now,
especially since it's still icy.</i>

349
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:40,728
Out there I can't make it any
further along Great Bear Lake,

350
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:43,439
it's just my route
is blocked by ice.

351
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,191
All right team, listen up.

352
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:51,906
Mr. Canoe, Mr. Blue Barrel, Paddles, everyone,
I need your attention.

353
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,574
Backpack.

354
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:57,286
Now we are going to be patient
and we are gonna wait

355
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:02,208
until the ice melts out there
and then we can continue.

356
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:06,128
So today is a
lesson in patience.

357
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:09,674
I know like me you're eager and
you want to push on,

358
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,467
but it's
just too much of a risk.

359
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:16,305
If we get stranded in that ice again and then the wind picks up,

360
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:20,434
it could take us way out into the heart of
the lake and that would be extremely bad.

361
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:23,354
So, team, I'm proud of the work
we've done together,

362
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:27,567
but right now we've got to try to be
patient and just wait for that ice to melt.

363
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,027
It seems like I'm not the first
person to become stranded

364
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:33,406
on this island here in the
center of the island.

365
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,784
Looks like long time ago

366
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,870
someone once had a campfire here

367
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:43,666
because these four rocks look
like they've been placed here

368
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:48,504
and in the center of the rocks
there's some very old bones,

369
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:52,883
some animal bones or somebody
cooked something.

370
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:58,139
<i>So somebody else maybe was
stranded on this island, too.</i>

371
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:13,904
You know if I follow it maybe
I'll find a pot of gold.

372
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:19,285
Actually I would be more happy just to find open water and no ice.

373
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,996
I'll take that over the pot
of gold.

374
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,081
The longer I sit
waiting for ice to melt,

375
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:27,418
the less likely it becomes that I'll get all the way across the Arctic

376
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:31,922
and then I have to, you know, re-evaluate my goals,
what I'm gonna do on this journey.

377
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:21,472
<i>Still some pretty big ice floes out here,
but most of the ice has melted.</i>

378
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:23,307
Iceberg dead ahead.

379
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:24,684
Hard to starboard.

380
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,651
Now I'm just trapped
on a fog-bound coast here

381
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:36,028
and this one looks less inviting
than the other one.

382
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:39,281
I can see some swampy alder
bushes back in there.

383
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,618
There's a summer out here
in the woods.

384
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:45,496
I know that there's ruins
of Fort Confidence.

385
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:48,874
Fort Confidence was built almost
200 years ago

386
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,919
<i>as a fur trade
fort on Great Bear Lake</i>

387
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,796
<i>and there's not much
left of it today.</i>

388
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,257
<i>There's probably just
some stone foundations.</i>

389
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,677
But I'm gonna go off into those thick spruce trees over there

390
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,429
and see if I can find anything.

391
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:03,472
And I see something up there.

392
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:09,437
Looks like an old stone chimney just poking out of the...
the undergrowth of the forest.

393
00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:14,191
And the fort itself would have
been built out of spruce logs

394
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:17,570
cut right here, no doubt.

395
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:19,488
They just kind of
hacked through here.

396
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:24,034
It's a little bit eerie.

397
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,663
Kind of just seeing ruins in the
middle of nowhere

398
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:31,959
reminds you of the ghosts
of the past as it were.

399
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:37,548
That, you know,
hundreds of years ago there were explorers here before me.

400
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:40,593
Oh, wow, that's really neat.
Look at that.

401
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:43,804
You can see the masonry
work in there.

402
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:47,767
So this is a chimney. We got
some rocks down below.

403
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,978
Wow, that's actually quite neat.

404
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,314
A bit of wood
sticking out of it, too.

405
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:57,735
Everything else must have rotted away
and been swallowed up by the forest

406
00:37:58,444 --> 00:37:59,945
over the last 200 years.

407
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:02,531
These are granite rocks pulled
out of the lake shore there.

408
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:05,159
Oh, yeah, I can see straight up
the chimney.

409
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,411
I mean it's a little bit eerie
the ghosts of the past,

410
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:11,707
but it's also very fascinating
from a historical perspective

411
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:15,795
to think that hundreds of years ago this
forest here would have been cleared out

412
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:20,508
and they would have had a fort with cannons
and muskets and high wooden walls.

413
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:25,596
The river I'm trying to find is named after the
guy who was in charge of this fort, Dease.

414
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:28,474
So I'm looking for the
Dease River.

415
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,227
Well, let's get back
down to the canoe.

416
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,729
I don't like to leave my canoe
for too long.

417
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:37,441
I get...
we get kind of separation anxiety when we're apart.

418
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:42,071
So I tied it up down there on the water and I better get back to it.

419
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:45,616
He was really curious but then I
accidentally made a noise with my paddle.

420
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,743
He ran off, he got scared.

421
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:20,276
Poor sock just trying to get dry in the
sun and the bugs are just swarming up.

422
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,072
Somewhere out here in the forest

423
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:29,660
<i>should be the remains of Douglas' cabin from over a century ago.</i>

424
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,582
And I think I see it up here.

425
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,293
Yeah, I can see it now.

426
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:44,425
So just the parts of the walls are left but the roof has collapsed.

427
00:39:45,718 --> 00:39:48,637
In over a hundred years the
elements have done that to it.

428
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,390
There's the inside of the cabin.

429
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:55,769
And you can see over there in
the corner this was this...

430
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:58,397
This would have been its
fireplace over here.

431
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:02,318
I mean the preservation is pretty good in this cold environment, right.

432
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:06,655
It's a pretty dry environment despite the snow,
so things don't rot that well.

433
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:09,241
But in a hundred years the roof
has collapsed.

434
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:11,118
But there it is down in there.

435
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:13,354
So that would
have been his hearth,

436
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:16,749
very important for the long cold
Canadian winter.

437
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,084
And that's all
that remains of it.

438
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:22,046
You can see
the construction along the side.

439
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:26,258
And just very slowly the forest
is gonna swallow it up

440
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:31,931
and it'll vanish into the wilderness and there won't be anything left of it.

441
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:37,603
But now I got to get back to the canoe
and continue my own journey upriver.

442
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,749
<i>Last night when I was
setting up my tent,</i>

443
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:03,921
<i>I discovered there was a hole in it,
a little small hole in the screen here.</i>

444
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,506
And I was inside my
tent at the time

445
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:07,841
and I had nothing to patch it
with other than a bandage.

446
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:09,343
But now I've got my duct tape.

447
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:14,515
So I'm gonna make a little more
proper repair to the mesh there

448
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:18,894
so the bugs cannot find a way in and bite me in the middle of the night.

449
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:23,148
There's just unbelievable number
of those horse flies

450
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:25,609
on this beach
and all over the river.

451
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:30,155
You can see some...
there's just a bunch of them accumulating inside my tent

452
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,827
around... under the tent fly...
there's one right there... and they're big suckers.

453
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,956
And when they bite you, it feels
almost more like a bee sting.

454
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,376
And if you want to see
what it looks like,

455
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:48,298
it's like a welt where one got me right there on the shin today.

456
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,843
Another one bit me down there.

457
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:55,556
Millions of mosquitoes and black
flies just swarms of them

458
00:41:56,265 --> 00:42:00,853
all over the place down there on
my gear and just...

459
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:05,441
They're so bad that I'm just not even gonna brush my teeth this morning

460
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:10,070
because I can't take this bug net off to brush
my teeth with like millions of mosquitoes

461
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:11,739
buzzing all over the place.

462
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:12,990
<i>So I'm just gonna go.</i>

463
00:42:37,014 --> 00:42:39,975
The skies are dark and I can see
that a storm is coming,

464
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:42,686
so I want to batter down the
hatches and secure all the gear.

465
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:46,815
I had a quick fire,
made some herbal tea and some dinner really fast

466
00:42:46,899 --> 00:42:50,778
and I just threw my backpack under there on
my paddle and I'm gonna jump in the tent.

467
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:54,740
You don't want to be caught out
in the open in the storm.

468
00:42:54,823 --> 00:43:00,829
This tent's been pretty strong so far but this is the first real big test of it.

469
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:16,595
It's intensifying,
definitely intensifying.

470
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:21,683
You know there's something about
a storm alone in the wilderness.

471
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,454
It can get
on your nerves a little.

472
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:26,873
I've been through a heck of a lot of storms in the wilderness,

473
00:43:26,897 --> 00:43:28,941
like probably over 50 of them.

474
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:34,696
And you just have to wait it out
and try to... excuse me...

475
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,032
My tent is really flying around
all over the place.

476
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:40,035
Water coming off down there.

477
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,005
Oh.

478
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:13,318
I got this map to follow and I think this is the creek here that I'm on.

479
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:18,198
Then you go across the tundra here and through them the marshes

480
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:22,494
and then I'll see the lonely mountain and
I'm gonna head for that lonely mountain

481
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:24,872
and I have to cross some fields
of ice, but, eventually,

482
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:27,291
they'll take me over into the
Dismal Lakes.

483
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:30,627
I'm gonna hope to try to do this
in just three loads.

484
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:33,630
So if it's a 10-kilometer
portage one way,

485
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:38,302
I would take my big heavy pack
first, that's 20 kilometers...

486
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:40,554
10 kilometers there,
10 kilometers back.

487
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:44,808
Then I would go to this barrel which I've loaded fully right up to the brim.

488
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:46,810
It's gotta weigh close to
50 pounds.

489
00:44:46,894 --> 00:44:49,521
That would be another 10 kilometers there,
10 kilometers back.

490
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:52,524
So that
would be 20... 40 kilometers.

491
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:55,402
I'm gonna try to follow this
sand ridge to begin with.

492
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,738
I saw
some wolf tracks over here.

493
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:01,867
So it looks like the wolves use it as a
highway and I'm gonna do that as well.

494
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,120
Here's... here's
some faint wolf tracks.

495
00:45:05,204 --> 00:45:07,998
There's one down there and they
went that way.

496
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:09,666
So I'm gonna go that
way as well.

497
00:45:23,055 --> 00:45:27,809
About 10 kilometers from me and
that's it, the lonely mountain.

498
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:29,561
And that's
where I want to get to.

499
00:45:29,645 --> 00:45:33,273
And you can see the trail,
the drag marks where I dragged the canoe

500
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:39,279
all the way over there and across through
those trees several kilometers away.

501
00:45:40,364 --> 00:45:43,242
And sand and gravel seems a
little bit hard on the canoe,

502
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:45,165
but I don't really have a choice
at this point.

503
00:45:45,244 --> 00:45:48,705
I feel really privileged to be here right now amidst such beauty.

504
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:52,668
Maybe not so privileged when
there's hordes of black flies

505
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,586
and mosquitoes eating me alive.

506
00:45:54,670 --> 00:46:00,300
But this view is just magnificent and I'm really soaking it in right now

507
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:03,720
and looking forward to another
freeze-dried meal.

508
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:10,477
This canoe has been through the
ice, it's been over the rocks,

509
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,479
upriver, downriver, hauling,

510
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:15,649
paddling, it's taken a lot of
abuse but, you know,

511
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:20,904
fuss far there's no leaks and it's still...
still standing up to the rigors of this journey.

512
00:46:20,988 --> 00:46:26,702
So I just hope that so far so
good and that it stays that way.

513
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:47,097
And there they are.
At long last my first glimpse of the Dismal Lakes

514
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:50,600
and they don't look that
dismal to me from up here.

515
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:55,647
They look actually quite refreshing after this nightmarish portage

516
00:46:55,731 --> 00:46:59,568
with horrible bugs and marshes
and high hills.

517
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:02,112
So the Dismal Lakes look pretty
good from up here.

518
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:04,531
That's what I thought
of that book.

519
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:08,744
No sense in carrying any
extra weight than I need to.

520
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:11,371
Packing another book doesn't
make any sense.

521
00:47:11,455 --> 00:47:12,622
So there you go.

522
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:16,293
But for sentimental reasons I did actually...
I saved the cover.

523
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:18,086
I saved the cover,
I'm gonna keep that.

524
00:47:18,754 --> 00:47:23,133
My neck was massacred by black flies the other day on that portage.

525
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:26,511
I'll show you some of the bites if you can see them down in there.

526
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:29,681
And the black flies just love to
go for the neck.

527
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:36,188
And, yeah,
they've just bit me all over the place in there portaging.

528
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:39,816
<i>It's pretty cold night.
I don't mind that.</i>

529
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,112
I actually kind of like getting cozy inside my sleeping bag here

530
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:48,700
and huddling down with all my extra sweaters and blankets and things.

531
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:53,455
You can see the tent buckling
under the pressure.

532
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,876
You can hear the wind howling.

533
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:17,354
I created this rock wall on this side to cut down
on the wind rushing underneath the tent fly.

534
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:20,524
If nothing else,
it was creating a lot of noise and keeping me up at night.

535
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,903
It's not really anything
else I could do.

536
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:29,908
Everything is pretty exposed out
here by the Dismal Lakes.

537
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:36,748
So that's where
I'm headed... out there.

538
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,573
The longer the expedition
goes on,

539
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:56,828
the more my gear starts to suffer the effects of wear and tear

540
00:49:56,912 --> 00:50:00,916
and had a couple of holes in it up here and the fabric was coming out.

541
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,435
They look like they
have been burned,

542
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:05,170
singed by the fire but I don't know how because it's in my hood.

543
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:08,965
There's the other hole in my tent down
there that I patched with actual duct tape.

544
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:14,221
Wristband broke off of it,
so now I'm just using it as an old-fashioned pocket watch

545
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:15,764
that I keep in my pocket.

546
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:18,141
This busted off of it,
so I'm gonna try to repair that.

547
00:50:18,225 --> 00:50:21,394
Otherwise I don't have a bear
banger, which wouldn't be good.

548
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:26,775
You know after a month and a half or more,
two months almost, being out here,

549
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:30,362
my tent begins to feel like
home, like this is my home

550
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:35,200
and I'm really...
when I'm warm and dry in here and it's cold and wet outside

551
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:37,827
it just feels like the
greatest luxury in the world.

552
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:39,538
Feels like
a five-star hotel to me.

553
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:46,670
My path up the Coppermine is
blocked by a massive canyon.

554
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,588
It represents a huge obstacle.

555
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:53,927
I'm gonna have to do a really long portage
up over these tall cliffs to get around it.

556
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,971
So I've got all my gear here.

557
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:57,180
I've just prepped it.

558
00:50:57,264 --> 00:51:00,225
And I tied my hiking boots onto
the outside

559
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:03,746
because for the first one I've got to wear these
wading shoes which are bigger and heavy.

560
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:07,250
So I'm just gonna wear them,
leave them over there and then switch into the hiking boots.

561
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:11,152
I've got three loads to do...
The barrel, the backpack.

562
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:13,822
This barrel I've emptied,
so it's now empty.

563
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:19,619
And then, finally,
the canoe and it's gonna be hard because this is one heck of a canyon.

564
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:33,675
I come across a rather unexpected sight which is this monument.

565
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:37,220
In the last place on Earth you'd probably expect to see a monument.

566
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:40,140
It says David and Carol Jones
who loved the north

567
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:44,561
and its people were drowned in these rapids on August 14th 1972.

568
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:46,730
They respected
honesty and truth.

569
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:53,403
You know seeing that it's a very
solemn reminder of the hazards

570
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:55,739
involved in a wilderness
journey like this

571
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,534
and it's very touching.

572
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:06,291
I feel for them and their family
and want to take a moment

573
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:10,420
to pay my respects to
fellow wilderness travelers.

574
00:52:16,343 --> 00:52:21,806
Makes me want to be extra cautious because it's a reminder of,
you know,

575
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:27,187
what can go wrong with the
slightest mistake out here.

576
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:30,774
But that's what I'm portaging
around this big canyon.

577
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:34,903
<i>It was a pretty demoralizing
day, I have to say.</i>

578
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:39,240
It was just really brutally hard
labour all day long.

579
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:40,617
The bugs were awful.

580
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,745
And I knew coming into the
expedition that this phase

581
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:48,625
would be one of the most physically rigorous of the whole journey...

582
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,001
The Coppermine River,

583
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:54,547
which is just a big powerful river with
strong white-water rapids, waterfalls,

584
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:58,635
and canyons on it,
and that's why no one travels upriver on it.

585
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:00,845
But that's exactly what I'm
trying to do here.

586
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:05,100
And, you know, I put in a very
long 11 hours of travel

587
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:08,561
but I only made it about
12 or 13 kilometers upriver.

588
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:11,606
So that kind of took the wind
out of my sails.

589
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:14,442
And I mean you can
see the river right there.

590
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:17,570
Didn't have the great... best
camping place either

591
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:20,615
but you can see how strong the
current is in the river.

592
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:24,786
And... and I mean that's not even like a strong part,
that's just like the ordinary part.

593
00:53:25,662 --> 00:53:31,251
Hearne depicts this area and this is,
you know, 247 years ago,

594
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:36,631
as very windswept barren rocky tundra with not a lot of tree cover,

595
00:53:36,715 --> 00:53:39,426
maybe just some scattered spruce
here and there.

596
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:41,302
I mean there is
some trees but not many.

597
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:44,389
And that's also the impression I
got from the 1820 accounts

598
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:50,228
written by John Franklin and John Richardson,
two later British explorers.

599
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:55,900
And, yet, here we have, you know,
pretty large extensive spruce forests.

600
00:53:55,984 --> 00:53:58,194
And that makes you
wonder about things.

601
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,114
Is this the result of global
warming? Could be.

602
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:05,285
We know that the climate has been
warming since about the mid-19th century.

603
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:07,954
Don't quote me on that,
but I think that's about right.

604
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:11,207
Right, the Little Ice Age came to an end
and then the climate has been warming.

605
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:15,545
So, it's possible that over the past almost a quarter of a millennium,

606
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:18,840
it's a long time since Samuel
Hearne was here in human terms.

607
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:23,344
The forest has really grown up and there's
trees where there was never trees before

608
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:26,222
because the climate is warming.

609
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:30,477
So it's been 55 days since I
left the Arctic Circle,

610
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:33,354
longer
since I started camping though.

611
00:54:34,022 --> 00:54:35,899
It's cold but refreshing.

612
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:15,480
Every night I have a little
ritual that I do inside my tent.

613
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:19,776
It's called kill all the black flies that come inside the tent with me.

614
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:23,238
And if you can hear
that gentle pitter-patter,

615
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:26,825
it's not the sound of rain
against my tent fly.

616
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:30,537
It's sound of hundreds of black
flies against it

617
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:34,958
as they get trapped under the
fly and they try to escape.

618
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:38,211
But some of them
get inside here with me.

619
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:43,842
No matter how quick, no matter how nimble I am,
when I dive through the tent door,

620
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:45,885
some of them come inside.

621
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,305
My toe is still pretty swollen
and busted up.

622
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:54,769
Fact is it just...
your feet take a beating when you're on them 13, 14 hours a day

623
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:59,941
wading through rapids and rivers
and boulders and whatnot.

624
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:01,651
So they're my favourite bird.

625
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,196
Although what I don't like about them is when I'm paddling by the shore

626
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,950
and they have a nest nearby,
it turns into the Alfred Hitchcock movie <i>The Birds</i>

627
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,326
and they swarm at me.

628
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,454
And if you look carefully,
you'll see that they have very sharp beaks.

629
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:17,584
It's July 22nd, I'm waiting for
the sound of the Bush plane.

630
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,168
So I'm looking forward

631
00:56:19,252 --> 00:56:24,591
to some new food rations
and fresh batteries.

632
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:27,510
And I'm just waiting here so.

633
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,219
It's him.

634
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,935
He's gonna touchdown.

635
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,520
Nice.

636
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:41,649
Food is on the way.

637
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:34,160
It's raining for the fourth
straight day

638
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,788
and it's about 11
o'clock at night,

639
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:38,039
I'm inside my tent.

640
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:43,920
And I'm still nice and dry and
warm and snug in here.

641
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:48,341
And it's gonna take more than
rain and bugs

642
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:51,010
to deter me.

643
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:30,133
That's what I'm dealing with here,
the white-water of the Coppermine River.

644
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:34,303
There's no way to drag up through that or pull,
so I had to portage around it.

645
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:26,731
And here is my wader and it's just those two little punctures there

646
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:28,775
that are causing me
all my grief.

647
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:32,737
So I'm gonna take some of this from the tree with my Swiss Army knife.

648
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:38,326
And then when that has melted
I'll lather it on to the wader.

649
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:43,331
And you can see I've applied some of
the spruce resin to the hole in the wader

650
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:46,834
with the stick here and,
hopefully, this does the job.

651
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:53,049
It's July 31st and the bugs are
just atrocious this morning.

652
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:56,219
They were bad last night but I mean
there's just massive clouds of them here.

653
00:59:57,095 --> 01:00:01,557
The fantastic news is that my
patch on my waders

654
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:05,895
using the resin from the spruce
tree has held up like a dream.

655
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:09,899
So, in the end, it was nature's
solution that did the job

656
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:12,485
that modern materials couldn't.

657
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:14,987
Duct tape, Gorilla Tape didn't
work on its own,

658
01:00:15,071 --> 01:00:18,866
but when I heated that resin up and put it on,
it worked like a charm.

659
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:20,409
And now I've got dry feet.

660
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:03,161
Oh my goodness,
there's a jackpot over here.

661
01:01:03,244 --> 01:01:05,872
In Newfoundland they call these
bake apples.

662
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:09,542
Mm...

663
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:13,045
This is so good.

664
01:01:13,129 --> 01:01:18,551
I still can't entirely dispel a
bit of anxiety that I feel.

665
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:22,138
It's still an open question whether or not I'll even make it to Baker Lake.

666
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:25,224
<i>It's just such a
long way and winter is coming.</i>

667
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:28,060
<i>I mean winter could come in
August, I don't know.</i>

668
01:01:29,312 --> 01:01:30,521
<i>It's impossible to say.</i>

669
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:35,776
<i>So I am just super conscious at all times that time is running out.</i>

670
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:55,004
Not too far away to the
southwest is a tree line

671
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:59,383
and that marks the start of vast forest that cloak northern Canada.

672
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:01,344
And somewhere down there
to the southwest

673
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:04,764
there must be some pretty bad forest fires raging right now.

674
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:08,726
Still little
hazy from those forest fires.

675
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:14,690
<i>I only really have at this point five weeks of decent weather left</i>

676
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:19,654
<i>and it's gonna probably take more than that for me to get to Baker Lake.</i>

677
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:24,408
Right now the
task for the moment is to kill

678
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:28,996
all these friggin' black flies inside the tent
with me because there is a lot of them.

679
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:31,874
I repeat, that is not a rock.

680
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:56,941
Those cries are coming from some
waterfowl out there on the lake.

681
01:02:57,024 --> 01:03:02,697
They make the strangest cries like a child in
distress just as I am about to call it a night.

682
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,079
Listen to the birds crying.

683
01:03:10,997 --> 01:03:13,749
And look at that it's something
like <i>The Land Before Time,</i>

684
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,876
dinosaurs
roamed the Earth over there.

685
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,964
I have to get my canoe across
all of that

686
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:24,302
and all of my gear
for about a kilometer.

687
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:39,108
Well, I just completed the
fourth portage of the day.

688
01:03:40,693 --> 01:03:42,570
I got the
canoe across all in one shot,

689
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:43,904
carried it over my head

690
01:03:44,697 --> 01:03:47,116
because I didn't want to risk
any more abuse to it

691
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,577
than necessary dragging it over
these rocks.

692
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:58,044
Well, in a land of desolate rock as far as the eye could see,

693
01:03:58,711 --> 01:04:01,213
old as time, this is the oldest
rock on the planet,

694
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:03,007
goes back billions of years,

695
01:04:04,091 --> 01:04:07,553
it's rather ironic
and good for me

696
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:11,015
that I have this beautiful
little bed here for the night.

697
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:14,935
I'm gonna call this home for
tonight and sleep

698
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:20,900
in this nice little patch of lichens and Labrador tea and crowberries.

699
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:23,944
For the first time in like
almost three months

700
01:04:24,612 --> 01:04:28,199
I can see the moon,
and it's a full moon

701
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:31,494
and there's always something to me anyways special about a full moon.

702
01:04:31,577 --> 01:04:33,913
But it's starting to get dark.

703
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:40,628
And the night is dark and
full of terror, as they say.

704
01:05:24,922 --> 01:05:28,968
You paddle for over 11 hours and almost all of it against the wind

705
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:32,054
and you really just want to make dinner and crawl inside your tent,

706
01:05:32,847 --> 01:05:35,975
but you can't because
there's water down your stove.

707
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:42,982
First animal that pops into mind almost immediately is polar bear.

708
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,783
I don't know what it's all from,
it's just the wear and tear

709
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:56,871
and the abuse that your body goes through on an expedition like this.

710
01:05:57,496 --> 01:06:03,210
Thunder clouds rolling in across the tundra.
And that's always a little ominous.

711
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:14,138
Look at this nice beach
all to myself. How lovely?

712
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:32,072
This is where a grizzly bear has
dug up the burrows

713
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:36,285
of some Arctic ground squirrels because the
grizzlies love to eat the ground squirrels.

714
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:38,454
So that's what this is here.

715
01:06:38,537 --> 01:06:41,790
Red sky at night,
sailor's delight.

716
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:45,211
Red sky in morning,
sailors take warning.

717
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:48,380
I'm gonna go now and paddle
as hard as I can

718
01:06:48,464 --> 01:06:51,509
for as long as I can for as
long as the lake stays calm.

719
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:14,508
But it's another rainy morning
and I have to get up

720
01:08:14,592 --> 01:08:18,137
and hike all the way back to the
start of the canyon,

721
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,139
grab my canoe
which I left there,

722
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:23,809
portage it across the canyon or
at least up to this point,

723
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,452
which is kind of like the
halfway point,

724
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:29,690
and continue the portage
in four loads,

725
01:08:30,566 --> 01:08:33,027
taking all of my stuff all the
way across the canyon.

726
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:35,362
I have to do it.

727
01:08:40,743 --> 01:08:43,912
Well, good thing I got waders on 'cause that's pretty deep.

728
01:08:51,462 --> 01:08:53,088
Hasn't been break for a while,

729
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:57,635
it's just this dismal Grey skies
hanging over the land.

730
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:01,221
So it's made it hard
to really dry stuff out.

731
01:09:01,305 --> 01:09:04,350
I got some wet clothes that
I can't dry for lack of sun

732
01:09:04,433 --> 01:09:07,978
and I'm running kind of low on
my battery life too

733
01:09:08,062 --> 01:09:12,650
because I haven't been able to recharge anything with my solar panel

734
01:09:12,733 --> 01:09:15,569
because there hasn't
been enough sun.

735
01:09:17,446 --> 01:09:20,532
But I'm gonna get cozy as I
can inside the tent

736
01:09:20,616 --> 01:09:23,744
because the nights are getting cold now that it's later in the season.

737
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,120
And...

738
01:09:27,748 --> 01:09:29,583
The nights
are also getting darker.

739
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:34,004
It's getting dark early
and it's staying dark longer

740
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:36,173
now that we're getting late in
the season.

741
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:41,220
And I'm not really sure at this point how much longer it's gonna take me

742
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:42,513
to get to Baker Lake.

743
01:09:43,138 --> 01:09:45,766
But that's when I am
pushing myself 12 hours a day

744
01:09:46,475 --> 01:09:49,812
to get to Baker Lake,
the little Inuit community.

745
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:54,274
Right now my biggest
concern is the wind.

746
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:56,151
Wind has been fierce all day,

747
01:09:56,276 --> 01:10:00,364
just really powerful wind gusts
that make canoeing downriver

748
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,366
seem like
I'm still going upriver.

749
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:05,160
At times the current has been...
Or the wind has been so strong

750
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:10,457
that it actually has pushed me back upriver despite the strong current.

751
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:15,504
Basically, I've tried to shift everything out of the back end of the canoe,

752
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:17,256
the stern up to the front.

753
01:10:17,339 --> 01:10:21,135
So I've loaded up the front as much as I can,
the bow of the canoe,

754
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:25,139
with anything I've got, you know, GoPros,
water bottles, my backpack,

755
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:28,851
and I've shifted the barrels up
to the front as well

756
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:31,854
to concentrate the weight up

757
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:35,941
at the bow of the canoe that's going downriver into that headwind,

758
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:37,192
that really strong wind.

759
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:42,614
Doing it this way is allowing me to make
progress even against that strong wind.

760
01:10:42,698 --> 01:10:46,201
Otherwise, the canoe lightly
loaded in the bow,

761
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:49,913
wind is just spinning my canoe
and I'm, literally,

762
01:10:49,997 --> 01:10:53,500
just spinning 360 degrees
and not get anywhere.

763
01:10:53,584 --> 01:10:58,213
So shifting the weight up to the
front is making the canoe go

764
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:00,257
downriver even into the wind.

765
01:11:08,015 --> 01:11:10,975
I pulled ashore here because I could
see that there was some serious trouble

766
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:12,311
waiting for me up ahead.

767
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:14,104
We've got a rapid there.

768
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:15,689
That's not the real problem.

769
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:17,691
It's what's beyond the rapid.

770
01:11:18,317 --> 01:11:20,819
That's a vertical drop
and I can see the mist rising,

771
01:11:20,903 --> 01:11:24,364
there's a big waterfall there
and another canyon.

772
01:11:29,787 --> 01:11:31,580
That goes in the
right canyon there.

773
01:11:43,592 --> 01:11:46,428
<i>I know that I'm not, obviously,
not the first person to canoe this river</i>

774
01:11:46,512 --> 01:11:48,889
<i>because I'm following
some historic reports.</i>

775
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:54,478
But, obviously, someone at some
point came before me

776
01:11:54,561 --> 01:11:58,273
and wasn't fully prepared for
just how gruelling and long

777
01:11:58,398 --> 01:12:03,695
the portages around these huge canyons
actually are because look at this,

778
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:07,866
someone has abandoned all this
stuff right here.

779
01:12:09,284 --> 01:12:13,205
There's a barrel,
a bag of garbage,

780
01:12:13,288 --> 01:12:16,291
three backpacks,
some other bags,

781
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:19,962
some empty Coleman camp fuel.

782
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:23,465
And these bags have been here
for quite a while.

783
01:12:23,549 --> 01:12:28,262
You can see the water is accumulated on top
and they're drenched and they're pretty old,

784
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:31,765
ripped up and sand's
accumulated around them.

785
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:34,309
You know I
believe, fundamentally,

786
01:12:34,393 --> 01:12:36,520
that coming to this wilderness
is a privilege.

787
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:40,482
And no matter how difficult and
back-breaking it may be,

788
01:12:40,566 --> 01:12:44,278
you have a responsibility to
pack in anything you...

789
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:46,738
Or pack out anything you bring
in with you, right.

790
01:12:46,822 --> 01:12:50,826
You can't just throw stuff away.
The litter out here is real travesty.

791
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:54,288
It's a very famous grove on the
Thelon River

792
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:56,832
and it's in that spruce forest

793
01:12:57,499 --> 01:13:00,294
that in 1927 John Hornby
and his two companions

794
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:02,462
starved to death in their cabin.

795
01:13:02,546 --> 01:13:06,008
<i>They were depending on the caribou migration,
they never found it.</i>

796
01:13:08,093 --> 01:13:10,345
The geese have started
to fly south.

797
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,181
Winter is coming.

798
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:25,944
That's a wolf, you hear him?

799
01:13:26,653 --> 01:13:30,991
Her. She's calling her baby cub.

800
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:35,329
Check on the little ones because they saw
this suspicious creature going downriver.

801
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:40,500
Wow, that's amazing.

802
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:43,210
Did you hear that?

803
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:48,800
So it's a whole
family of wolves there.

804
01:13:48,884 --> 01:13:54,848
The mom with four little pups
and the two adults there.

805
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:58,435
It's just incredible.

806
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:03,231
So I'm coming up to four months since I actually last saw my fiancée

807
01:14:03,315 --> 01:14:05,192
and since I was last home.

808
01:14:06,193 --> 01:14:08,654
And I don't know how long,
you know, take me

809
01:14:08,737 --> 01:14:11,657
to complete the end of this
journey and get to Baker Lake

810
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:16,119
because the weather is beyond my
control and wind is such a critical factor.

811
01:14:16,203 --> 01:14:20,958
Today with the wind in my favour,
I traveled probably a hundred kilometers.

812
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:25,253
But if it goes against me,
I'm lucky if I can get 10 done in a day.

813
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:31,009
The moose is
really enjoying the beach.

814
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:35,764
Came up here on his summer vacation from the forest down south.

815
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:38,809
Heard that they had some nice
beaches up here on the river.

816
01:15:33,989 --> 01:15:36,074
And my matches
just fell in the water.

817
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,169
Looks like bad news.

818
01:15:48,837 --> 01:15:52,507
If I'm very lucky,
the wind might blow them right past me.

819
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:56,219
But my canoe is still down there and I gotta go get it and bring it up here.

820
01:15:57,888 --> 01:15:59,014
I've made camp here.

821
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:22,537
And this canoe has just been an
absolute warrior.

822
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:24,581
I'm amazed that how tough it is.

823
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:27,751
You can see it's suffered
quite a lot of damage

824
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:31,046
from the ice and the
rocks and everything else,

825
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:35,675
but there's no leaks in it whatsoever and it's holding on its own.

826
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:41,056
So, very sturdy canoe
and I am very lucky

827
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:43,683
and fortunate
to have it with me.

828
01:16:57,906 --> 01:17:01,409
Kind of puts one in a meditative
and reflective mood, I suppose,

829
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:06,665
when you're out here alone in the wilderness
and you're just wandering across the land

830
01:17:06,748 --> 01:17:11,253
and you come across a human skull just lying there in the open.

831
01:17:12,087 --> 01:17:16,550
Out of respect,
I'm not gonna film it and show the bones on camera,

832
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:18,009
so I didn't film it.

833
01:17:18,093 --> 01:17:21,847
And I guess if I were superstitious and afraid of ghosts,

834
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:25,183
I might be a little apprehensive
but, fortunately, I'm not,

835
01:17:25,267 --> 01:17:29,312
and I find it more interesting
than anything.

836
01:17:31,356 --> 01:17:33,984
So it's early morning and I've just got my canoe loaded behind me.

837
01:17:34,067 --> 01:17:36,611
The wind is still pretty strong
but I'm gonna paddle hard

838
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:39,197
and I'm in the final phase of
the journey at this point.

839
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:42,325
The end is almost in sight,
so I gotta get going here.

840
01:18:07,601 --> 01:18:09,978
Since day one of the expedition,

841
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:15,275
stashed away in my barrel I've
been saving this tea...

842
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:17,527
Tea teabags, cinnamon apple.

843
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:23,283
And I had it before I left on the expedition when I was back home

844
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:26,494
and I thought it was really delicious and I had a second one of these.

845
01:18:26,578 --> 01:18:30,665
So I decided to take it with me on the expedition and I only had this one.

846
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:33,293
All my other herbal
tea was mauled apple.

847
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:36,838
But this cinnamon apple one is
like of a much better quality.

848
01:18:36,922 --> 01:18:39,507
And I've
saved it this whole expedition.

849
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,302
Let's get that off of there.

850
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:47,641
So down behind me there that's my last campsite of the expedition,

851
01:18:47,724 --> 01:18:48,850
fingers crossed.

852
01:18:48,934 --> 01:18:51,561
If everything goes according to
plan, the weather holds out,

853
01:18:51,645 --> 01:18:56,191
I should be good to paddle the
rest of the way to Baker Lake,

854
01:18:56,274 --> 01:19:02,280
the little community,
and that will end my journey alone across the Arctic.

855
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:05,867
So, yeah,

856
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:08,954
it's been over a
hundred days now solo.

857
01:19:09,037 --> 01:19:11,998
It's September 5th and
first thing tomorrow,

858
01:19:12,082 --> 01:19:14,709
September 6th,
I'm gonna paddle into town.

859
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:18,380
It's not quite over yet,
anything could still happen.

860
01:19:18,922 --> 01:19:20,966
The dawn could bring
some crazy weather,

861
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:23,593
a bear could come
and maul me in the night,

862
01:19:23,677 --> 01:19:27,722
muskoxen can plow inside my tent,
go get struck by lightning.

863
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:30,517
<i>So, you know, I don't want to
celebrate just yet.</i>

864
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:33,228
<i>But tomorrow
when I reach Baker Lake,</i>

865
01:19:33,853 --> 01:19:37,190
<i>then the journey will be over.</i>

866
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:49,744
This is the morning
of September 6,

867
01:19:49,828 --> 01:19:53,540
and I'm just packing up my canoe
for the final time.

868
01:19:53,623 --> 01:19:57,377
I'm about to set off on the final leg of my journey to reach Baker Lake.

869
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:01,006
So this is day 102 since I left
the Arctic Circle

870
01:20:01,089 --> 01:20:02,966
and nearly
four months since I left home.

871
01:20:06,678 --> 01:20:08,263
<i>You only live once,</i>

872
01:20:08,346 --> 01:20:09,681
<i>you're only young once</i>

873
01:20:09,764 --> 01:20:11,766
<i>and I've always been very
conscious of that fact</i>

874
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:14,185
<i>when it comes to
planning my expeditions.</i>

875
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:16,313
<i>I really want
to push myself hard now</i>

876
01:20:16,396 --> 01:20:20,066
<i>because I feel like I'm in my prime and I have to do these expeditions</i>

877
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:23,194
<i>and I want to continue doing them for as long as I am able to.</i>

878
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:34,247
<i>One day if I am able to look
back when I am old</i>

879
01:20:34,331 --> 01:20:37,083
<i>on all the adventures and
journeys that I've done,</i>

880
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:41,463
<i>hopefully, I'll have some satisfaction that I saw the wilderness</i>

881
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:43,381
<i>while it still exists.</i>

882
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:53,600
<i>There's a tinge of regret and sadness that it's coming to an end</i>

883
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:56,978
<i>because I really loved the expedition and I really loved the journey,</i>

884
01:20:57,771 --> 01:21:00,523
<i>and there's a part of me that
wishes I could keep going.</i>

885
01:22:49,799 --> 01:22:51,843
Yeah, that's as
good as I was expecting.

886
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:06,941
Well, you're supposed
to drop off a canoe.

887
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:09,027
Apparently,
they emailed you about it.

888
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,403
And her name is Sheryl.

889
01:23:10,487 --> 01:23:11,738
Does that sound about right?

890
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,281
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

891
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:16,010
So it's time to say goodbye to
my friend, my companion

892
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:18,411
in the last three
and a half months.

893
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:21,748
We're supposed to be reunited
in Winnipeg.

894
01:23:21,831 --> 01:23:23,958
And it feels kind of
sad to leave it here,

895
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:27,921
but it's amazing canoe and it withstood this journey the whole way.

896
01:23:28,004 --> 01:23:29,506
So, it's pretty awesome.

897
01:23:55,156 --> 01:23:56,699
How many barrels did you bring?

898
01:23:58,326 --> 01:24:02,413
Well, there is, what, five.

899
01:24:02,497 --> 01:24:05,726
There's actually five here 'cause the yellow one is inside this one.
I think it's...

900
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:06,751
Welcome home.

901
01:24:10,672 --> 01:24:12,840
Yeah, I'm not... I'm not
wearing the big one.

902
01:24:12,924 --> 01:24:16,427
I'll wear this one.
I think that one should come off though, it might fall.

903
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:17,679
I'll hang on to this.

904
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:18,762
I can handle this.

905
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:47,292
Well, Adam Shoalts is a writer,
explorer, and public speaker

906
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:49,961
who has hiked to all corners
of this country.

907
01:24:50,044 --> 01:24:53,464
His new book is entitled
<i>History of Canada in Ten Maps.</i>

908
01:24:53,548 --> 01:24:57,468
It tells the story of Canada from the Vikings to the early 19th century,

909
01:24:57,552 --> 01:24:59,137
and Adam joins me now.

910
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:01,139
And I guess first
off Adam, welcome back.

911
01:25:01,222 --> 01:25:02,599
You just recently returned.

912
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:05,059
Oh, yeah, I was in the Arctic
for the last four months

913
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:08,813
doing a journey across as my own
Canada 150 project.

914
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:11,441
But it's great to be back
and here in the studio.
