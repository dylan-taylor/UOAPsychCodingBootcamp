1
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,567
<i>So stay with us,
because later this afternoon,</i>

2
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:30,030
<i>we're lucky enough to be talking to
Anna Scott, Hollywood's biggest star by far.</i>

3
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,408
<i>Miss Scott's latest ﬁlm
is once again topping the charts…</i>

4
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,692
<i>Of course, I've seen her films
and always thought she was, well, fabulous.</i>

5
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:34,196
<i>But, you know, a million, million miles
from the world I live in.</i>

6
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,657
<i>Which is here, Notting Hill.</i>

7
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,867
<i>My favourite bit of London.</i>

8
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,410
<i>There's the market on weekdays</i>

9
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,205
<i>selling every fruit and vegetable
known to man.</i>

10
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,166
Rock hard bananas, five for a pound!

11
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,293
<i>The tattoo parlour with a guy outside</i>

12
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,922
<i>who got drunk and now can't remember
why he chose "I love Ken."</i>

13
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,967
<i>The radical hairdressers,
where everyone comes out looking like</i>

14
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>the Cookie Monster,
whether they want to or not.</i>

15
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,223
<i>And then, suddenly, it's the weekend</i>

16
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,184
<i>and from break of day hundreds of stalls
appear out of nowhere</i>

17
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,187
<i>filling Portobello Road,
right up to Notting Hill Gate.</i>

18
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,982
<i>And wherever you look thousands of people
are buying millions of antiques,</i>

19
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,986
<i>some genuine,
and some not quite so genuine.</i>

20
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,700
<i>And what's great is that lots of friends
have ended up in this part of London.</i>

21
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,245
<i>That's Tony, for example,
architect turned chef</i>

22
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,707
<i>who recently invested all the money
he ever earned in a new restaurant.</i>

23
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,210
<i>And so,
this is where I spend my days and years,</i>

24
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,212
<i>in this small village in the middle of the city,</i>

25
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,382
<i>in a house with a blue door
that my wife and I bought together</i>

26
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:39,261
<i>before she left me for a man
who looked exactly like Harrison Ford.</i>

27
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:43,056
<i>And where I now lead a strange
half-life with a Iodger called…</i>

28
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,141
Spike?

29
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,230
Hi.

30
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,442
You couldn't help me with an
incredibly important decision, could you?

31
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,485
Is this important in comparison to, let's say,

32
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,237
whether they should cancel
Third World debt?

33
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,782
That's right. I'm at last going out
on a date with the great Janine

34
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,909
and I just wanna be sure
I've picked the right T-shirt.

35
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,495
- What are the choices?
- Well, wait for it.

36
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,298
First there's this one. Cool, huh?

37
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,802
Yeah, it might make it hard
to strike a really romantic note.

38
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,096
Point taken. Don't despair.

39
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,808
If it's romance we're looking for
I believe I have just the thing.

40
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,275
Yeah, well, there again, she might not think
you had true love on your mind.

41
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,736
Right. Just one more.

42
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,827
True love here I come.

43
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,462
Well, yeah. Yeah, that's, that's perfect.

44
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,091
Great. Thanks. Wish me luck.

45
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,135
Good luck.

46
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,893
<i>And so it was just
another hopeless Wednesday</i>

47
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,271
<i>as I walked the thousand yards
through the market to work,</i>

48
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:17,526
<i>never suspecting that this was the day
that was gonna change my life forever.</i>

49
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,904
<i>This is work, by the way,
my little travel bookshop.</i>

50
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,699
<i>-Morning, Martin.
- Morning, Monseigneur.</i>

51
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,370
<i>Which, well, sells travel books</i>

52
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,748
<i>and to be frank with you,
doesn't always sell many of those.</i>

53
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:36,711
Classic.

54
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:42,175
Profit from major sales push, minus £347.

55
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,430
Shall I go and get you a cappuccino?

56
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,559
- You know, ease the pain a bit.
- Yeah. Yeah.

57
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,186
Better make it a half. All I can afford.

58
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,940
Get your logic. Demi-cappu coming right up.

59
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,343
Can I help you at all?

60
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,055
No, thanks, I'll just look around.

61
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,183
Fine.

62
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,152
That book's really not great.

63
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,489
Just in case browsing turned to buying,
you'd be wasting your money.

64
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:52,245
But if it's Turkey you're interested in,
this one, on the other hand, is very good.

65
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,584
I think the man who wrote it
has actually been to Turkey, which helps.

66
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,670
There's also a very amusing incident
with a kebab

67
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,590
which is one of many amusing incidents.

68
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,342
Thanks, I'll think about it.

69
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,178
Or, in the bigger hard-back variety, there's...

70
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,514
I'm sorry, can you just give me a second?

71
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,686
Excuse me.

72
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,522
- Yes?
- Bad news.

73
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,608
What?

74
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,653
We've got a security camera
in this bit of the shop.

75
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,237
So?

76
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,949
So I saw you
put that book down your trousers.

77
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,828
- What book?
- The one down your trousers.

78
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,374
I don't have a book down my trousers.

79
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,587
Right, I tell you what, I'll call the police

80
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:46,091
and what can I say, if I'm wrong about
the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario,

81
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,634
I really apologise.

82
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:52,097
Okay. What if
I did have a book down my trousers?

83
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,225
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk

84
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,062
<i>you'd remove the Cadogan Guide to Bali
from your trousers</i>

85
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,941
and either wipe it and put it back or buy it.

86
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,735
I'll see you in a sec.

87
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,446
I'm sorry about that.

88
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,615
No, it's fine.

89
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,703
I was gonna steal one
but now I've changed my mind.

90
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,872
Signed by the author, I see.

91
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,334
Yeah, couldn't stop him.

92
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,963
If you can find an unsigned one,
it's worth an absolute fortune.

93
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,799
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

94
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,592
Can I have your autograph?

95
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,429
- Sure.
- Here.

96
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,974
- What's your name?
- Rufus.

97
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,524
What does it say?

98
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:49,195
That's my signature, and above it,
it says "Dear Rufus, you belong in jail."

99
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,780
Good one.

100
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,576
Do you want my phone number?

101
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,246
Tempting, but no.

102
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,248
Thank you.

103
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,503
I will take this one.

104
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,338
Oh, right, right.

105
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:12,093
So, well, on second thoughts
maybe it's not that bad after all.

106
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,472
Actually it's a sort of classic, really.

107
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,809
None of those childish kebab stories
you find in so many books these days.

108
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,563
I tell you what,
I'll throw in one of those for free.

109
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:28,526
Useful for lighting fires, wrapping fish,
that sort of thing.

110
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,491
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.

111
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,733
Here we are. Cappuccino, as ordered.

112
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,444
Thanks.

113
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,448
I don't think
you'll believe who was just in here.

114
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,867
Who? Was it someone famous?

115
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,704
No, no, no.

116
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,875
Would be exciting though, wouldn't it,
if someone famous came into the shop?

117
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:32,173
Do you know, this is pretty amazing
actually, but I once saw Ringo Starr.

118
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,426
- Where was that?
- Kensington High Street.

119
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,511
At least I think it was Ringo.

120
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,056
<i>It might have been that man
from Fiddler On The Roof.</i>

121
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,392
- You know, Toppy.
- Topol.

122
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,478
Yes, that's right. Topol.

123
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,568
Actually, Ringo Starr
doesn't look at all like Topol.

124
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,362
Yeah, but he was
quite a long way away from me.

125
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,615
So actually
it could've been neither of them?

126
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,160
Yes, I suppose so, yes.

127
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,455
- It's not a classic anecdote, is it?
- Not a classic, no. No.

128
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,837
Another one?

129
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:16,176
Yes. No! Let's go crazy.
I'll have an orange juice.

130
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,143
- Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.
- See you later.

131
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,278
- Shit! Bugger!
- Oh, my God!

132
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,280
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

133
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,033
- Here let me...
- Get your hands off!

134
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,203
I'm really sorry. I live just over the street.

135
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,372
I have water and soap.
You can get cleaned up.

136
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,209
No, thank you.
I just need to get my car back.

137
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,543
I also have a phone.

138
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,170
I'm confident that in five minutes

139
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,839
we can have you spick and span
and back on the street again.

140
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,258
In the non-prostitute sense, obviously.

141
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,472
All right.

142
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:07,060
Well, what do you mean
"just over the street"? Give it to me in yards.

143
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,855
Eighteen yards. That's my house there
with the blue front door.

144
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,820
Come on in. I'll just, I'll just...

145
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,369
Right. Right.

146
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,499
Come in.
It's not quite as tidy as it normally is, I fear.

147
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:35,004
But the bathroom's on the top floor.
And the telephone's just up here.

148
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,467
Here, let me...

149
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,894
Round the corner,
straight on, straight on up.

150
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,691
Bugger!

151
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,883
- Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
- No.

152
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,553
- Coffee?
- No.

153
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,014
Orange juice?

154
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,558
Probably not.

155
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,102
Something else cold?

156
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,232
Coke? Water?

157
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,444
Some disgusting sugary drink

158
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,654
pretending to have
something to do with fruits of the forest?

159
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,739
No.

160
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,199
Would you like something to eat?

161
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:50,038
Something to nibble?
Apricots soaked in honey?

162
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,332
Quite why, no one knows,

163
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:56,794
because it stops them tasting of apricots
and makes them taste like honey,

164
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:01,549
and if you wanted honey
you'd just buy honey instead of apricots.

165
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,846
But nevertheless, there we go,
they're yours if you want them.

166
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,264
No.

167
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,478
Do you always say "no" to everything?

168
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,231
No.

169
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:24,364
I'd better be going. Thanks for your... help.

170
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,824
You're welcome.

171
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:31,579
And may I also say... heavenly.

172
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,625
I'll just take my one chance to say it.

173
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,709
After you've read that terrible book

174
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,796
you're certainly
not gonna be coming back to the shop.

175
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,714
Thank you.

176
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,968
Yeah, well, my pleasure.

177
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,776
So... it was nice to meet you.

178
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,863
Surreal but nice.

179
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,826
Sorry.

180
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,920
"Surreal but nice." What was I thinking?

181
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,101
- Hi.
- Hi.

182
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,313
- I forgot my other bag.
- Oh, right. Right.

183
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,450
Thanks.

184
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,651
I'm very sorry
about the "surreal but nice" comment.

185
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,529
- Disaster.
- That's okay.

186
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:32,825
I thought the apricot and honey thing
was the real low point.

187
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:40,625
Oh, my God. My flatmate.
I'm sorry. There's no excuse for him.

188
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,421
- Hi.
- Hi.

189
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,798
I'm just going into the kitchen
to get some food.

190
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:52,595
Then I'm gonna tell you a story that will
make your balls shrink to the size of raisins.

191
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,269
Probably best not to tell anyone about this.

192
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,606
Right. Right, no one.

193
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,069
I'll tell myself sometimes but, don't worry,
I won't believe it.

194
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,953
- Bye.
- Bye.

195
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,134
There's something wrong with this yoghurt.

196
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,432
- It's not yoghurt. It's mayonnaise.
- Oh, right. There we are then.

197
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,938
On for a videofest tonight?

198
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,109
I got some absolute classics.

199
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,698
<i>-Smile.
- No.</i>

200
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,455
<i>-Smile.
- I've got nothing to smile about.</i>

201
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:17,430
<i>Okay, in about seven seconds
I'm going to ask you to marry me.</i>

202
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:31,110
Imagine... somewhere in the world
there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.

203
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:40,119
She is... fairly fabulous.

204
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,465
- Do you have any books by Dickens?
- No.

205
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:57,053
No, I'm afraid we're a travel bookshop.
We only sell travel books.

206
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,766
Oh, right.
How about the new John Grisham thriller?

207
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,771
Well, no, because that's a novel too, isn't it?

208
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,231
Oh, right.

209
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,905
<i>Have you got Winnie-the-Pooh?</i>

210
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,994
- Martin, your customer.
- Can I help you?

211
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,093
- Hey.
- Hi.

212
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:47,061
Just, incidentally,
why are you wearing that?

213
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,689
Combination of factors really.

214
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,524
No clean clothes...

215
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,444
There never will be, you know,
unless you actually clean your clothes.

216
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,947
- Vicious circle.
- Yeah.

217
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,827
And I was, like, rooting round in your things
and I found this and I thought, "Cool."

218
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,163
Kinda spacey.

219
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,795
There's something wrong
with the goggles, though.

220
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,256
No, they were prescription.

221
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,009
- Groovy.
- So I could see all the fishes properly.

222
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,637
You should do more of this stuff.

223
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,266
- So, look, any messages today?
- Yeah, I wrote a couple down.

224
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,395
So there were two,
there were two messages? Right?

225
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,817
You want me
to write down all your messages?

226
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:39,488
Okay. Who are the ones
that you didn't write down from?

227
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,117
No, gone completely.

228
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,410
Oh, no, there was one from your mum.

229
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,413
She said don't forget lunch,
and her leg's hurting again.

230
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,790
- No one else?
- Absolutely no one else.

231
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,672
Though if we're going for this obsessive
writing-down-all-the-message thing,

232
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,675
some American girl called Anna
called a few days ago.

233
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,974
What did she say?

234
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,559
Well, it was genuinely bizarre.

235
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:13,856
She said, "Hi, it's Anna."
Then she said, "Call me at The Ritz."

236
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,110
And then gave herself
a completely different name.

237
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,363
- Which was?
- Absolutely no idea.

238
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,283
Remembering one name's hard enough.

239
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,954
No, I know that. She said that.
I know she's using another name.

240
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,291
The problem is
she left the message with my flatmate

241
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,460
which was a very serious mistake.

242
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,839
Imagine, if you will,
the stupidest person you've ever met.

243
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,633
Are you doing that?

244
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,760
Yes, sir, I have him in my mind.

245
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,969
And now double it.

246
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:49,016
And that is the, what can I say,
the git that I am living with.

247
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,478
- And he can't remember this other...
- Try Flintstone.

248
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,524
- Sorry. What?
- I think she said her name was Flintstone.

249
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,989
I don't suppose Flintstone rings any bells,
does it?

250
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,742
- I'll put you right through, sir.
- Oh, my God.

251
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,790
Hello. Hi.

252
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,085
Hi.

253
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:20,297
Hi. Sorry. It's William Thacker.

254
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,134
<i>- Yes?
- We... I work in a bookshop.</i>

255
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:28,097
<i>You played it pretty cool there,
waiting for three days to call.</i>

256
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,433
Oh, no, I promise you I've never played
anything cool in my entire life.

257
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:35,271
My flatmate, who I'll stab to death later,
never gave me the message.

258
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,399
I don't know. Perhaps

259
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,486
I could drop round for tea later
or something?

260
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,990
<i>Things are pretty busy here.
I might be free around 4:00.</i>

261
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,325
Right. Right. Great.

262
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,245
<i>-Bye.
- Bye.</i>

263
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,460
Classic.

264
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,301
Classic.

265
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,091
- Which floor?
- Three, please.

266
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,917
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

267
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:36,058
Hi. Hi. I'm Karen. I'm sorry,
things are running a little bit late.

268
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,727
Here's the thing.
Do you wanna come this way?

269
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,231
Through here.

270
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,948
- So what did you think of the film?
- Yeah, I thought it was fantastic.

271
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:55,035
<i>I thought it was Close Encounters
meets Jean de Florette.</i>

272
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,331
I agree.

273
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,127
I'm sorry, I didn't get down
what magazines you're from.

274
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,421
<i>-Time Out.
- Great.</i>

275
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,256
And you're from?

276
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,639
<i>Horse & Hound.</i>

277
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,939
The name's William Thacker.
Actually, she might be expecting me.

278
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,525
Oh, okay. Take a seat and I'll go check.

279
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:34,033
I see you've...
I see you've brought her some flowers.

280
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:39,204
No. These are for my grandmother.

281
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,958
She's in a hospital down the road.

282
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,544
Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone,
you know.

283
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,546
Sure, right. Absolutely, yeah.

284
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,383
Which hospital's that?

285
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,305
Do you mind me not saying?
It's a rather distressing thing, isn't it?

286
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,723
Name of the hospital kind of gives it away.

287
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,558
- Absolutely. Sure.
- Cheers.

288
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:05,564
- Right. Mr. Thacker, if you come this way.
- Right.

289
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,318
You've got five minutes.

290
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,496
- Hi.
- Hello.

291
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,334
I brought these, but clearly...

292
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,837
No, they're great. They're great.

293
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,091
I'm sorry about not ringing back.

294
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,426
The whole "two names" concept

295
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,096
was totally too much for my flatmate's
pea-sized intellect.

296
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,933
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.
I always pick a cartoon character.

297
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,352
Last time I was Mrs. Bambi.

298
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,316
- Everything all right?
- Yes, thank you.

299
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,443
<i>And you're from Horse & Hound?</i>

300
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,154
Good.

301
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,490
Is that so? Well.

302
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,207
So,

303
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,674
I'll just fire away, then, shall I?

304
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,010
Right.

305
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,599
The film's great,

306
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:26,353
and I just was wondering whether

307
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:33,819
you ever thought of having
more... horses in it?

308
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,284
Well, we would have liked to,

309
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:45,414
but it was difficult, obviously,
being set in space.

310
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:50,085
Space, right, yeah.
Yeah, obviously very difficult.

311
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,714
I'm so sorry.

312
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,757
I arrived outside,
they thrust this thing into my hand.

313
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,719
No, it's my fault.
I thought this would all be over by now.

314
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,306
I just wanted to sort of apologise
for the kissing thing.

315
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,433
I seriously don't know what came over me.

316
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,603
I just wanted to make sure
that you were fine about it.

317
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:13,192
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely fine.

318
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,198
Do remember that Miss Scott is also
keen to talk about her next project

319
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,950
which she is shooting later in the summer.

320
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,871
Yes, excellent. Excellent.

321
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,629
Any horses in that one?

322
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:39,593
Or hounds for that matter? Our readers
are equally intrigued by both species.

323
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,680
It takes place on a submarine.

324
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,351
Well, bad luck.

325
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:53,523
But if there were horses in it

326
00:28:54,566 --> 00:29:00,781
would you be riding them or would you be
getting a stunt-horse-double-man-thing?

327
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,080
I'm a complete moron. I apologise.

328
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,082
This is very weird.

329
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,627
It's the sort of thing that happens in dreams,
not in real life.

330
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:20,842
I mean, good dreams.
It's a dream, in fact, to see you again.

331
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,389
What happens next in the dream?

332
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:34,022
I suppose that in the dream,
"dream scenario,"

333
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:37,693
I just change my personality

334
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,529
because you can do that in dreams

335
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:48,745
and walk over and kiss the girl. But...

336
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,217
Time's up, I'm afraid.
Did you get what you wanted?

337
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,014
- Nearly, nearly.
- Well, maybe just one last question.

338
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,560
- Sure.
- Right, right.

339
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,066
Are you busy tonight?

340
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,404
- Yes.
- Right. Right.

341
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,283
Come in.

342
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:30,412
- Well, it was nice to meet you.
- Yes, and you.

343
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,081
Surreal but nice.

344
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,667
Thank you.

345
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,171
<i>You are Horse & Hound's favourite actress.</i>

346
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,924
You and Black Beauty tied.

347
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,766
Hang on, don't go. How was she?

348
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,562
- Fabulous.
- Excellent.

349
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,732
Wait a minute,
she took your grandmother's flowers.

350
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:03,487
Yeah, yeah. That's right. Bitch.

351
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:08,742
Mr. Thacker. If you'd like to come with me
we can just rush you through the others.

352
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,871
<i>-The others?
- Mr. Thacker is from Horse & Hound.</i>

353
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,752
- How's it going?
- Very well. Thank you.

354
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,003
Have a seat.

355
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,508
Well, did you enjoy the film?

356
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,969
Yes. Enormously.

357
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,597
- Well, fire away.
- Right.

358
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,061
- Did you enjoy making the film?
- Yes, I did.

359
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,146
Good.

360
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,441
Any bit in particular?

361
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,236
You tell me what "bit" you enjoyed the most

362
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,072
and I'll tell you
if I enjoyed making that "bit."

363
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:55,038
I…liked the bit in space.

364
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,874
Very much.

365
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:02,421
Did you identify
with the character you're playing?

366
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,092
No.

367
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:09,845
No.

368
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,472
Oh.

369
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,392
Why not?

370
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,360
Because he's playing
a psychopathic flesh-eating robot.

371
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:26,987
Classic.

372
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,452
So, is this your first film?

373
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,912
No, it's my 22nd.

374
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,539
Of course it is.

375
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,876
Any favourites among the 22?

376
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,921
- Working with Leonardo.
- Da Vinci?

377
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,550
- DiCaprio.
- Of course.

378
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,055
And is he your favourite Italian director?

379
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,771
- Mr. Thacker?
- Oh, no.

380
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,733
- Have you got a minute?
- No.

381
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,741
Hi.

382
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:16,745
Hi.

383
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,749
Yeah, so the...

384
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,628
The thing I was doing tonight
I'm not doing any more.

385
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:30,759
I told them I had to spend the evening
with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.

386
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,598
Well, great. Fantastic. That's...

387
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:42,395
Shittity brickity.
It's my sister's birthday. Shit.

388
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,023
- We're meant to be having dinner.
- Okay, that's fine.

389
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,858
No, I'm sure I can get out of it.

390
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:50,445
No, I mean, if it's fine with you,
I'll be your date.

391
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:57,202
You'll be my date
to my little sister's birthday party?

392
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,623
- If it's all right.
- Well, yeah, I'm sure it's all right.

393
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,458
My friend Max is cooking

394
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:07,128
and he is generally acknowledged to be
the worst cook in the world,

395
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,383
but you could hide the food
in your handbag or something.

396
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,344
- Okay.
- Okay.

397
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,767
- He's bringing a girl?
- Miracles do happen.

398
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,938
- Does the girl have a name?
- Don't know, wouldn't say.

399
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,316
Oh Christ, what is going on in there?

400
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,486
Oh, God!

401
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,616
Hi, come on in. Vague food crisis.

402
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,416
Hiya.

403
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:48,503
Sorry, the guinea-fowl is proving
more complicated than expected.

404
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,590
- He's cooking guinea-fowl?
- Don't even ask.

405
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:53,383
- Hi.
- Hi.

406
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:58,638
- Good Lord, you're the spitting image of...
- Bella, this is Anna.

407
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,976
- Right.
- Okay, crisis over.

408
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,477
Max, this is Anna.

409
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,941
- Hi.
- Hello, Anna... Scott.

410
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,194
- Have some wine.
- Thank you.

411
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,072
I'll get it.

412
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,536
Red or white?

413
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,538
- Hi.
- Hi.

414
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,667
- Oh yes, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

415
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,295
Look, your brother's brought this girl...

416
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,755
Hi, guys.

417
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,673
Holy fuck!

418
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,219
Honey, this is Anna. Anna, this is Honey.
She's my baby sister.

419
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,097
- Hi.
- Oh, God.

420
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:44,643
This is one of those key moments in life
when it's possible

421
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:51,358
you can be really genuinely cool
and I'm going to fail just 100%.

422
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:57,656
I absolutely, totally and utterly adore you.

423
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:02,786
And I just think you are
the most beautiful woman in the world.

424
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,538
And more importantly, I genuinely believe,

425
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:10,752
and I've believed for some time now,
that we could be best friends.

426
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,712
So what do you think?

427
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:17,759
Lucky me.

428
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,099
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, you gave me a present.

429
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,477
We're best friends already then.

430
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,814
Marry Will, he's a really nice guy,
then we can be sisters.

431
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,941
I'll think about it.

432
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,319
That'll be Bernie.

433
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,865
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

434
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,118
Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.

435
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,496
- Millions down the drain.
- Well done.

436
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,039
Bernie, this is Anna.

437
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,375
- Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you.
- And you.

438
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,795
Honey bunny, happy birthday to you.

439
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,880
- Hi, Bella.
- Hi.

440
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,884
It's a hat.
You don't have to wear it or anything.

441
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,345
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

442
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,931
Hi.

443
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,809
- What?

444
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,478
Wine, Bernie?

445
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,148
You haven't slept with her, have you?

446
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,650
That is a cheap question and the answer is,
of course, no comment.

447
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,569
- No comment means "yes."
- No, it doesn't.

448
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,487
- Do you ever masturbate?
- Definitely no comment.

449
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,239
You see, it means "yes."

450
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,449
Oh, my God!

451
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:26,661
So, tell me, Anna, what do you do?

452
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,373
- I'm an actress.
- Oh, splendid.

453
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,294
- What do you do?
- I'm actually in the stock market myself.

454
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,880
So... not really similar fields.

455
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,133
Though I have done
the odd bit of amateur stuff.

456
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,721
P. G. Wodehouse. Farce, all that, you know.

457
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,431
"Careful there, vicar."

458
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,727
Always imagined it's a pretty tough job,
though, acting.

459
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,104
I mean, the wages are a scandal,
aren't they?

460
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,731
They can be.

461
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,318
I see friends from university, clever chaps,
been in the business longer than you.

462
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:02,155
They're scraping by on seven,
eight thousand a year.

463
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,991
It's no life.

464
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,996
- What sort of acting do you do?
- Films mainly.

465
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:14,626
Splendid. Oh, well done.
How's the pay in movies?

466
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,756
I mean, last film you did,
what did you get paid?

467
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,342
$15 million.

468
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,011
Right.

469
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:30,350
So that's... well, fairly good.

470
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,227
Right, I think we're ready.

471
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,855
Bella, can you tell me where I can find...

472
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,483
Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah.
It's down the corridor on the right.

473
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,443
I'll show you. I'll show you.

474
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,659
Quickly, quickly, quickly. Talk very quickly.
What are you doing here with Anna Scott?

475
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,495
- Anna Scott? What, the film star?
- Yes. Shut up.

476
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,830
Shh.

477
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,873
- Oh, God!
- What?

478
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,502
- Oh, God. Oh, goddy God.
- What did you say to her?

479
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,880
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
I actually walked into the loo with her.

480
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,508
I was still chatting
when she started unbuttoning her jeans.

481
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,052
- She had to ask me to leave.
- Oh, God.

482
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,971
So you knew who she was?

483
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,056
Of course I did, but he didn't!

484
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,727
Well, not instantly,
but I got away with it though.

485
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,275
What do you think of the guinea-fowl?

486
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,486
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Oh, God.

487
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,240
So, how's the guinea-fowl?

488
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,035
Best guinea-fowl I've ever tasted.

489
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:09,157
Having you here, Anna,
firmly establishes what I've long suspected,

490
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,201
that we really are the most desperate lot
of under-achievers.

491
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,079
- Shame.
- I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

492
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:18,291
In fact, I think it's something
we should take pride in.

493
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:23,796
I'm gonna give the last brownie as a prize
to the saddest act here.

494
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,633
Bern.

495
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,094
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it?

496
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,514
I mean, I work in the city
in a job I don't understand

497
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,142
and everyone keeps
getting promoted above me.

498
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,103
I haven't had a girlfriend since,
well, since puberty.

499
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,898
And nobody fancies me.

500
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,442
And if these cheeks get any chubbier,
they never will.

501
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,486
Nonsense. I fancy you.

502
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,155
- Really?
- Yeah.

503
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,533
You see.

504
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:56,704
And unless I'm much mistaken
your job still pays you rather a lot of money

505
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,957
whilst Honey here earns 20 pence a week

506
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,292
flogging her guts out
in London's worst record store.

507
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,627
Yes!

508
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,296
And I haven't got hair, I've got feathers.

509
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,217
And I've got funny goggly eyes
and I'm attracted to cruel men.

510
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:14,889
Actually, no one will marry me because
my boosies have actually started shrinking.

511
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,641
You see, it's incredibly sad.

512
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,810
Yeah, but on the other hand
her best friend is Anna Scott.

513
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,146
That's true, I can't deny it.
She needs me. What can I say?

514
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,944
And most of her limbs work whereas
I'm stuck in this thing day and night,

515
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,737
in a house full of ramps.

516
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,156
And to add insult to serious injury

517
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,911
I've totally given up smoking,
my favourite thing.

518
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,918
Well, the truth is, we can't have a baby.

519
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,759
Oh, Belle...

520
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,096
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

521
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,227
Still, we're lucky in lots of ways.

522
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,272
But, surely that's worth a brownie.

523
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,234
Well, I don't know.

524
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,070
Look at William.

525
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,657
- Very unsuccessful professionally.
- That's true.

526
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:15,783
Divorced.

527
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,829
Used to be handsome,
now kind of squidgy round the edges.

528
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,374
And absolutely certain
never to hear from Anna again

529
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,627
once she's heard that
his nickname at school was Floppy.

530
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,464
You did. I can't believe it, you did.

531
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,175
Thanks very much. Thank you.

532
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,094
- Well at least I get the last brownie, right?
- I think so, yes.

533
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,929
Well, wait, what about me?

534
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:40,558
I'm sorry?

535
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,853
You think you deserve the brownie?

536
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,649
- Well, a shot at it at least, huh?
- Right, well, you'll have to prove it.

537
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:52,487
I mean, this is a very, very good brownie
and I'm gonna fight for it.

538
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,532
I've been on a diet every day since I was 19

539
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:00,286
which basically means
I've been hungry for a decade.

540
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,084
I've had a series of not nice boyfriends,
one of whom hit me.

541
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,170
And every time I get my heart broken,

542
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:14,092
the newspapers splash it about
as though it's entertainment.

543
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:22,350
And it's taken two rather painful operations
to get me looking like this.

544
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,852
- Really?
- Really.

545
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:31,275
And one day, not long from now

546
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,530
my looks will go,
they will discover I can't act

547
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:41,202
and I will become some sad,
middle-aged woman who

548
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:45,373
looks a bit like someone
who was famous for a while.

549
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,926
No, nice try, gorgeous,
but you don't fool anyone.

550
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,180
Pathetic effort to hog the brownie.

551
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,852
- Thank you for such a terrific time.
- I'm delighted.

552
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,398
- That's a great tie.
- Now you're lying.

553
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,817
Okay, it's true.
I told you I was bad at acting.

554
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,319
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Yeah. And you.

555
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,656
I'll wait until you've gone
before I tell him you're a vegetarian.

556
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:19,740
No!

557
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,497
- Goodnight.
- I'm sorry about the loo thing.

558
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,541
I meant to leave but I just...

559
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,335
Look, ring me
if you want someone to go shopping with.

560
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,004
I know lots of nice, cheap places.

561
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,506
I mean, not that money is necessarily...

562
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,008
It was just so nice to meet you.

563
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,301
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

564
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,011
You're my style guru.

565
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,929
Sorry, can I just...

566
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,184
Goodnight, everyone.

567
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,145
Max, Belle,
we'll see you in a couple of days.

568
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:53,024
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Anna.

569
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,276
Love your work.

570
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,944
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

571
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,872
Sorry.
They always do that when I leave the house.

572
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:11,292
It's a stupid thing. I hate it.

573
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:25,431
- Floppy, huh?
- It's the hair. It's to do with the hair.

574
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,229
Why is she in a wheelchair?

575
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:35,942
Because she had an accident
about 18 months ago.

576
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,820
And the pregnancy thing,
is that to do with the accident?

577
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:40,905
You know, I'm not sure.

578
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:44,492
I don't think they tried for kids before,
as fate would have it.

579
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,627
Do you want to...

580
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,089
My place is just...

581
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,841
Too complicated.

582
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,969
That's fine.

583
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,518
Busy tomorrow?

584
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,815
- I thought you were leaving tomorrow.
- I was.

585
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:20,653
All these streets round here

586
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,614
have these mysterious communal gardens
in the middle of them.

587
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,200
- They're like little villages.
- Let's go in.

588
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,744
No, that's the point. They're private villages.

589
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,956
Only the people who live round the edges
are allowed in.

590
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:37,461
- You abide by rules like that?
- I don't, no, no, but others do.

591
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,255
And I just do what I want.

592
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,551
Right.

593
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,847
Whoopsidaisies.

594
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,350
What did you say?

595
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,186
- Nothing.
- Yes, you did.

596
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:58,232
- No, I didn't.
- You said "whoopsidaisies."

597
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,485
No one says "whoopsidaisies," do they?
I mean, unless they're...

598
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,528
There is no "unless."

599
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,989
Because no one has said "whoopsidaisies"
for 50 years.

600
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:09,452
And even then it was
just little girls with blonde ringlets.

601
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,287
Exactly. Right.

602
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,081
So here we go again.

603
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:18,002
Whoopsidaisies.

604
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,381
Yeah, well, it's a disease.
It's a clinical thing.

605
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:26,052
I'm taking pills and having injections.
And I'm told it won't last long so...

606
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:29,180
- Okay, stand aside.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

607
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,767
Really, it's quite tricky. Anna.

608
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:38,064
Anna, don't, it's harder than it...
No, it's not. It's easy.

609
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:48,282
Come on, Flopsy.

610
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,494
Right. Right!

611
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,957
Oh, bugger.

612
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,836
Oh, God. This could be very unpleasant.

613
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,052
Bugger, bugger.

614
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:16,477
Now what in the world in this garden
could make that ordeal worthwhile?

615
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,701
Nice garden.

616
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:11,532
"For June who loved this garden,
from Joseph who always sat beside her."

617
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:19,039
Some people
do spend their whole lives together.

618
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,201
Come and sit with me.

619
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,925
Bollocks. Bollocks. Bollocks!

620
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:14,136
- Have you seen my glasses?
- No, afraid not.

621
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,305
Big, big bollocks!

622
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:20,100
Average day, my glasses are everywhere.
Everywhere I look there's a pair of glasses.

623
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,311
But when I want to go to the cinema
they've vanished.

624
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,355
It's one of life's real cruelties.

625
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:28,817
That's compared to, like, earthquakes
in the Far East or testicular cancer, is it?

626
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,111
Oh, shit, is that the time?

627
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:35,074
Thanks for all your help
on the glasses thing.

628
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,409
Oh, you're welcome. Did you find them?

629
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:39,453
- Sort of.
- Great.

630
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:13,195
- So who left who?
- She left me.

631
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,738
Why?

632
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:19,577
- She saw through me.
- That's not good.

633
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,163
You can give me Anna Scott any day.

634
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:26,792
I didn't like her last film.
Fell asleep as soon as the lights went down.

635
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,086
I don't really care what the film's like.

636
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,755
Any film with her in, it's fine by me.

637
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,801
She's not my type at all.
I prefer that other one.

638
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,220
You know, blonde, sweet looking.

639
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,264
You know, what's her name?

640
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,100
Has an orgasm every time
you take her out for a cup of coffee.

641
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,435
Meg Ryan.

642
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,437
No, she's too wholesome.

643
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,482
You see, the point about Miss Scott
is she's got that twinkle in her eye.

644
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:54,403
Probably drug-induced.
Spends most of her life in bloody rehab.

645
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,947
Well, whatever. She's so clearly up for it.

646
00:51:57,031 --> 00:52:00,576
I mean, you see, most girls,
they're all like, "Stay away, chum."

647
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,288
She is absolutely gagging for it.

648
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,584
Do you know that in over 50% of languages

649
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,795
the word for "actress"
is the same as the word for "prostitute"?

650
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,214
Where did you get that from?

651
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:19,219
And Anna is your definitive actress,

652
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,724
someone really filthy
you can just flip over and start again.

653
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:29,063
- Right, that's it. Sorry.
- No, no. There's really no point.

654
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,693
Sorry, sorry to disturb you guys but...

655
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,570
- Can I help?
- Well, yeah.

656
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,740
I wish I hadn't overheard your conversation,
but I did.

657
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:45,079
And, I just think, you know the person
you're talking about is a real person

658
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,165
and I think she probably
deserves a little bit more consideration

659
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:51,752
rather than having jerks like you
drooling over her.

660
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,797
Oh, sod off, mate. What are you, her dad?

661
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,139
- I'm sorry.
- No, I love that you tried.

662
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:07,059
Time was I'd have done the same thing.
In fact...

663
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,274
Hi.

664
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,819
Oh, my God!

665
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:20,614
I just wanted to apologise for my friend.
He's very sensitive.

666
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,702
No, no, no, leave it.
I'm sure you didn't mean any harm.

667
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,162
I'm sure it was just friendly banter.

668
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:29,456
I'm sure you guys
have dicks the size of peanuts.

669
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,042
Enjoy your dinner. The tuna's really good.

670
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:39,007
I shouldn't have done that.
I shouldn't have done that.

671
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:42,094
- No, you were brilliant.
- I'm rash and I am stupid.

672
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,222
What am I doing with you?

673
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,683
I don't know, I'm afraid.

674
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:49,810
I don't either.

675
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,941
Here we are.

676
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,026
Yes.

677
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,281
- Well look...
- Do you wanna come up?

678
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:10,330
Well, there seems to be lots of
reasons why I shouldn't, so...

679
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,249
There are lots of reasons.

680
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:18,338
Do you wanna come up?

681
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,012
Give me five minutes?

682
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:43,947
- Hi.
- Hi.

683
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,245
To be able to do that
is such a wonderful thing.

684
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,414
- You've got to go.
- Why?

685
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:57,711
Because my boyfriend, who was in America,
is, in fact, now in the next room.

686
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,129
- Boyfriend?
- Yes.

687
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,882
- Hey, baby, who is it?
- It's...

688
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:07,846
Room service.

689
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:09,807
How are you doing?

690
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,768
I thought you guys
always wore those penguin coats?

691
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,062
Usually we do.

692
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,773
But I was just changed to go home.

693
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:22,152
And then I thought I'd take this final call.

694
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,572
Oh, great. If you don't mind,
I would like something, too.

695
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,617
Could you bring me up some really,
really cold water?

696
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,454
- I'll see what I can do.
- Still, not sparkling.

697
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,665
Absolutely. Ice-cold still water.

698
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:38,836
Unless, of course, it's illegal in the UK
to serve beverages below room temperature.

699
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:41,797
I wouldn't want you going to jail
just to satisfy my whim, now.

700
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,882
- I'm sure it's fine.
- Thank you.

701
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,344
Hey, one more thing, if you don't mind,

702
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,889
<i>could you adiós these dirty dishes
and take out that trash, too?</i>

703
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:57,312
- Right.
- No. No. Don't do that.

704
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:59,857
I don't think it's his job to clear.

705
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,235
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What's your name, man?

706
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,197
Bernie.

707
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:11,618
Oh, listen, Bernie, thank you,
I really appreciate it.

708
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,037
Hey, you...

709
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:23,505
So, tell me, tell me, tell me.
Good surprise or nasty surprise?

710
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,343
- Good surprise.
- Oh, you're such a liar. She hates surprises.

711
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,345
Hey, what are you gonna order?

712
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,098
From him. What are you gonna order?

713
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,810
- I haven't decided yet.
- Well, don't overdo it.

714
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,437
I don't want people saying,

715
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,815
"There goes that famous actor
with the big fat girlfriend."

716
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,193
I should leave.

717
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:55,329
This is a fairly strange reality
to be faced with.

718
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,248
I'm so sorry.

719
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:05,005
I don't know what to say.

720
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:12,512
I think "goodbye" is traditional.

721
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:20,265
Come on. Open up.

722
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,393
This is me.

723
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,063
Spikey.

724
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:31,651
I'm in contact with some
quite important spiritual vibrations.

725
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:36,782
Come on. Hit me with it.

726
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,329
There's this girl.

727
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,334
See, I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.

728
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,753
Speak on, dear friend.

729
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:54,299
She's someone who can't be mine,

730
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:02,557
and it's as if I've taken "love heroin"
and now I can't ever have it again.

731
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:07,187
I've opened Pandora's Box
and there's this trouble inside.

732
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,275
Yeah.

733
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:15,112
Tricky.

734
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,489
Tricky.

735
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,411
I knew a girl at school called Pandora.

736
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,708
Never got to see her box though.

737
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:31,670
Right.

738
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,881
Right, thanks, that's very helpful.

739
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,678
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?

740
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:44,766
No. No. Why, did you?

741
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,728
Oh, bloody hell, I don't believe it.

742
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:52,899
<i>My whole life ruined
because I don't read Hello! magazine.</i>

743
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:57,571
Let's face facts.
This was always a no-win situation.

744
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,949
Anna's a goddess.

745
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,703
You know what happens to mortals
who get involved with the gods.

746
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,037
Buggered, is it?

747
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:07,497
Every time.

748
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:11,585
But don't despair,
I think I have the solution to your problems.

749
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,503
Really?

750
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,840
Her name is Tessa,
and she works in the contracts department.

751
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:20,427
The hair, I admit, is unfashionably frizzy.

752
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,890
But she's bright as a button, and kisses
like a nymphomaniac on death row.

753
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,349
Apparently.

754
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:30,812
Now, try.

755
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:38,445
I got completely lost.
It's real difficult, isn't it?

756
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,738
Everything's got the word Kensington in it.

757
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,073
Kensington Park Road.
Kensington Gardens.

758
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,575
Kensington bloody Park Gardens.

759
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:47,204
- Look, Tessa, this is Bella, my wife.
- Hello. You're in a wheelchair.

760
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:50,790
- Yeah, that's right.
- And this is William.

761
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,001
- Hello, William.
- Hi.

762
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:54,961
Max has told me everything about you.

763
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:58,423
- Has he?
- Oh, yes. You are a naughty boy.

764
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,009
- Wine?
- Oh, yes, please.

765
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,345
Come on, Willie, let's get sloshed.

766
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,805
- Red or white?
- Red.

767
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,601
Keziah...

768
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,063
Some woodcock?

769
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,482
No, thank you, I'm a fruitarian.

770
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,197
What is a fruitarian exactly?

771
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:27,786
Well, we believe that fruits and vegetables
have feelings, so we think cooking is cruel.

772
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:32,540
We only eat things that have actually fallen
from the tree or bush.

773
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:34,960
That are, in fact, dead already.

774
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,257
Oh, right.

775
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,133
Right.

776
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:45,095
So, these carrots...

777
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,055
Have been murdered, yes.

778
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,431
Murdered?

779
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:53,561
Gosh, poor old carrots. That's beastly.

780
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,526
Delicious coffee.

781
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,029
I'm sorry about the lamb.

782
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:07,701
No, I thought it was really, you know,
interesting.

783
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,704
"Interesting" means "inedible."

784
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:14,082
Really inedible, yes, you're right.

785
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:20,880
Well, maybe we'll meet again.

786
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:26,052
Yeah. Yeah. That'll be great.

787
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,146
Bye.

788
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,250
Well?

789
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:01,421
Perfect. Absolutely perfect.

790
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,092
And?

791
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:12,432
You see, I think you've forgotten
what an unusual situation you two have.

792
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,478
To find someone you actually love,

793
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:20,732
who'll love you, I mean,
the chances are always minuscule.

794
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:26,196
Look at me. Apart from the American,

795
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,782
I've only loved two girls,
both total disasters.

796
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,367
- That's not fair.
- No, really.

797
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:34,662
One of them marries me then leaves me
faster than you can say "Indiana Jones."

798
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:38,166
And the other,
who seriously ought to have known better,

799
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,377
casually marries my best friend.

800
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,711
She still loves you though.

801
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,297
Yeah, in a depressingly asexual way.

802
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,052
I never fancied you much, actually.

803
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,471
Oh, God.

804
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:57,894
I loved you, you were terribly funny,
but all that kissing my ears...

805
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,897
I don't believe it. This is just getting worse.

806
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:05,110
I shall find myself 30 years from now
still sitting on this sofa.

807
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,070
Do you wanna stay?

808
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,280
Yeah, why not.

809
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:12,826
All that awaits me at home
is a masturbating Welshman.

810
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,330
Here we go.

811
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,167
- Goodnight.
- Night.

812
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,813
- See you, Will.
- Right. Right.

813
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:54,075
- Guilty. Very, very guilty.
- So it seems.

814
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:42,582
Hi.

815
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,462
Can I come in?

816
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,088
Come in.

817
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:00,600
They were taken years ago.

818
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,310
I know it was...

819
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:07,357
But I was poor and it happens a lot.

820
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:10,652
That's not an excuse. I just...

821
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:18,701
But to make matters worse,
it now appears as though

822
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:23,998
someone was filming me as well.

823
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:29,879
So what was a stupid photo shoot
now looks like a porn film.

824
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:37,178
And the pictures have been sold,
and they're just everywhere.

825
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:43,142
I didn't know where to go.

826
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,772
The hotel's surrounded.

827
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,153
I know it's been months but...

828
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,990
This is the place.

829
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,411
Thank you.

830
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:11,129
I'm just in London for two days,
but what with your papers,

831
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,339
it's the worst place to be.

832
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:17,969
I mean, these pictures are just so horrible
and they're so grainy.

833
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:21,848
- And it makes me look like...
- Listen, don't think about it.

834
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:25,977
We'll sort it out.

835
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,441
Now what would you like?

836
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,694
Tea? Bath?

837
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,196
Yeah.

838
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,035
A bath would be great.

839
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:47,123
Oh, Christ alive!

840
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:54,547
Brilliant. Fantastic.

841
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,010
Magnificent.

842
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,895
You must be Spike.

843
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:23,576
Hi.

844
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,162
Just checking.

845
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,128
Thank you, God.

846
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:40,510
I'm really sorry about last time.

847
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:44,430
I mean, he just flew in. I had no idea.

848
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:49,060
In fact, I had no idea
if he was ever gonna fly in again.

849
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:52,980
Listen, it's not often
one has the opportunity to

850
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:55,483
<i>adiós the plates
of a major Hollywood film star.</i>

851
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:58,277
It was thrilling for me.

852
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,700
So how is he?

853
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,620
I don't know.

854
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:13,042
It just got to the point
where I couldn't remember

855
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:15,878
any of the reasons why we were together.

856
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,382
And you and love?

857
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:26,973
Oh, well, there's a question
without an interesting answer.

858
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,897
I have thought about you.

859
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:42,822
It's just that any time I've tried to keep

860
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:47,285
anything normal
with a person that was normal,

861
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,245
it's just been a disaster.

862
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:52,457
Yeah, no, listen,
I appreciate that, absolutely.

863
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,461
So what is that, a film you're doing?

864
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,464
I start in LA on Tuesday.

865
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:03,801
Would you like me
to take you through your lines?

866
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,929
Would you? Because it's all talk, talk, talk.

867
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:11,142
Come on, hand it over. Right.

868
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:13,978
Basic plot?

869
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:18,608
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer,
who in about 20 minutes

870
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,694
is gonna save the world
from nuclear disaster.

871
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,113
Okay, well done, you.

872
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,449
"Message from Command,
would you like them to send in the HK's?"

873
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,326
No. Turn over four TRS's

874
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:32,205
and tell them we need radar feedback
before the KFT's return at 19:00.

875
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,248
Then inform the Pentagon we need
Black Star cover

876
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:36,125
from 10:00 through 12:15.

877
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,335
And if you say one word about

878
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:39,670
how many mistakes I made in that speech,
I'll pelt you with olives.

879
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,589
"Very well, Captain,
I'll pass that on, straight away."

880
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,800
Thank you. How many mistakes did I make?

881
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:44,884
Eleven.

882
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:48,679
- Dammit. And, Wainwright...
- Cartwright.

883
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:51,265
Cartwright, Wainwright,
whatever your name is...

884
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,309
I promised little Jimmy
I'd be home for his birthday,

885
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,770
so could you get a message to him
that I may be a little late?

886
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:58,648
"Certainly." And little Johnny?

887
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,858
- My son's name is Johnny?
- Yeah.

888
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:02,568
Well, then get a message to him, too.

889
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,404
"I'll do what I can, Captain,
but I can't promise anything."

890
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,448
And, Cartwright goes.

891
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,077
What do you think?

892
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,247
Gripping. You know, it's not Jane Austen.

893
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,083
It's not Henry James. But it's gripping.

894
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,252
Think I should do Henry James instead?

895
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,003
Well, I think you would be brilliant
in Henry James

896
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:24,507
but, you know, this writer... Writers...

897
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,425
They're pretty damn good, too.

898
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:29,053
<i>Well, you never get anyone
in Wings of the Dove saying,</i>

899
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,722
"Inform the Pentagon,
we need Black Star cover."

900
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:34,934
Well, and for me,
the book is the poorer for it.

901
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,858
I can't believe you have that picture.

902
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,986
You like Chagall?

903
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,071
I do.

904
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,825
It feels like how love should be.

905
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:52,952
Floating through a dark blue sky.

906
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,747
With a goat, playing a violin.

907
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,124
Well, yes.

908
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,752
Happiness isn't happiness
without a violin-playing goat.

909
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:24,692
You have big feet.

910
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:30,698
Yes. Yes, always have had.

911
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:36,120
You know what they say
about men with big feet?

912
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:40,207
No, I don't know. What's that?

913
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:46,213
Big feet, large shoes.

914
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,680
The thing that's so irritating is that now

915
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,391
I'm so totally fierce
when it comes to nudity clauses.

916
01:13:57,475 --> 01:14:00,519
You actually have clauses in your contract
about nudity?

917
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,104
Definitely.

918
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:06,609
You may show the dent of the top
of the artist's buttocks but neither cheek.

919
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:11,697
Or, if there's a stunt bottom being used,
artist must have full consultation.

920
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:13,991
You have a stunt bottom?

921
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:17,203
Well, I could have a stunt bottom, yes.

922
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:21,791
And are people tempted to go for
better bottoms than their own.

923
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:25,086
Yeah. I mean, I would.
This is important stuff.

924
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:29,131
Well, it's one hell of a job, isn't it?
I mean, what do you put on your passport?

925
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:31,550
Profession. Mel Gibson's bottom.

926
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,886
Actually, Mel does his own ass work.

927
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:34,971
Right.

928
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:37,598
- Why wouldn't he?
- Absolutely.

929
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:40,017
It's delicious.

930
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,562
What, the ice cream
or Mel Gibson's bottom?

931
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:46,315
Both. Equally.

932
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:49,068
But you wouldn't necessarily lick both?

933
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,903
Well, this is tart.

934
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:54,991
And fuzz free.

935
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:04,375
And...
The bedroom, I've put clean sheets on.

936
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:17,096
Today's been a good day.

937
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:21,767
Which in the circumstances is unexpected.

938
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:24,812
Thank you.

939
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:33,362
Anyway, time for bed.

940
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,783
Or, sofa bed.

941
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:46,709
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

942
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:35,132
Oh, my God.

943
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,226
Hello?

944
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:48,521
Hello.

945
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:50,689
Spike?

946
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:54,026
I wonder if I could have a little word?

947
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:56,570
- Right.
- I don't want to interfere or nothing,

948
01:16:56,654 --> 01:17:00,199
but she's just split up from her boyfriend.
That's right, innit?

949
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:01,450
Maybe.

950
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,744
And she's in your house.

951
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:06,038
Yes?

952
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:08,541
And you get on very well.

953
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:11,168
Yes.

954
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:15,214
Well, isn't this perhaps
a nice opportunity to

955
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:21,971
- slip her one?
- Spike, for God's sake. She's in trouble.

956
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:23,097
Just get a grip.

957
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,475
Right, you think it's the wrong moment,
fair enough.

958
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,022
Do you mind if I have a go?

959
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:33,983
- Spike!
- Right, okay.

960
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:36,318
I'll talk to you in the morning.

961
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:39,488
Okay. Might be too late, but okay.

962
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,752
Please, sod off.

963
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:55,171
- Okay, sorry.
- No.

964
01:17:55,254 --> 01:18:00,092
No, no, no, wait,
I thought you were someone else.

965
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:05,139
I thought you were Spike.
I'm thrilled that you're not.

966
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:08,202
Wow.

967
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:12,373
What?

968
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:15,251
Nothing.

969
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:56,458
It does strike me as, well, surreal
that I'm allowed to see you naked.

970
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,585
You and every person in this country.

971
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,462
God, yeah, I'm sorry.

972
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:06,051
What is it about men and nudity?
Particularly breasts.

973
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:09,888
And how can you be so interested in them?

974
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:13,434
- Well...
- No, but seriously. They're just breasts.

975
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:16,270
Every second person in the world has them.

976
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:18,022
Well, more than that, actually,
when you think about it.

977
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:20,899
You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair.

978
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:25,112
But they're odd looking. They're for milk.

979
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:28,907
Your mother has them.
You've seen a thousand of them.

980
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:31,076
What's all the fuss about?

981
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:35,748
Actually, I can't think what it is, really.
Let me just have a quick look.

982
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:42,546
No, no, beats me.

983
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:49,094
Rita Hayworth used to say,

984
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:53,849
"They go to bed with Gilda,
they wake up with me."

985
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,435
Who was Gilda?

986
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:58,437
Her most famous part.

987
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:02,441
Men went to bed with the dream,

988
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,778
and they didn't like it
when they woke up with reality.

989
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,448
Do you feel that way?

990
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:15,829
You are Iovelier this morning
than you have ever been.

991
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,585
I'll be right back.

992
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:36,809
Breakfast in bed.

993
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:40,938
Or it's brunch, or lunch, or something.

994
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:42,606
My God.

995
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,485
Can I stay a bit longer?

996
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:50,823
Stay forever.

997
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:54,660
Okay.

998
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,787
I forgot the jam.

999
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:03,001
I'll get the jam, you get the door.

1000
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,935
Jesus Christ.

1001
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,440
What?

1002
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:27,401
What is it?

1003
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:31,196
- Nothing, really.
- You're up to something.

1004
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,614
Anna, no, please.

1005
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,036
Oh, my God.

1006
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,832
And they got a picture of you
dressed like that.

1007
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,083
Yes.

1008
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:47,212
Undressed like this, yeah.

1009
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:50,382
Morning, darling ones.

1010
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:54,511
It's me. The press are here.
No, there are hundreds of them.

1011
01:22:54,970 --> 01:23:00,559
My brilliant plan was not so brilliant.
I know. I know. I know. Just get over here.

1012
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:01,977
Dammit.

1013
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:11,028
- I wouldn't go outside.
- Why not?

1014
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:15,908
Just take my word for it.

1015
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:43,185
How did I look? Not bad. Not at all bad.

1016
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:47,356
Well-chosen briefs, I'd say.
Chicks love grey.

1017
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:50,609
Nice, firm buttocks.

1018
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,698
How are you doing?

1019
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,951
How do you think I'm doing?

1020
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:03,288
- I don't know what happened.
- Oh, I do.

1021
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:08,293
Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck
or two, telling the papers where I was.

1022
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:09,878
- That's not true.
- Really?

1023
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:12,214
The entire British press got up this morning
and thought,

1024
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:13,590
"I know where Anna Scott is.

1025
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:16,593
"She's in that house with the blue door
in Notting Hill."

1026
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:19,388
And then you go out
in your goddamn underwear.

1027
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:22,224
- I went out in my goddamn underwear, too.
- Get out.

1028
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,850
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1029
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:25,435
I'm so sorry.

1030
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,522
This is such an unbelievable mess.

1031
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:31,483
I come to you to protect myself
against more crappy gossip,

1032
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:36,363
and now I've just landed in it all over again.
I mean, for God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.

1033
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:37,573
You have?

1034
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:40,200
Well, as far as they're concerned I do. Yes.

1035
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:41,868
And now, tomorrow, there'll be pictures

1036
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:45,038
of you in every newspaper
from here to Timbuktu.

1037
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:48,125
I know that. But let's stay calm.

1038
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:49,710
- No, you can stay calm!
- Right.

1039
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:52,045
All right,
this is a perfect situation for you, isn't it?

1040
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:54,339
Minimum input, maximum publicity.

1041
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:58,760
Everywhere you go people will say,
"Oh, well done. You slept with that actress.

1042
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:00,721
"We saw the pictures."

1043
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,473
That is spectacularly unfair.

1044
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,809
Who knows, maybe it'll even help business.

1045
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:08,478
"Buy a boring book about Egypt
from the guy that screwed Anna Scott."

1046
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:13,400
Now, stop. Stop. Stop, I beg you.
Calm down.

1047
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:17,070
- Have a cup of tea.
- I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.

1048
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:19,615
I just wanna go home.

1049
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:24,870
Spike, see who that is.
And put some clothes on, for God's sake.

1050
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,830
Looks like a chauffeur to me.

1051
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:28,999
Spike owes you an expensive dinner.
Or holiday.

1052
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:32,002
Depending if he's got the brains
to get the going rate on betrayal.

1053
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:36,340
That is not true. Wait a minute.
This is crazy behaviour.

1054
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:40,052
Can't we just laugh about all this?

1055
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:43,889
Seriously, in the huge sweep of things,
this stuff doesn't matter.

1056
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:47,225
What he's gonna say next is
there's people starving in the Sudan.

1057
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:51,271
Well, there are. And we don't have to go
anywhere near that far.

1058
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:52,522
My best friend slipped.

1059
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:54,232
She slipped down stairs, cracked her back,

1060
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:56,818
and she's in a wheelchair
for the rest of her life.

1061
01:25:56,902 --> 01:26:00,781
You know, all I'm asking for
is a normal amount of perspective.

1062
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,825
You're right. Of course, you're right.

1063
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:06,703
It's just that I've dealt
with this garbage for 10 years.

1064
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:11,917
You've had it for 10 minutes.
Our perspectives are very different.

1065
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:15,671
I mean, today's newspapers will be
lining tomorrow's wastepaper bins.

1066
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,297
Excuse me?

1067
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,800
Well, you know, it's just one day.

1068
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:23,720
Tomorrow, today's papers
will all have been thrown out.

1069
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:28,475
You really don't get it.
This story will be filed.

1070
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:31,853
Every time anyone writes
anything about me,

1071
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:33,730
they'll dig up these photos.

1072
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:37,776
Newspapers last forever.
I'll regret this forever.

1073
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,072
Right.

1074
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:46,993
Right.

1075
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:51,957
I will feel the opposite, if that's okay by you.

1076
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:57,963
And always be glad that you came to stay.

1077
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,550
But...

1078
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:05,011
You're probably right. You'd better go.

1079
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:47,387
Was it you?

1080
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:54,352
I may have told a few people down the pub.

1081
01:27:57,063 --> 01:27:58,231
Right.

1082
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,719
Have I got something for you.

1083
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,345
Something which will
make you love me so much,

1084
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:55,849
you will want to hug me every day
for the rest of my life.

1085
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:57,726
Blimey, what is it?

1086
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:03,440
Phone number of Anna Scott's agent
in London and her agent in New York.

1087
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:11,823
Listen, you think about her all the time.
Now you can ring her.

1088
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:14,701
Yeah. Brilliant, thanks.

1089
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:18,371
I'll see you tonight. Hi, Marty. Sexy cardi.

1090
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:48,443
Hello. I have a little speech to make.

1091
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:51,488
I won't stand up
because I can't be bothered.

1092
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:55,617
Exactly a year ago today,

1093
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:58,620
this man here started
the finest restaurant in London.

1094
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,038
- Hear, hear.
- Thank you very much.

1095
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,749
Unfortunately, no one ever came to eat here.

1096
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:04,626
It's a tiny hiccough.

1097
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:07,420
And so, we have to face the fact that

1098
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:11,091
from next week,
we must find somewhere new to eat.

1099
01:31:12,342 --> 01:31:15,720
I just want to say to Tony,
don't take it personally.

1100
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:20,642
The more I think about things,
the more I see no rhyme or reason in life.

1101
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:24,604
No one knows why some things work out
and some things don't.

1102
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:28,233
Why some of us get lucky, and some of us...

1103
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:30,360
- Get fired.
- What?

1104
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:33,905
Yeah, well, it seems
they're shifting the whole outfit

1105
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,700
much more towards the emerging markets.

1106
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:40,495
And of course, well, I was total crap, so...

1107
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:43,498
A toast to Bernie,
the worst stockbroker in the whole world.

1108
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:46,292
I thank you.
And Tony, the worst restaurateur.

1109
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:49,963
- Tony and Bernie. Both crap.
- The terrible two.

1110
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:52,090
In their own special ways.

1111
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:59,055
Since it's an evening of announcements,
I've also got one.

1112
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:03,852
I've decided to get engaged.

1113
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:07,939
I've found myself a nice,
slightly odd-looking bloke.

1114
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:12,986
Who I know is gonna make me happy
for the rest of my life.

1115
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,823
Well, wait a sec. I mean...

1116
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:19,451
I'm your brother.
I don't know anything about this.

1117
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:23,038
Is he...
I don't know, is he financially viable?

1118
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:27,167
He's an artist with brilliant prospects.

1119
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:31,463
This is a secret
you've been keeping from me?

1120
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,214
No. No. I swear.

1121
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:35,133
By the way, it's you.

1122
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:39,512
Me?

1123
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,265
What do you think?

1124
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:44,476
Well, yeah.

1125
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,772
Groovy.

1126
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:54,986
Excuse me,
are there any more announcements?

1127
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:57,113
Well, actually, yes.

1128
01:32:57,197 --> 01:33:01,993
I feel I should apologise to everyone
for my behaviour over the last six months.

1129
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:05,830
I have, as you know,
been somewhat down in the mouth.

1130
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:08,500
Well, there's an understatement.
There are dead people on better form.

1131
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:13,421
But I just wish to make it clear
that I've turned a corner,

1132
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:17,467
and henceforward
intend to be impressively happy.

1133
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:42,450
Oh, God, I'm horribly drunk.

1134
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:44,869
Me, too.

1135
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:46,621
Come here.

1136
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:52,836
So you've laid the ghost?

1137
01:33:55,004 --> 01:33:56,673
I believe I have.

1138
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:59,634
Don't give a damn about the famous girl?

1139
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:03,721
No. No, I don't think I do.

1140
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:08,226
Which means you won't be distracted by
the fact that she's back in London,

1141
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:09,727
grasping her Oscar,

1142
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:13,857
and currently to be found filming,
most days, on Hampstead Heath.

1143
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:16,234
Oh, God, no.

1144
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:22,532
So, not over her, in fact.

1145
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:08,286
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

1146
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,705
I'm looking for Anna Scott.

1147
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:13,166
- Does she know you're coming?
- No.

1148
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,460
No, she doesn't.

1149
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:17,462
I'm afraid I can't let you through, sir.

1150
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:22,008
Right. I mean, I am actually a friend.
I'm not a lunatic.

1151
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:27,096
- But no, you basically...
- Can't let you through, sir.

1152
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,265
Well, this is...

1153
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:13,184
I only found out you were here yesterday.

1154
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:17,438
- Well, I was going to call, but I...
- Anna.

1155
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:18,564
Yes.

1156
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:22,110
Things aren't going very well
and it's our last day.

1157
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:24,612
Absolutely, yeah, you're clearly very busy.

1158
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:30,034
But if you could wait,
there are things to say.

1159
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:36,165
Okay.

1160
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:41,170
Drink tea. There's lots of tea.

1161
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:50,388
Come and have a look.

1162
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,561
Are you a fan of Henry James?

1163
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:59,939
- This is a Henry James film?
- Yeah.

1164
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:09,657
This is Harry.

1165
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:13,036
He'll give you a pair of headphones,
so you can hear the dialogue.

1166
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,704
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

1167
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:18,750
- Hi.
- Hi, here we go. Volume's on the side.

1168
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:21,210
- There. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

1169
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:33,097
<i>We are living in cloud cuckoo land.
We'll never get this done today.</i>

1170
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:35,016
<i>Well, we've got to.
I have to be in New York on Thursday.</i>

1171
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:36,768
Stop showing off.

1172
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:39,812
God, that's an enormous arse.

1173
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:41,606
<i>I'm not listening.</i>

1174
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:43,691
<i>No, but seriously, it's not fair.</i>

1175
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:46,694
So many tragic young teenagers
with anorexia,

1176
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:48,863
and that girl has an arse she could
perfectly well share around

1177
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:52,492
with at least 10 other women,
and still be big bottomed.

1178
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:54,994
I would think,
looking at something nice like that,

1179
01:37:55,078 --> 01:38:01,042
you and your bony little excuse for an arse
would be well advised to keep quiet.

1180
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:04,379
Now, down to business,
the end of the scene.

1181
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:07,799
I ask you when you're telling everyone,
and you say...

1182
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,302
"Tomorrow will be soon enough."

1183
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:14,097
And then I... Right, okay.

1184
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:18,184
So who was that rather diffident chap
I saw you talking to round the back?

1185
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:19,477
No one.

1186
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:23,689
Just some guy from the past.

1187
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:28,986
It's a bit of an awkward situation really.
I don't know what he's doing here.

1188
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:46,671
Of course.

1189
01:38:53,386 --> 01:38:57,348
- Thanks, I've got to...
- Any time.

1190
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:11,195
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, can we have
you all on your first marks, please.</i>

1191
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:13,030
<i>On your first marks.</i>

1192
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:28,921
I do hate to disturb you
whilst you're cooking the books,

1193
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:31,382
but there's a delivery for you.

1194
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,927
Martin, really, can't you just do it yourself?

1195
01:39:35,011 --> 01:39:38,473
But you see, this is not for the shop.
This is for you.

1196
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:42,101
Right, okay.

1197
01:39:42,185 --> 01:39:47,106
Now tell me, if I employed a wet rag,
would I have to pay it as much as I pay you?

1198
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:51,819
Hi.

1199
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:55,072
Hello.

1200
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:57,950
You disappeared.

1201
01:39:58,034 --> 01:40:01,287
Yeah. Yeah, I had to leave.

1202
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:04,165
I didn't want to disturb.

1203
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:06,250
How have you been?

1204
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:07,585
Fine. Fine.

1205
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:09,128
I don't know, everything much the same,
you know.

1206
01:40:09,212 --> 01:40:13,007
When they change the law,
Spike and I will marry immediately.

1207
01:40:13,591 --> 01:40:17,345
Whereas you, I've watched in wonder.
Awards, glory.

1208
01:40:17,637 --> 01:40:21,349
Oh, no, it's all nonsense, believe me.

1209
01:40:21,933 --> 01:40:26,521
I'd no idea how much nonsense it was,
but nonsense it all is.

1210
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:33,945
Well, yesterday was our last day of filming,

1211
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:36,614
so I'm leaving.

1212
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:39,700
But...

1213
01:40:42,912 --> 01:40:47,375
I brought this for you from home.
So I thought I'd give it to you.

1214
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:51,462
Thank you.

1215
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:55,800
- Shall I...
- Oh, no, don't open it now,

1216
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:57,635
I'll be embarrassed.

1217
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:03,641
Well, thank you. I don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

1218
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:07,603
I actually had it in my apartment.
I thought you...

1219
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:12,233
But when it came to it,

1220
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:15,820
I didn't know how to call,
having behaved so badly.

1221
01:41:16,529 --> 01:41:17,738
Twice.

1222
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:22,868
So it's just been sitting in the hotel.

1223
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:27,957
Then you came, and I figured...

1224
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:33,879
The thing is...

1225
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:36,882
The thing is...

1226
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,721
What? What is the thing?

1227
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:47,101
Don't even think about it.
Go away, immediately. Go away.

1228
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:49,186
Right. Sorry.

1229
01:41:53,608 --> 01:41:55,234
You were saying?

1230
01:41:57,612 --> 01:41:58,696
Yes.

1231
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:05,703
I have to go away today,
but I wondered if I didn't,

1232
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:10,708
whether you might let me see you a little,

1233
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:14,629
or a lot, maybe.

1234
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:20,635
See if you could like me again.

1235
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:23,929
But yesterday that actor asked you
who I was

1236
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:26,682
and you just dismissed me out of hand.

1237
01:42:27,808 --> 01:42:29,060
I heard.

1238
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:33,981
You had a microphone, I had headphones.

1239
01:42:34,065 --> 01:42:36,484
What, you expect me
to tell the truth about my life

1240
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:39,236
to the most indiscreet man in England?

1241
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:44,533
Excuse me. It's your mother on the phone.

1242
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:50,498
Will you tell her I'll ring her back, please?

1243
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:53,459
I've actually tried that tack,
but she said you've said that once before,

1244
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:55,378
and it's now been about 24 hours

1245
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:58,881
and the foot that was purple
is now sort of blackish in colour and...

1246
01:42:58,964 --> 01:43:02,426
Right, right, yeah. Perfect timing as ever.

1247
01:43:04,804 --> 01:43:07,139
Martin, hold the fort a second.

1248
01:43:08,933 --> 01:43:10,476
Yes, all right.

1249
01:43:16,982 --> 01:43:22,196
<i>Could I just say, I thought Ghost
was the most wonderful film.</i>

1250
01:43:24,073 --> 01:43:25,533
Is that right?

1251
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:26,826
Oh, yes.

1252
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:36,919
I've always wondered
what Patrick Swayze's like in real life.

1253
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,715
I can't say that I know Patrick all that well.

1254
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:43,384
What, he wasn't that friendly during filming?

1255
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:48,764
<i>Well, I'm sure he was friendly to Demi Moore
who acted with him in Ghost.</i>

1256
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:54,645
Oh, right. Sorry.

1257
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:58,566
Right. Always been a bit of an ass.

1258
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:05,906
Anyway, well, it was lovely to meet you.

1259
01:44:06,031 --> 01:44:11,120
I'm a huge fan of yours.
And Demi's of course.

1260
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:15,916
Sorry about that.

1261
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:18,169
That's fine.

1262
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:22,673
There's always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict.

1263
01:44:24,633 --> 01:44:26,093
Anna, look...

1264
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:30,097
I'm a fairly level-headed bloke.

1265
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:36,520
Not often in and out of love. But...

1266
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:47,698
Can I just say "no" to your kind request,
and leave it at that?

1267
01:44:52,369 --> 01:44:53,412
Yes.

1268
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:58,000
Fine. Of course, I...

1269
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:00,711
Of course.

1270
01:45:03,339 --> 01:45:06,717
Well, I'll just be going then.
It was nice to see you.

1271
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:12,056
The thing is, with you I'm in real danger.

1272
01:45:13,182 --> 01:45:18,229
It seems like a perfect situation,
apart from that foul temper of yours.

1273
01:45:18,521 --> 01:45:22,358
But my relatively inexperienced heart

1274
01:45:22,441 --> 01:45:25,027
would, I fear, not recover

1275
01:45:25,528 --> 01:45:31,367
if I was once again cast aside,
as I would absolutely expect to be.

1276
01:45:32,117 --> 01:45:35,663
There are just too many pictures of you,
too many films.

1277
01:45:36,497 --> 01:45:41,460
You know, you'd go,
and I'd be well-buggered, basically.

1278
01:45:44,129 --> 01:45:47,258
That really is a real "no," isn't it?

1279
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:50,845
I live in Notting Hill.
You live in Beverly Hills.

1280
01:45:51,971 --> 01:45:53,848
Everyone in the world knows who you are.

1281
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:56,767
My mother has trouble
remembering my name.

1282
01:45:58,227 --> 01:45:59,395
Fine.

1283
01:46:01,647 --> 01:46:03,440
Fine. Good decision.

1284
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:06,277
Good decision.

1285
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:12,950
The fame thing isn't really real, you know.

1286
01:46:16,954 --> 01:46:19,206
And don't forget,

1287
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:25,963
I'm also just a girl
standing in front of a boy,

1288
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:30,634
asking him to love her.

1289
01:46:42,605 --> 01:46:43,647
Bye.

1290
01:47:07,004 --> 01:47:09,423
So, what do you think? Good move?

1291
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:11,634
Yeah, good move.

1292
01:47:11,717 --> 01:47:14,720
I mean, when all's said and done,
she's nothing special.

1293
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:16,180
I saw her taking her trousers down

1294
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:19,600
and I definitely glimpsed
some cellulite down there.

1295
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:24,438
Good decision, yeah.
All actresses are as mad as snakes.

1296
01:47:24,521 --> 01:47:25,606
Tones, what do you reckon?

1297
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:27,608
Never met her, never want to.

1298
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:29,401
Brilliant. Max?

1299
01:47:29,485 --> 01:47:31,403
Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.

1300
01:47:31,487 --> 01:47:34,073
Great. Thanks. Brilliant.

1301
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:38,202
I was called and I came. What's up?

1302
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:40,955
William's just turned down Anna Scott.

1303
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:45,042
You daft prick.

1304
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:48,170
No, no. No, no, it's actually quite sensible.

1305
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:54,802
That painting isn't the original, is it?

1306
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,306
You know, I think it might be, yeah.

1307
01:48:00,849 --> 01:48:03,727
But she said
she wanted to go out with you?

1308
01:48:05,854 --> 01:48:07,439
Yeah.

1309
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:09,149
Well, that's nice.

1310
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:11,860
What?

1311
01:48:13,445 --> 01:48:15,656
Well, you know,

1312
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:19,910
anyone saying they wanna go out with you
is pretty great, isn't it?

1313
01:48:25,749 --> 01:48:30,421
It was sort of sweet, actually.

1314
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:36,885
I mean, I know she's an actress and all that,
so she can deliver a line,

1315
01:48:36,969 --> 01:48:42,349
but she said she might be
as famous as she can be

1316
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:46,437
but also that she was just a girl,

1317
01:48:48,856 --> 01:48:51,316
standing in front of a boy,

1318
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:55,612
asking him to love her.

1319
01:49:10,753 --> 01:49:14,214
Oh, sod a dog.
I've made the wrong decision, haven't I?

1320
01:49:18,594 --> 01:49:21,221
Max, how fast is your car?

1321
01:49:24,767 --> 01:49:25,768
Good luck.

1322
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:28,437
If anyone gets in our way,
we have small nuclear devices.

1323
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:30,856
- Where to?
- The Ritz. All I can think is The Ritz.

1324
01:49:30,939 --> 01:49:33,067
- Where's Bella?
- She's not coming.

1325
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:34,902
- Oh, sod that.
- What?

1326
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:36,904
Bernie, sit in the back.

1327
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:40,282
Max, I'm okay.

1328
01:49:43,077 --> 01:49:44,620
Come on, baby.

1329
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:48,791
Mind your back.

1330
01:49:53,045 --> 01:49:54,671
Which way are you going?

1331
01:49:54,755 --> 01:49:55,923
Down Kensington Church Street,

1332
01:49:56,006 --> 01:49:58,217
- then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
- No, no, crazy. Crazy.

1333
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,052
- Go along Bayswater.
- That's right. Then Park Lane.

1334
01:50:00,135 --> 01:50:02,096
No. No. Straight down
to the Cromwell Road, then left.

1335
01:50:02,179 --> 01:50:03,597
No!

1336
01:50:05,516 --> 01:50:08,852
Stop right there!
I will decide the route. All right?

1337
01:50:09,353 --> 01:50:10,729
Sorry, Max.

1338
01:50:12,523 --> 01:50:14,691
James Bond never has to put up
with this sort of shit.

1339
01:50:22,658 --> 01:50:24,785
- Turn right. Turn right!
- I can't, it's one way.

1340
01:50:24,868 --> 01:50:27,246
- Well, do a U-turn.
- Oh, sod it.

1341
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:28,372
Hold on!

1342
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:36,004
- Brilliant!

1343
01:50:44,388 --> 01:50:46,390
Bloody hell, this is fun.

1344
01:50:47,474 --> 01:50:50,394
Hi. Is Miss Scott staying here?

1345
01:50:50,561 --> 01:50:53,480
- No, sir.
- How about Miss Flintstone?

1346
01:50:54,148 --> 01:50:55,274
No, sir.

1347
01:50:55,357 --> 01:50:57,985
- Bambi?
- No, sir.

1348
01:50:58,068 --> 01:51:03,782
Or, I don't know, Beavis or Butt-head?

1349
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:05,576
No, sir.

1350
01:51:07,077 --> 01:51:09,413
Thanks. Thanks.

1351
01:51:10,789 --> 01:51:15,169
There was a Miss Pocahontas,
but she checked out about an hour ago.

1352
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:20,257
I believe she's holding a press conference
at the Savoy, before flying to America.

1353
01:51:25,929 --> 01:51:27,598
We have lift off.

1354
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:38,692
You have message for Takiama?

1355
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,320
I'll just check, sir.

1356
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:06,345
Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.

1357
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:13,435
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1358
01:52:13,518 --> 01:52:15,062
Go. Go.

1359
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:22,653
Hang on. Come on. Wait there!
Come on, come on! Wait!

1360
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:26,198
Go on, go, go, go!

1361
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:29,159
You're my hero!

1362
01:52:31,703 --> 01:52:33,080
Down, boy.

1363
01:52:44,049 --> 01:52:45,050
Go!

1364
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:54,935
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

1365
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:56,311
Where's the press conference, please?

1366
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:58,188
Are you an accredited member of the press?

1367
01:52:58,272 --> 01:52:59,356
Yeah.

1368
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:02,818
There you go.

1369
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:05,612
Yes, that's a Blockbuster Video
membership card, sir.

1370
01:53:05,696 --> 01:53:09,074
That's right.
I work for their in-house magazine.

1371
01:53:09,157 --> 01:53:10,575
<i>Movies Are Our Business.</i>

1372
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:13,120
- I'm sorry, sir.
- He's with me.

1373
01:53:13,203 --> 01:53:14,454
And you are?

1374
01:53:14,538 --> 01:53:18,709
Writing an article on how London hotels
treat people in wheelchairs.

1375
01:53:19,626 --> 01:53:20,794
Yes, of course, madam.

1376
01:53:20,877 --> 01:53:24,965
It's in the Lancaster Room,
though I'm afraid you're rather late.

1377
01:53:25,257 --> 01:53:26,341
Run!

1378
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:46,403
<i>Does this mean that Miss Scott
will not be publicising her next ﬁlm?</i>

1379
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:48,447
No, it absolutely does not mean that.

1380
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:50,991
She'll be abiding
by all her present commitments.

1381
01:53:51,074 --> 01:53:54,661
She just won't be making any more
for the next year.

1382
01:53:54,745 --> 01:53:56,997
<i>When will the ﬁlm be released?</i>

1383
01:53:57,122 --> 01:54:00,834
At the moment, the plan is to release
in America towards the end of the autumn,

1384
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:04,671
and over here, around Christmas,
or early in the New Year.

1385
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:07,215
Right! Dominic.

1386
01:54:07,424 --> 01:54:10,469
Anna, how much longer are you staying
in the UK then?

1387
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:12,262
No time at all. I leave tonight.

1388
01:54:12,346 --> 01:54:16,767
Which is why we have to round things up
now, so final questions, please.

1389
01:54:17,434 --> 01:54:19,102
Yes, lady there.

1390
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:23,815
Is your decision to take a year off
anything to do with the rumours about Jeff

1391
01:54:23,899 --> 01:54:25,525
and his present leading lady?

1392
01:54:25,609 --> 01:54:27,069
Absolutely not.

1393
01:54:27,152 --> 01:54:28,820
Do you believe the rumours?

1394
01:54:28,904 --> 01:54:32,074
Well, it's really not my business any more.

1395
01:54:32,157 --> 01:54:37,996
Though, I will say, from my experience,
rumours about Jeff do tend to be true.

1396
01:54:40,582 --> 01:54:41,666
Yeah.

1397
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:44,795
The last time you were here,
there were some fairly graphic photographs

1398
01:54:44,878 --> 01:54:48,465
taken of you with a young English guy.

1399
01:54:49,132 --> 01:54:51,343
So, what happened there?

1400
01:54:51,718 --> 01:54:54,971
He was just a friend.
We're still friends, I think.

1401
01:54:56,807 --> 01:55:01,061
Right. Yes, gentleman in the pink shirt.

1402
01:55:06,608 --> 01:55:07,651
Yes.

1403
01:55:09,069 --> 01:55:13,615
Miss Scott,
are there any circumstances in which

1404
01:55:13,698 --> 01:55:18,870
the two of you might be
more than just good friends?

1405
01:55:21,581 --> 01:55:26,586
I hoped there would be,
but no, I'm assured there aren't.

1406
01:55:26,711 --> 01:55:29,714
- But what would you say if...
- I'm sorry, just the one question, please.

1407
01:55:29,798 --> 01:55:32,342
No, it's all right. You were saying?

1408
01:55:34,386 --> 01:55:40,100
I was just wondering if it turned out
that this person...

1409
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:43,603
Thacker. His name's Thacker.

1410
01:55:43,687 --> 01:55:45,230
Thanks. Thanks.

1411
01:55:45,564 --> 01:55:49,651
I just wondered whether
if Mr. Thacker realised

1412
01:55:49,734 --> 01:55:52,237
he'd been a daft prick

1413
01:55:54,448 --> 01:55:58,285
and got down on his knees
and begged you to reconsider,

1414
01:55:58,368 --> 01:56:03,415
whether you would,
in fact, then reconsider?

1415
01:56:13,675 --> 01:56:15,552
Yes, I believe I would.

1416
01:56:18,889 --> 01:56:20,765
That's very good news.

1417
01:56:23,727 --> 01:56:27,439
<i>The readers of Horse & Hound
will be absolutely delighted.</i>

1418
01:56:33,904 --> 01:56:37,491
Right, Dominic, if you'd like to ask
your question again?

1419
01:56:37,574 --> 01:56:38,575
Yeah.

1420
01:56:39,034 --> 01:56:42,579
Anna, how long are you intending
to stay here in Britain?

1421
01:56:50,378 --> 01:56:51,880
Indefinitely.

1422
01:57:16,279 --> 01:57:19,282
- What happened?
- It was good.

1423
01:57:40,804 --> 01:57:42,847
Are you gonna get married?
