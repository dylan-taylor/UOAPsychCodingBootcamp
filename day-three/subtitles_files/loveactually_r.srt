1
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,599
<i>Whenever I get gloomy
with the state of the world,</i>

2
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:43,144
<i>I think about
the arrivals gate
at Heathrow airport.</i>

3
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,687
<i>General opinion
started to make out</i>

4
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,190
<i>that we live
in a world of
hatred and greed,</i>

5
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,775
<i>but I don't see that.</i>

6
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,277
<i>Seems to me that
love is everywhere.</i>

7
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,531
<i>Often
it's not particularly
dignified or newsworthy,</i>

8
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,366
<i>but it's always there.</i>

9
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,034
<i>Fathers and sons,
mothers and daughters,</i>

10
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,327
<i>husbands and wives,</i>

11
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,163
<i>boyfriends, girlfriends,
old friends.</i>

12
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,666
<i>When the planes
hit the Twin Towers,</i>

13
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,210
<i>as far as I know,
none of the phone calls
from the people on board</i>

14
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,921
<i>were messages of
hate or revenge.</i>

15
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,215
<i>They were all
messages of love.</i>

16
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,843
<i>If you look for it,
I've got a sneaky feeling</i>

17
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,513
<i>you'll find that love
actually is all around.</i>

18
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,156
<i>I feel it in my fingers</i>

19
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,493
<i>I feel it in my toes</i>

20
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:45,331
<i>Feel it in my toes, yeah</i>

21
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,836
<i>Love is all around me
And so the...</i>

22
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,213
<i>I'm afraid you
did it again, Bill.</i>

23
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,801
It's just, I know the old
version so well, you know.

24
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,345
<i>Well, we all do.</i>

25
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,973
<i>That's why
we're making
the new version.</i>

26
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,600
Right, okay, let's go.

27
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,355
<i>I feel it in my fingers</i>

28
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,481
<i>In my fingers</i>

29
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,568
<i>I feel it in my toes</i>

30
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:18,072
<i>Feel it in my toes, yeah</i>

31
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,241
<i>Love is all...</i>

32
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:24,037
Fuck, wank, bugger,
shitting ass head
and hole.

33
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,916
Start again.

34
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,257
<i>I feel it in my fingers</i>

35
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,383
<i>In my fingers</i>

36
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,386
<i>I feel it in my toes</i>

37
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,141
<i>Feel it in my toes, yeah</i>

38
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:47,393
<i>Christmas is all around me</i>

39
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,519
<i>All around me</i>

40
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,773
<i>And so the feeling grows</i>

41
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:56,152
<i>So the feeling grows</i>

42
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,821
<i>It's written in the wind</i>

43
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,156
<i>In the wind</i>

44
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,742
<i>It's everywhere I go</i>

45
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:07,580
<i>Everywhere I go</i>

46
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,083
<i>So if you
really love Christmas</i>

47
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,209
<i>Love Christmas</i>

48
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,753
<i>Come on and let it snow</i>

49
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,005
<i>Come on and let it...</i>

50
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,257
This is shit, isn't it?

51
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,135
<i>Yep,
solid gold shit, maestro.</i>

52
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,995
God, I'm so late.

53
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,414
It's just round the corner.
You'll make it.

54
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,291
You sure
you don't mind me
going without you?

55
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,752
No, really.
I'm just feeling so rotten.

56
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,254
I love you.

57
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,505
I know.

58
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:01,426
I love you
even when you're
sick and look disgusting.

59
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,304
I know.
Now, go or you
will actually miss it.

60
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,140
Right.

61
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,519
Did I mention that I love you?

62
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,439
Yes, you did.
Get out, loser.

63
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,459
Karen, it's me again.

64
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,713
I'm sorry,
I literally don't have
anyone else to talk to.

65
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:43,384
Absolutely.
Horrible moment right now,
though. Can I call you back?

66
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,802
Of course.

67
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,639
Doesn't mean I'm
not terribly concerned
that your wife just died.

68
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,892
Understood.

69
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,311
Bugger off, call me later.

70
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,067
So what's this
big news then?

71
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,568
We've been
given our parts
in the nativity play...

72
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,613
...and I'm the lobster.

73
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,281
The lobster?
Yeah.

74
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,949
In the nativity play?

75
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,785
Yeah. First lobster.

76
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,622
There was more than one
lobster present at the
birth of Jesus?

77
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,706
Duh.

78
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,506
Best sandwiches in Britain.

79
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,009
Try my lovely nuts?

80
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,806
Beautiful muffin
for a beautiful lady.

81
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,561
Morning, my future wife.

82
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,915
Okay, you can
stop there. Thanks.

83
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,876
I'm gonna need a couple
of orange gels, please,
mate.

84
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,670
And by the way,
he introduced
me as John,

85
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,130
but actually
everyone calls me Jack.

86
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,133
Fine. Nice to meet you, Jack.

87
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,802
He got me right, though.
I'm just Judy.

88
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,637
Great, Just Judy!

89
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,562
No surprises?
No surprises.

90
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,564
Not like the stag night?

91
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,440
Unlike the stag night.

92
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,526
Do you admit the Brazilian
prostitutes were a mistake?

93
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,027
I do.

94
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,656
And it would've been
much better if they'd
not turned out to be men?

95
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,741
That is true.

96
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,288
Good luck, kiddo.

97
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,105
Prime Minister!

98
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,452
Thank you.

99
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,496
Welcome, Prime Minister.

100
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,249
I must work
on my wave.

101
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,792
How are you?

102
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,879
How are you feeling?

103
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,089
Cool. Powerful.

104
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,884
Would you like to meet
your household staff?

105
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,553
Yes, I would like
that very much indeed.

106
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,640
Anything to put off
actually running the country.

107
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,477
This
is Terence.
He's in charge.

108
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,187
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.

109
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,147
I had an uncle
called Terence once.

110
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,690
Hated him.
I think he was a pervert.

111
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,318
But I very much
like the look of you.

112
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,654
This is Pat.
Hello, Pat.

113
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,281
Good morning, sir.
I'm the housekeeper.

114
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,825
Right. It should be
a lot easier with me
than with the last lot.

115
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,787
No nappies, no teenagers,
no scary wife.

116
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,790
And this is Natalie.
She's new, like you.

117
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,875
Hello, Natalie.
Hello, David.

118
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,627
I mean, sir.

119
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,837
Shit,
I can't believe
I've just said that.

120
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,716
And now I've
gone and said "shit."
Twice. I'm so sorry, sir.

121
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,010
It's fine, it's fine.
You could've said "fuck"

122
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,429
and then we'd have
been in real trouble.
Thank you, sir.

123
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:19,100
I did have an awful
premonition I was gonna
fuck up on my first day.

124
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,185
Oh, piss it!

125
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:27,275
Right, I'll go get my things
and then let's fix the
country, shall we?

126
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,735
Yeah,
I can't see why not.

127
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,251
It's all right.
Did you see what I did?

128
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,961
Yes, I did.
I just went...

129
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:48,629
Hello, there.

130
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,714
I'm right over here.

131
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,758
Yeah, I'm in here.
Okay. Good. Thank you.

132
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,936
Oh, no.
That is so inconvenient.

133
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,860
In the presence of God,
Peter and Juliet have
given their consent

134
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,487
and made
their marriage
vows to each other.

135
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,866
They've declared their
marriage by the giving
and receiving of rings.

136
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,870
I therefore proclaim that
they are husband and wife.

137
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,545
And you resisted the
temptation for surprises.

138
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,714
Yeah, I'm mature now.

139
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,894
<i>Love, love, love</i>

140
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,607
<i>Love, love, love</i>

141
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,069
Did you do this?

142
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,946
No.

143
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,743
<i>Love, love, love, love</i>

144
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,915
<i>There's nothing you can do
that can't be done</i>

145
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,083
It...

146
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,211
<i>There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung</i>

147
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,758
<i>There's nothing you can say
but you can learn how to
play the game</i>

148
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,220
<i>It's easy</i>

149
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,932
<i>All you need is love</i>

150
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,104
<i>All you need is love</i>

151
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,402
<i>All you need is love, love</i>

152
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,613
<i>Love is all you need...</i>

153
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,410
Look, it's Pikey.

154
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,173
Hello!
What the hell
are you doing here?

155
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,385
I just popped over
to borrow some old CDs.

156
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,886
The lady
of the house let
you in, did she?

157
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,179
Yeah.

158
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,265
Lovely, obliging girl.

159
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,474
Yeah.

160
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,934
All right,
I just thought I'd pop back

161
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,602
before the reception
and see if she's better.

162
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,940
This is good.
Listen, I've been thinking.

163
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,401
I think perhaps
we ought to take

164
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,820
Mum out for her
birthday on Friday.
What do you think?

165
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,822
I just
feel we've been
bad sons this year.

166
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,741
Okay, sounds fine.
A bit boring but fine.

167
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,285
Hurry up, big boy!

168
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:28,122
I'm naked, and I
want you at least twice
before Jamie gets home.

169
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,469
I am so
happy to see you!

170
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,263
A delicious delicacy?

171
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,723
No, thanks.

172
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,606
Taste explosion?

173
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,912
Food?
No, thanks.

174
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,749
Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it?
Looks like a dead baby's
finger.

175
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,086
Tastes like it, too.

176
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,884
I'm Colin, by the way.

177
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,428
I'm Nancy.
Wicked.

178
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,972
What do you do, Nancy?
I'm a cook.

179
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,891
Ever do weddings?
Yes, I do.

180
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,851
They
should've asked
you to do this one.

181
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,186
They did.

182
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,523
God,
I wish you hadn't
have turned it down.

183
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,732
I didn't.

184
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,984
Right.

185
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,697
I've just worked out
why I can never find
true love.

186
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,823
Why is that?

187
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,243
English girls.
They're stuck
up, you see.

188
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,495
And I am primarily
attractive to girls

189
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,956
who are, you know,
cooler, game for a laugh.

190
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,293
Like American girls.
So I should just go
to America.

191
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,796
I would get
a girlfriend
there instantly.

192
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,880
What do you think?

193
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,924
I think it's crap, Colin.

194
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,884
That's where you're wrong.

195
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,096
American girls
would seriously dig me
with my cute British accent.

196
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,722
You don't have a cute
British accent.

197
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,975
Yes, I do!
I'm going to America.

198
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,853
Colin, you're a lonely,
ugly asshole, and you
must accept it.

199
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,898
Never.
I am Colin,
God of Sex.

200
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,984
I'm just on the wrong
continent, that's all.

201
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,112
Bit of quiet while we
finish the lighting, guys!

202
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,781
I thought I was never
gonna make it here today.

203
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,575
The traffic was just...
Unbelievable.

204
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,868
Judy, could you take
the top off this time?

205
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,829
Lighting and camera need to
know when we're actually
gonna

206
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,248
see the nipples
and when we're not.

207
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,085
Yes, okay.
Right. At least it's
nice and warm in here.

208
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,129
Yeah.
It's not always
the case, is it?

209
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,965
I was standing
in for Brad Pitt once
on <i>Seven Years in Tibet...</i>

210
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,551
Yes, yeah.
Bloody freezing.

211
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,554
Sorry, guys, time's pretty
tight and we have to get
the actors in.

212
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,848
Fine.
I promise I won't look.

213
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,562
Right,
let's have another
look at that one, please.

214
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,118
And Jerry says
if you can just put
your hands on her breasts.

215
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,328
All right, okay, yeah.
Is that all right?

216
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,746
Yes. Yeah, fine.

217
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,581
I'll warm them up.

218
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,002
And massage them, please.

219
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,170
Right.

220
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,969
It's
junction 13 that's
just murder, isn't it?

221
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,430
Total gridlock this morning.

222
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:40,356
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

223
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,567
Some of
her requests,
for instance,

224
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:49,031
that I should
bring Claudia Schiffer
as my date to the funeral,

225
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,701
I was confident
she expected me
to ignore.

226
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,121
But others she was
pretty damn clear
about.

227
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,376
When she
first mentioned
what's about to happen,

228
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,129
I said,
"Over my dead body."

229
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,341
And she said,
"No, Daniel, over mine."

230
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,636
And as usual,
my darling girl

231
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,556
and Sam's
darling mom was right.

232
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:21,105
So she's going to
say her final farewell
to you not through me but,

233
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:25,943
inevitably, ever so coolly,

234
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:31,281
through the
immortal genius of
the Bay City Rollers.

235
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,300
Do you love him?

236
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,428
What?

237
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,015
No, I just thought I'd ask
the blunt question in case
it was the right one

238
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,683
and you
needed someone
to talk to about it

239
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,809
and no one had
ever asked you,

240
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,353
so you've never been able to
talk about it though you
might've wanted to.

241
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:47,733
No. No.
No is the answer.
No. Absolutely not.

242
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,154
So that's a no, then?

243
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,447
Yes.

244
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,914
This DJ,
what do you reckon?

245
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,958
The worst in history?
Probably.

246
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,377
I think
it all hangs
on the next song.

247
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,254
<i>Now here's one
for the lovers.</i>

248
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,841
<i>That's quite a few of you,
I shouldn't be surprised
and a half.</i>

249
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,268
He's done it, it's official.
Worst DJ in the world.

250
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,571
Sarah's waiting for you.

251
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,200
Yes, of course.

252
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,078
Great, good, good.

253
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,205
How are you doing, Mia?

254
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,332
Are you
settling in fine?
Learning who to avoid?

255
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,125
Absolutely.

256
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,879
Harry?

257
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:55,342
Sarah, switch off your
phone and tell me exactly

258
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,470
how long it is that
you've been working here.

259
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,059
Two years, seven months,

260
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,854
three days and, I suppose,
what, two hours?

261
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:11,775
And how long have
you been in love with Karl,
our enigmatic chief designer?

262
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,325
Two years,
seven months, three days

263
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,203
and, I suppose,
an hour and 30
minutes.

264
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,788
Thought as much.

265
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,999
Do you think everybody knows?
Yes.

266
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,167
Do you think Karl knows?
Yes.

267
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,505
That is...
That is bad news.

268
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,175
I just thought that
maybe the time had
come

269
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,886
to do something about it.

270
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,346
Like what?

271
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,682
Invite him out for a drink,
and then after about 20
minutes,

272
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,268
casually drop into
the conversation the fact
that you'd like to marry him

273
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,394
and have lots of sex
and babies.

274
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,771
You know that?
Yes.

275
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,399
And so does Karl.

276
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,485
Think about it,
for all our sakes.

277
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,113
It's Christmas.

278
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:04,536
Certainly. Excellent.
Will do. Thanks, boss.

279
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,582
Hi, Sarah.
Hi, Karl.

280
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,791
Excuse me.

281
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,388
Babe.
Absolutely, fire away.

282
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,934
Mia, Mia, would
you turn that down?

283
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,187
What is that?

284
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,191
And that was
the Christmas effort by
the once great Billy Mack.

285
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,152
Oh, dear me, how
are the mighty fallen.

286
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,654
I can safely put my
hand up my ass and
say

287
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,449
that is the worst record
I've heard this century...

288
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,120
And, coincidentally,
I believe Billy will
be a guest

289
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,831
<i>on my friend
Mike's show in
a few minutes' time.</i>

290
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,709
Welcome back, Bill.

291
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,337
So, Billy,
welcome back
to the airwaves.

292
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,590
New Christmas single,
cover of <i>Love Is All Around.</i>

293
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:03,804
Except we've changed the
word "love" to "Christmas."

294
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,224
Yes,
is that an important
message to you, Bill?

295
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,518
Not really, Mike.

296
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:14,147
Christmas is a time for people
with someone they love in
their lives.

297
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,566
And that's not you?
That's not me, Michael.

298
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,654
When I was
young and successful,
I was greedy and foolish,

299
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:24,700
and now I'm
left with no one,
wrinkled and alone.

300
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,744
Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.
For what?

301
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,539
Well, for actually giving
a real answer to a question.

302
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,292
It doesn't often happen here
at Radio Watford, I can tell
you.

303
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,503
Ask me anything you like,
and I'll tell you the truth.

304
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,338
Best shag you ever had?

305
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,423
Britney Spears.

306
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,507
Wow.

307
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,135
No, only kidding!

308
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,678
She was rubbish.

309
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,138
Okay, here's one.

310
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:50,600
How do you think the new
record compares to your
old, classic stuff?

311
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,271
Come on, Mikey,
you know as well as
I do the record's crap.

312
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,317
But wouldn't it be great
if number one this Christmas

313
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,653
wasn't some
smug teenager

314
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:06,074
but an old ex-heroin addict
searching for a comeback
at any price?

315
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,493
All those
young popsters
come Christmas day,

316
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:12,414
they'll be stretched out naked
with a cute bird balancing on
their balls

317
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:16,084
and I'll be stuck
in some dingy flat
with me manager, Joe,

318
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,170
ugliest man in the world,

319
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,549
fucking miserable
because our fucking
gamble didn't pay off.

320
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:27,679
So if you believe in
Father Christmas, children,
like your Uncle Billy does,

321
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,850
buy my festering
turd of a record.

322
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,145
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness

323
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:39,357
of the moment when
we try to squeeze an extra
syllable into the fourth line.

324
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,777
I think you're referring to,

325
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,488
"If you really
love Christmas..."

326
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,448
"Come on and let it snow."

327
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,659
So, here it is one more time,

328
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:53,163
the dark horse
for this year's
Christmas number one,

329
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,083
<i>Christmas Is All Around.</i>
Thank you, Billy.

330
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,626
After this, the news.

331
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,420
Is the
new prime minister
in trouble already?

332
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,844
Okay. What's next?

333
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,179
The President's visit.

334
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,766
Yes, yes.
I fear this is going to
be a difficult one to play.

335
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,975
Alex.

336
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,770
There's a very
strong feeling
in the party

337
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,647
we mustn't allow
ourselves to be
bullied

338
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,023
from pillar to post
like the last government.

339
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,191
Hear, hear.

340
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,568
This is our first
really important test.

341
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,320
Let's take a stand.

342
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:30,283
Right. Right.
I understand that,
but I have decided

343
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,537
not to. Not this time.

344
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,539
We will, of course,
try to be clever.

345
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,375
But let's not forget
that America is the most
powerful country in the world.

346
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,836
I'm not going to act
like a petulant child.

347
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,548
Right,
who do you have
to screw around here

348
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,800
to get a cup of tea
and a chocolate biscuit?

349
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,975
Right.

350
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,687
Yeah, come in.

351
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,655
These have just come through
from the treasury and these
are for you.

352
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,491
Excellent.
Thanks a lot.

353
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,869
I was hoping you'd win,

354
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,537
not that I wouldn't have been
nice to the other bloke, too.

355
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,456
Just always given him
the boring biscuits
with no chocolate.

356
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,585
Thanks very much. Thanks...

357
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,255
Natalie.

358
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:34,598
God, come on, get a grip.
You're the prime minister,
for God's sake.

359
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,394
So what do you reckon to
our new prime minister then?

360
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:43,607
I like him.
I can't understand why
he's not married, though.

361
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,985
You know the type,
he's married to his job.

362
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,197
Either that or gay
as a picnic basket.

363
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,742
Excuse me, Judy,
if you could just
lower the nipples

364
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,826
and cheat them
a bit to the left?

365
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,036
Okay.

366
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,250
I have to say, Judy,
this is a real pleasure.

367
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,837
It's lovely
to find someone
I can actually chat to.

368
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,089
Thank you.
Well, you know...

369
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,758
And ditto.
Thank you.

370
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,927
And the move again,
please, Judy.

371
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,553
Sorry.
God, sorry.

372
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,764
Are you all right?
Yeah, fine.

373
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,726
Exciting news!

374
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,852
What?

375
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,522
I've bought
a ticket to the States.
I'm off in three weeks.

376
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,815
No.
Yes!

377
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,902
To a fantastic
place called Wisconsin.

378
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,028
No!

379
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,615
Yes! Wisconsin babes,
here comes Sir Colin!

380
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:38,411
No, Col!
There are a few babes
in America, I grant you,

381
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,122
but they're
already going out
with rich, attractive guys.

382
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,084
Tone,
you're just jealous.

383
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:48,129
You know perfectly well
that any bar anywhere
in America

384
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:52,717
contains 10 girls
more beautiful and more
likely to have sex with me

385
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,135
than the whole of
the United Kingdom.

386
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,222
That is total bollocks.
You've actually gone
mad now.

387
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:02,352
No, I'm wise. Stateside I am
Prince William without the
weird family.

388
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,979
No, Colin, no!

389
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,814
Yes!

390
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,607
Ja, darling!

391
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,944
Right, the Christmas party,
not my favorite night of
the year

392
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,613
and your unhappy
job to organize.

393
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,864
Tell me.

394
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,658
It's basic, really.

395
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,704
Find a venue, over-order on
the drinks, bulk buy the
guacamole

396
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:24,708
and advise the girls to avoid
Kevin if they want their
breasts unfondled.

397
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,918
Wives and family and stuff?

398
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,087
Yeah.
I mean, not children.

399
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,799
But their wives and
girlfriends, et cetera.

400
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,760
Oh, Christ, you haven't
got some horrible six-foot,

401
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,638
tight-T-shirt-wearing
boyfriend you'll
be bringing, have you?

402
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:43,310
No. I'll just be hanging
around the mistletoe,
hoping to be kissed.

403
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:45,979
Really?

404
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,648
Right.

405
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,244
He now spends all
the time in his room.

406
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,662
I mean,
he'll be up there now.

407
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:06,082
That's nothing unusual
about that. My horrid
son...

408
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,334
Bernard?
Bernard.

409
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:11,171
Stays in his room all
the time. Thank goodness.

410
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,757
Yeah, but, Karen,
this is all the time.

411
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,887
I'm afraid that
there's something
really wrong, you know?

412
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,348
I mean,
clearly it's
about his mom,

413
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:26,561
but, Christ, he might
be injecting heroin into
his eyeballs for all I know.

414
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,772
At the age of 11?

415
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,232
Well, maybe
not his eyeballs, then.

416
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,276
Maybe just his veins.

417
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,278
You see,
the problem is
it was his mom

418
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,989
who always
used to talk to
him, you know, and...

419
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,660
I don't know, this
whole stepfather thing

420
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:46,748
seems suddenly
to somehow matter
like it never did before.

421
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:51,669
Listen,
it was always going to
be a totally shit time.

422
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,296
Just be patient.

423
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,800
And maybe check
the room for needles.

424
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,511
And then when he
sometimes does come out,

425
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,721
it's obvious
he's been crying.

426
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,526
It's just such
a ridiculous waste.

427
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,904
And now if
it's going to ruin
Sam's life as well...

428
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,865
I just don't know.

429
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:26,704
Get a grip.
People hate sissies.

430
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,958
No one's
ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time.

431
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,378
Yeah. Absolutely.

432
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,547
Helpful.

433
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:47,350
So, what's the
problem, Samuel?

434
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:53,523
Is it just Mom or
is it something else?

435
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,402
Maybe school?

436
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,321
Are you being bullied?

437
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,033
Or is it something worse?

438
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,121
Can you give me
any clues at all?

439
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,749
You really want to know?

440
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,084
I really want to know.

441
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,712
Even though you won't be
able to do anything to help?

442
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,089
Even if that's the case,
yeah.

443
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,635
Okay. Well...

444
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,306
Truth is, actually,

445
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,850
I'm in love.

446
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,060
Sorry?

447
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,022
I know I should
be thinking about Mom
all the time and I am,

448
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,732
but the truth is I'm in love.

449
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,359
I was before she died,
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

450
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,281
Aren't you a bit
young to be in love?

451
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,407
No.

452
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,202
Well, okay, well...

453
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,623
I mean,
I'm a little relieved.

454
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,709
Why?
Because I

455
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,003
thought it would
be something worse.

456
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,215
Worse than the total
agony of being in love?

457
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,804
No, you're right.
Total agony.

458
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,094
Night, Sarah.

459
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,387
Night, Karl.

460
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,065
Yeah, absolutely.

461
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,235
Free as a bird. Fire away.

462
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,060
Alone again.

463
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,646
Naturally.

464
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,690
I'll deal with it.

465
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,941
All right.

466
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,486
Natalie.
Sir.

467
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,034
Thanks. Natalie.

468
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,831
I'm starting to feel

469
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,961
uncomfortable
about us working in such
close proximity every day

470
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,379
and me knowing so
little about you.

471
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,674
It seems...
It seems elitist and wrong.

472
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,093
Well,
there's not
much to know.

473
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,680
Well, where do you live,
for instance?

474
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,058
Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

475
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:18,811
My sister lives in Wandsworth.
Yeah.

476
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:22,148
So which exactly
is the dodgy end?

477
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,983
Right at the end
of the High Street,

478
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,319
Harris Street,
near the Queen's Head.

479
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,446
Yeah, yeah, that is dodgy.

480
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:33,368
And
you live with your
husband? Boyfriend?

481
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,245
Three illegitimate
but charming children?

482
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,372
No.

483
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,040
I've just split up with
my boyfriend, actually,

484
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,918
so I'm back with my
mom and dad for a while.

485
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,004
Sorry.

486
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,673
No, it's fine.

487
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,677
I'm well shot of him.
He said I was getting fat.

488
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,928
I beg your pardon?

489
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:56,015
He said no one's gonna fancy
a girl with thighs the size
of big tree trunks.

490
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,601
Not a nice guy, actually,
in the end.

491
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,188
No.

492
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,489
You know,

493
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,118
being prime minister,
I could just have
him murdered.

494
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,746
Thank you, sir.
I'll think about it.

495
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,917
Do. The SAS are
absolutely charming.

496
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,838
Ruthless, trained killers
are just a phone call away.

497
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,595
Oh, God.

498
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,392
Did you have this kind
of problem?

499
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,230
Yeah, course you did,
you saucy minx.

500
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:48,025
So, let's go.
We can definitely crack this.

501
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,570
Remember,
I was a kid once, too.

502
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:55,158
So, come on, it's
someone at school.
Right?

503
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,868
Yeah.
Good, good.

504
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,246
And what does she,
he, feel about you?

505
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,124
She doesn't even know my name.

506
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,793
And even if she did,
she'd despise me.

507
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,212
She's the coolest girl
in school,

508
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,299
and everyone worships
her because she's heaven.

509
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,261
Good. Good.

510
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:21,392
Well, basically
you're fucked, aren't you?

511
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,067
Hi there, and welcome back.

512
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,195
So, Billy, three weeks
till Christmas,

513
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,530
looks like the real
competition is gonna be Blue.

514
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,158
Yeah,
I saw them on
the show last week.

515
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,993
They weren't very nice
about my record.

516
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:40,536
No. Little scamps.

517
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,041
But very, very
talented musicians.

518
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:49,170
Yeah. Billy, I understand
you've got a prize
for our competition winners.

519
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:54,801
Yes, I have, Ant or Dec.
It's a personalized
felt-tip pen.

520
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,469
Great.

521
00:34:56,552 --> 00:35:00,389
It's brilliant.
It even writes
on glass,

522
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,850
so if you've got
a framed picture,

523
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,228
like,
for instance,
this one of Blue,

524
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,313
you can just write on it.

525
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,579
A lot of kids
watching, Billy.

526
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,872
Yeah.

527
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,084
Hiya, kids.

528
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,254
Here's an
important message
from your Uncle Bill.

529
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,548
Don't buy drugs.

530
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,594
Become a pop star
and they give you
them for free.

531
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,347
And I do believe
it's a commercial break.

532
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,724
Thank goodness. We'll
see you soon. Bye-bye.

533
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,030
Look at him!

534
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,991
Just a minute.

535
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,535
Actually,
they're not
funny. They're art.

536
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,542
Okay, let's say
Thursday, my place.

537
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,169
Great. But for now
I've got Juliet on
the other line.

538
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,547
Can I patch you through?
She wants to ask you a favor.

539
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,215
Okay, fine.

540
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,218
Thanks and be nice.

541
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,845
I'm always nice.

542
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:24,307
<i>You know what I mean,
Marky, be friendly.</i>

543
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,475
<i>- I'm always...</i>
- Mark?

544
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,770
Hi. How was the honeymoon?

545
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,899
It was great. And thanks
for the gorgeous sendoff.

546
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,358
So, what can I do for you?

547
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,110
<i>It's only a tiny favor.</i>

548
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:39,280
I've just
tried the wedding video,
and it's a complete disaster.

549
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,240
<i>It's come out
all blue and wibbly.</i>

550
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,325
I'm sorry.

551
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,493
I remember you
filming a lot in the day

552
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,329
and I just wondered if I
could look at your stuff.

553
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,331
No, look,
to be honest,
I didn't really...

554
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,667
Please. All I want
is just one shot of
me in a wedding dress

555
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,544
that isn't bright turquoise.

556
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,464
Okay, I'll have
a look, but to be honest,
I'm pretty sure I wiped it,

557
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,299
so don't get any hopes up.

558
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,717
<i>Must go.</i>

559
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,434
Any progress with
our matchmaking plans?

560
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:12,563
No. I've done fuck-all
and never will because
he's too good for me.

561
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,649
How true.

562
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,152
Stop.

563
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,404
And, of course,
your mobile goes.

564
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,367
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

565
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,161
So, how's the
Christmas party going?

566
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:28,329
Good.

567
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,456
Think I've found a venue.
Friend of mine works there.

568
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,458
What's it like?

569
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,793
Good. Good.

570
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:39,090
It's an art gallery.
Full of dark corners
for doing dark deeds.

571
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,719
Right.

572
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,223
Good. Well,
I suppose I should

573
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,225
take a look at
it or something.

574
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,519
You should.

575
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:16,377
Welcome back. And this year
you bring a lady guest?

576
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,547
No. There's a change
of situation. Just me.

577
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,216
Am I sad or not sad?

578
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,926
I think you're not surprised.

579
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,845
And
you stay here
till Christmas?

580
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:26,971
Yeah, yeah.

581
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:32,059
Good. Well, I find you
a perfect lady to
clean the house.

582
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,729
This is Aurelia.

583
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:51,287
Unfortunately, she cannot
speak French, just like you.

584
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,539
She's Portuguese.

585
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,592
I think
she's 10 years
too young to remember

586
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,927
there was a footballer
called Eusebio.

587
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,305
And <i>"molto bueno"</i> is Spanish.

588
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,931
Right. Right.

589
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,768
Anyway, it's nice
to meet you and...

590
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,520
Perhaps
you can drive her home
at the end of her work?

591
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,646
Absolutely, yes.

592
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,568
Which is what? Turkish?

593
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,510
No, right.
Silence is golden.

594
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,555
As the Tremeloes said.

595
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,477
Clever guys,
although I think
the original version

596
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,523
was by
Frankie Valli
& the Four Seasons.

597
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,650
Great band.

598
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,529
Shut up.

599
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,042
Mr. President!

600
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,628
Over here, sir!

601
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,630
What will you
be talking about?

602
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,592
Mr. President, welcome.

603
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,969
It's a pleasure to meet you.

604
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,345
Come on through.

605
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:32,680
I'm sorry
your wife couldn't
make it, by the way.

606
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,267
So is she.
Although she would have
been kind of lonely, I'm sure.

607
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:40,771
Yes. Pathetic, isn't it?
Just never been able to
tie a girl down.

608
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,524
Not sure
that politics and
dating really go together.

609
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,694
Really?
I've never found that.

610
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,529
Yeah, well, the difference is
you're still sickeningly
handsome,

611
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,532
whereas
I look increasingly
like my Aunt Mildred.

612
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,409
Very jealous of your plane,
by the way.

613
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,245
Thank you. We love that
thing, I'll tell you.

614
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,205
Natalie. Hi.

615
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,708
Morning, ma'am.
How's your day
so far?

616
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,003
Excellent.

617
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,134
My goodness,
that's a pretty little
son of a bitch, right there.

618
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,178
Did you see those pipes?

619
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,764
Yeah, yeah,
she's terrific at her job.

620
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:20,519
No, absolutely not.
We cannot and will not
consult on that, either.

621
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,396
That is unexpected.

622
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,732
Well, it shouldn't be.

623
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,860
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

624
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,571
We're just
being consistent
with their policies.

625
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,490
Well,
with all respect, sir,
they were bad policies.

626
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,451
All right, thanks, Alex.

627
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:41,165
I don't think we're
making progress here.
Let's move on, shall we?

628
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:47,129
Well, now, that was
an interesting day.

629
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,549
Sorry if our line was firm,

630
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,635
but there's no point in
tiptoeing around today,

631
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,346
then just disappointing you
for four years.

632
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,724
I mean, I have plans
and I plan to see
them through.

633
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,727
Absolutely. Now, there is
one final thing I think
we should look at.

634
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,647
It's very
close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

635
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,441
I'll give you anything
you ask for.

636
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,778
As long as
it's not something
I don't wanna give.

637
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,451
Hi.

638
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:19,536
Pathetic.

639
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,892
It's great Scotch.

640
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,647
I'll...
I'll be going, then.

641
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,901
Natalie,

642
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,446
I hope to see
much more of you as
our two great countries

643
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,282
work toward
a better future.

644
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,200
Thank you, sir.

645
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:17,261
Yes, Peter.

646
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,805
Mr. President,
has it been a good visit?

647
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,850
Very satisfactory indeed.

648
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,227
We got what we came for,

649
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,981
and our
special relationship
is still very special.

650
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,483
And, Prime Minister?

651
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,819
I love that word
"relationship."

652
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,238
Covers all manner of sins,
doesn't it?

653
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:40,242
I fear that
this has become
a bad relationship,

654
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:45,247
a relationship
based on the President
taking exactly what he wants

655
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:50,419
and casually ignoring all
those things that really
matter to

656
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,341
Britain.

657
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:59,386
We may be a small country,
but we're a great one, too.

658
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,848
The country
of Shakespeare,
Churchill, The Beatles,

659
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,808
Sean Connery, Harry Potter.

660
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:11,732
David Beckham's right foot.
David Beckham's left foot,
come to that.

661
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:15,903
And a friend who bullies
us is no longer a friend.

662
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,281
And since
bullies only respond to
strength, from now onward,

663
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,951
I will be prepared
to be much stronger.

664
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,120
And the President
should be prepared for that.

665
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,300
Mr. President!

666
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:43,972
Joe.

667
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,975
It's your sister on line four.

668
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,686
All right.

669
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,856
Yes, I'm very
busy and important.
How can I help you?

670
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,983
Have you gone
completely insane?

671
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,860
You can't be sensible
all the time.

672
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,654
<i>You can
if you're
prime minister.</i>

673
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,948
Oh, dear,
it's the Chancellor of the
Exchequer on the other line.

674
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,032
<i>No, it isn't!</i>
I'll call you back.

675
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,450
No, you won't!

676
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,414
The trouble with being
the prime minister's
sister is

677
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,625
it does
put your life into
rather harsh perspective.

678
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,629
What did my brother do today?
He stood up and fought for
his country.

679
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:19,842
And what did I do? I made
a papier-mâché lobster head.

680
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,803
What is this
we're listening to?

681
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,930
Joni Mitchell.

682
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,891
I can't believe
you still listen
to Joni Mitchell.

683
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:31,770
I love her and true
love lasts a lifetime.

684
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,857
Joni Mitchell is
the woman who taught

685
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,026
your cold English wife
how to feel.

686
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,194
Did she?
Well, that's good.

687
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,947
I must write to her
sometime and say thanks.

688
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,160
Now,
which doll should we give
Daisy's little friend Emily?

689
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,995
The one that looks
like a transvestite

690
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,289
or the
one that looks
like a dominatrix?

691
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,877
<i>It's almost enough to
make you feel patriotic,</i>

692
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,087
<i>so here's one for our
ass-kicking prime minister.</i>

693
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,714
<i>I think he'll enjoy this.</i>

694
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,341
<i>A golden oldie
for a golden oldie.</i>

695
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,185
Yeah...

696
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,229
Mary, I've been thinking,

697
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:58,732
can we move the Japanese
ambassador to 4:00 tomorrow?

698
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,858
Certainly, sir.

699
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,860
Terrific.
Thanks so much.

700
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,995
Would you like the last...

701
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,752
That's all right,
more for me.

702
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,133
I'm very lucky I've got
one of those constitutions

703
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,927
where I never
put on weight.

704
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,764
Hello.

705
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,401
Sorry.

706
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,614
Hello?

707
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,048
Thank you.

708
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,927
No. Hold on.

709
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,847
God, it's half the book. No.

710
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,100
Just
leave them, please!
They're not important.

711
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,145
They're not worth it!

712
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,439
Stop! Stop.

713
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,154
It's all just rubbish.

714
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,074
Just leave it.

715
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,755
God, she's in.

716
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,052
Right. And now she'll think
I'm a total spaz if I don't
go in too.

717
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,102
Fuck, it's freezing! Fuck!

718
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,276
It's not worth it.
This isn't bloody
Shakespeare.

719
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,449
Just stop. Stop.

720
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,496
I really must do copies.

721
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,166
There'd better
not be eels in here.
I can't stand eels.

722
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,296
Oh, God,
what the hell is that?

723
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,517
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

724
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,191
I know. I'll name one of
the characters after you.

725
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:57,244
Or
I could give you
5% of the profits.

726
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,971
Yes. It's...

727
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,312
Crime. Crime, murder.

728
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,193
Scary? Yes,
sometimes scary.

729
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:34,781
And sometimes not.
Mainly scary how
bad the writing is.

730
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:56,970
Sure.

731
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,311
It's my favorite time of day,

732
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,438
driving you.

733
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,577
Sorry.

734
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,441
<i>And coming up
later this morning, it's
this guy...</i>

735
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,533
<i>The bad granddad
of rock and roll,</i>

736
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,369
<i>here at 10:30.
Do not switch off.</i>

737
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,168
Banoffee pie?

738
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,170
No, thanks.

739
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:15,590
Thank God.
You would've broken my
heart if you'd said yes.

740
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:19,010
Right, well, lucky you.

741
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,221
Can I come in?

742
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,265
Yeah, well,
I'm a bit busy...

743
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,350
Well, I was just passing,
and I thought

744
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,811
we might check
that video thing out.

745
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,939
I thought
I might be able to
swap it for some pie

746
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,400
or maybe Munchies?

747
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,944
Actually,
I was being serious.
I don't know where it is.

748
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,238
I'll have a poke
around tonight then...

749
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,074
Mark, can I say something?

750
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:43,159
Yeah.

751
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,371
I know you're Peter's
best friend,

752
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:51,751
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

753
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,920
No, don't argue.

754
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,173
We've never
got friendly.

755
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,801
But I
just wanted to say,
I hope that can change.

756
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,720
I'm nice.
I really am.

757
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:04,306
Apart
from my terrible
taste in pie and...

758
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,934
It would be great
if we could be
friends.

759
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,562
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

760
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,525
Great.

761
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,613
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video, though.

762
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,656
I had a real search
when you first called

763
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,366
and couldn't find
any trace of it
so...

764
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,578
Well,
there's one here that says,
"Peter and Juliet's Wedding."

765
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,914
Do you think we might
be on the right track?

766
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:33,543
Yeah, well...
Wow. That could be it.

767
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,003
Do you mind if I just...

768
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,087
I've probably
taped over it.

769
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,257
Almost
everything has episodes
of <i>West Wing</i> on it and...

770
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,431
Oh, bingo.

771
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,435
That's lovely.

772
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,354
Well done, you.

773
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,066
That's gorgeous.

774
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:01,529
Thank you so much, Mark.
This is exactly what I
was hoping for.

775
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,789
I look quite pretty.

776
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,339
You've stayed rather close,
haven't you?

777
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,854
They're all of me.

778
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,778
Yeah. Yeah.

779
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,864
Yes.

780
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,313
But

781
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,441
you never talk to me.

782
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,695
You always talk to Peter.

783
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,533
You don't like me.

784
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,912
I hope it's useful.

785
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,998
Don't show it
around too much.

786
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:20,168
Needs a bit of editing.

787
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:23,880
Look,
I've got to
get to a lunch.

788
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,007
Early lunch.

789
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:29,094
You can just show
yourself out,
can't you?

790
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:38,937
It's a self-preservation
thing, you see.

791
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,789
Yeah.

792
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,712
Annie, my darling,
my dream, my boat.

793
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,842
Need you to do
a favor for me.

794
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,053
Of course.
Anything for the
hero of the hour.

795
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,766
Don't ask me why,
and for heaven's sake,
don't read stuff into this,

796
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,186
it's just a weird
personality thing.

797
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,355
But you know Natalie
who works here?

798
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,066
The chubby girl?

799
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,152
Would we call her chubby?

800
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:12,405
I think there's a pretty
sizeable ass there, yes,
sir.

801
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,157
Huge thighs.

802
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,827
Yeah. Well, whatever.

803
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,874
I'm sure
she's a lovely girl,
but I wonder if you could

804
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,295
redistribute her?

805
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,798
It's done.

806
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,710
Hey, Sammo. Can't sleep?

807
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,797
I got some
terrible news today.

808
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,757
Let's have it.

809
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,759
Joanna's going
back to America.

810
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:16,094
Your girl's American?

811
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,513
Yes, she's American.

812
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,848
And she's not my girl.

813
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,809
And she's going
back to America.

814
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,852
That's the end of
my life as I know it.

815
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,272
That is bad news.

816
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,734
Well, we need Kate

817
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,862
and we need Leo,
and we need them now.

818
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,781
Come on.

819
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,162
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

820
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,790
<i>Keep your eyes closed.</i>

821
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,583
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

822
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,627
<i>I trust you.</i>

823
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,088
Do you trust me?

824
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,464
I trust you.

825
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,716
Fool!

826
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,592
Get off, you big bully.

827
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,681
<i>All right, open your eyes.</i>

828
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,771
You know,
Sammy, I'm sure she's
unique and extraordinary,

829
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,691
but general wisdom
is that in the end,

830
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,152
there isn't just one
person for each of us.

831
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,281
There was
for Kate and Leo.

832
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,075
There was for you.

833
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,994
And there is for me.

834
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,038
She's the one.

835
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:29,667
Fair enough.
And her name's Joanna?

836
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,504
Yeah, I know. Same as Mom.

837
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,099
Yeah.

838
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,022
Prime Minister.

839
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,732
Thank you very much.

840
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,619
Well, goodbye.

841
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:53,918
It was...

842
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:11,621
<i>You know
I love Christmas,
I always will</i>

843
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:17,335
<i>My mind's made up,
the way that I feel</i>

844
01:03:18,794 --> 01:03:22,924
<i>There's
no beginning,
there'll be no end</i>

845
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:37,021
Daniel!

846
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,440
I have a plan.

847
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:42,026
Thank the Lord! Tell me.

848
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:45,863
Well, girls love
musicians, don't they?
Uh-huh.

849
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,282
Even the really weird
ones get girlfriends.
That's right.

850
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,535
Meat Loaf definitely
got laid at least once.

851
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:53,663
For God's
sake, Ringo Starr
married a Bond girl.

852
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:59,001
Whatever. There's this big
concert at the end of term
and Joanna's in it.

853
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,713
And I thought maybe
if I was in the band and
played absolutely superbly,

854
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,924
there's a chance that she
might actually fall in
love with me.

855
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,050
What do you think?

856
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:08,844
I think
it's brilliant.
I think it's stellar.

857
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:12,640
Apart
from the one obvious tiny,
little, baby, little hiccup.

858
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,976
I don't play
a musical instrument?

859
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,143
Yes, sir.

860
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:19,146
A tiny, insignificant detail.

861
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,312
I suppose
I'd better go and
do the duty round.

862
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,397
You're a saint.

863
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:11,240
Any chance of a dance
with the boss?

864
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,452
Yeah, sure, sure.

865
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:17,204
As long as your boyfriend
doesn't mind.

866
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,917
Not my boyfriend.

867
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:39,268
You're looking
very pretty tonight.

868
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:43,064
It's for you.

869
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,859
Sorry?

870
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:51,364
It's all for you, sir.

871
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,389
<i>This must be a very
exciting moment for you,</i>

872
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,557
<i>fighting for the
Christmas number
one.</i>

873
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,059
<i>How's it looking so far?</i>

874
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,602
<i>Very bad indeed.</i>

875
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,064
<i>Blue are outselling me
five-to-one,</i>

876
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,358
<i>but I'm hoping
for a late surge.</i>

877
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,153
<i>And, if I reach number one,</i>

878
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:37,159
<i>I promise to sing
a song stark naked
on TV on Christmas Eve.</i>

879
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,453
<i>Do you mean that?</i>

880
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:40,788
<i>Well, of course
I mean it, Michael.</i>

881
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,416
<i>Do you want a preview?
You old flirt.</i>

882
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,505
<i>That'll never
make number one.</i>

883
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,890
I suppose it's his job
to dance with everyone,
isn't it?

884
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,268
Some more than others.

885
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,565
Just one dance?

886
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:09,275
Before we run
out of chances.

887
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,110
Who, me?

888
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,862
Unless you just...

889
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:15,072
No! No! Good.

890
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,241
Yes. Thanks.

891
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,707
Well, then.
I'd better go.

892
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,876
Okay.

893
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:54,505
Good night.
Good night.

894
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:13,566
Actually,

895
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:15,860
I don't have to go.
Right. Good.

896
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:18,195
I mean...
No, that's good.

897
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:22,741
Just...
Would you excuse
me for one second?

898
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:25,286
Sure.
Just one second.

899
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,671
Okay, that's done.

900
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:41,552
Why don't you
come upstairs in
about 10 seconds?

901
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,929
Ten seconds.
Ten seconds.

902
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,783
Just tug it.

903
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:46,992
Okay.

904
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:10,057
You're beautiful.

905
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:36,625
I'd better answer that.

906
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,133
Hello. Hi.
Hello, darling.

907
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:47,094
No, no,
I'm not busy.
No, fire away.

908
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,847
Right.

909
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:54,309
Yes, I...
I'm not quite sure
it's gonna be possible

910
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,812
to get the Pope on
the phone tonight
but...

911
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:03,610
Yes. Yes, I'm sure
he's very good at
exorcism but...

912
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,450
Well, I'm sure

913
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:13,370
Jon Bon Jovi is as well,
and I'll definitely
look into it.

914
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:17,166
Okay? Okay,
I'll talk to you later.

915
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:19,334
All right, bye-bye.

916
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:26,508
Sorry about that.

917
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,510
No, it's fine.

918
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,555
It's my brother.
He's not well.
He calls a lot.

919
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:36,060
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine. It's fine.

920
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:39,396
I mean,
it's not really
fine. It is what it is,

921
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,941
and sort of there
being no parents now,
and us being over here,

922
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:46,070
it's my job to keep an eye
on him. I mean, not my job.

923
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,197
Obviously,
I'm glad to do it...

924
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,032
That's okay.

925
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:53,952
I mean, life is full
of interruptions and
complications.

926
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:57,790
So...

927
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,767
Will it make him better?

928
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:19,853
No.

929
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,939
Then maybe

930
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,775
don't answer.

931
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,827
Hey. How you doing?

932
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:38,622
Right, right. No, please.

933
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:42,084
Please, please,
don't, little darling.

934
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:46,713
Between the two of
us we'll find the answer
and it won't hurt anymore.

935
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:50,759
No, no.
No, I'm not busy. I...

936
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:55,722
Of course
if you want me
to come over I will.

937
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,560
Okay.

938
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,446
That was a good night.

939
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:12,906
Except I felt fat.

940
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,199
Don't be ridiculous.

941
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:15,701
It's true.

942
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:19,955
Nowadays the only clothes
I can get into were once
owned by Pavarotti.

943
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,833
I always think
Pavarotti dresses very well.

944
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,630
Mia's very pretty.

945
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,634
Is she?

946
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,972
You know she is, darling.

947
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,183
Be careful there.

948
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:05,042
Have you been watching
stuff on TV?

949
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,170
Yeah.

950
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,298
Every night.
Good.

951
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:13,467
And every day.

952
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:21,808
The nurses are
trying to kill me.

953
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:24,019
Nobody's trying
to kill you, babe.

954
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:33,737
Thank you.

955
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:38,784
Don't do that, my darling.

956
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:43,121
Thank you.

957
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,172
Don't do that.

958
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,833
Right.
Back at 3:00.
Christmas shopping,

959
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,584
never an easy or
a pleasant task.

960
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,586
Are you gonna
get me something?

961
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,260
I don't know,
I hadn't thought.

962
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,220
And where's Sarah,
by the way?

963
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,931
She couldn't make it
in today. Family thing.

964
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:46,685
There's
a word for hangover
I've never heard before.

965
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:48,478
See you later.

966
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:51,189
Yes. Looking forward to it.

967
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:56,320
A lot.

968
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:10,834
So are you gonna
give me something?

969
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:14,296
I thought I made
it clear last night.

970
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:16,923
When it comes to me,
you can have everything.

971
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:21,720
So, what do you need?

972
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:26,808
Something along
the stationery line?
Are you short of staplers?

973
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:30,604
No. I don't want
something I need.

974
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:33,982
I want something I want,
something pretty.

975
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:37,027
Right.

976
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:39,988
Right.

977
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:51,291
Sorry I'm late.
I had to drop off
Bernie at rehearsal.

978
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:57,839
Right, well, listen, you keep
yourself occupied for 10
minutes

979
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,967
while I go
and do the boring
stuff for our mothers.

980
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:25,492
Thank you.
Thank you.

981
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:27,994
Looking for anything
in particular, sir?

982
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:31,581
Yes. That necklace there,
how much is it?

983
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:33,959
It's £270.

984
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:38,463
All right. I'll have it.

985
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:39,714
Lovely.

986
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:45,679
Would you like
it gift-wrapped?

987
01:18:46,346 --> 01:18:47,806
Yes, all right.

988
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:49,015
Lovely.

989
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:53,770
Let me just
pop it in the box.

990
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:57,107
There.

991
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:59,818
Look,
could we be quite quick?

992
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,236
Certainly, sir.

993
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:04,072
Ready in
the flashiest of flashes.

994
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,706
There.
That's great.

995
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:15,917
Not quite finished.

996
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:20,172
Look, actually,
I don't need a bag.

997
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:21,882
I'll just put
it in my pocket.

998
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:23,467
This isn't a bag, sir.

999
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:25,093
Really?

1000
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,262
This is so much
more than a bag.

1001
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:52,579
Could we be
quite quick,
please?

1002
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:15,352
What's that?

1003
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:17,187
It's a cinnamon stick, sir.

1004
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,939
Actually,
I really can't wait.

1005
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:20,649
You won't regret it, sir.

1006
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,317
Want to bet?

1007
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,986
'Tis but
the work of a moment.

1008
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,825
There we go.
Almost finished.

1009
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,661
Almost finished?
What else can there be?

1010
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:33,995
Are you gonna
dip it in yogurt?

1011
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,497
Cover it with
chocolate buttons?

1012
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,542
No,
sir, we're going to pop
it in the Christmas box.

1013
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:40,085
But I don't want
a Christmas box.

1014
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:41,545
But you said you wanted it
gift-wrapped.

1015
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:42,712
I did but...

1016
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,047
This is the final flourish.

1017
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:45,173
Can I just pay?

1018
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:46,424
All we need now...

1019
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,968
Oh, God.

1020
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:49,052
...is a sprig of holly.

1021
01:20:49,135 --> 01:20:50,178
No, no, no, no.

1022
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,055
No bloody holly.
But, sir...

1023
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:54,266
Leave it. Leave it.
Just leave it.

1024
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,560
Loitering around the
jewelry section, I see.

1025
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:58,353
No.
I was just
looking around.

1026
01:20:58,436 --> 01:21:01,273
Don't worry.
My expectations
are not that high

1027
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:04,859
after 13 years of Mr. Oh-
but-you-always-love-scarves.

1028
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:07,404
Actually,
I do love this one.

1029
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:19,124
Hey!

1030
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,293
What are you doing here?

1031
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,671
Had to
rent out my flat
to pay for my ticket.

1032
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:28,008
You're not actually going
ahead with this genuinely
stupid plan?

1033
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:29,884
Yeah. I bloody am.

1034
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:33,388
You think this backpack
is full of clothes?
Like hell it is.

1035
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,182
It is chock-a-block
full of condoms.

1036
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:40,103
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect, keep that going.

1037
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:46,151
Look, sorry to be
a bit forward and
all that,

1038
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:48,820
but you don't fancy going
for a Christmas drink,
do you?

1039
01:21:48,903 --> 01:21:51,072
I mean,
nothing implied at all.

1040
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:56,119
Just maybe go and see
something Christmassy
or something.

1041
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:59,664
Obviously,
if you don't want to,
you don't have to. I...

1042
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,374
I'm rambling now, sorry.

1043
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,294
No. That would be lovely.

1044
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:07,172
Great.

1045
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:13,011
You know,
that is really great.

1046
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:14,888
Normally, I'm really shy
about this sort of thing.

1047
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:17,724
Takes me ages to get
the courage up,
so thank you.

1048
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,191
Explain to me again
why you're so late.

1049
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:29,486
For heaven's sake, woman,
can't a man have any secrets?

1050
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:33,823
We've been waiting for hours.
It's the first ever preview.

1051
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:46,628
It
was a starry night
in ancient Jerusalem

1052
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:49,798
and the baby Jesus was
in his manger.

1053
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:01,518
Sherlock Holmes is
not a real detective.

1054
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:08,233
I would like
half-pint of sherry.

1055
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:11,695
I would like
a one-day travel card.

1056
01:23:17,575 --> 01:23:20,704
Milton Keynes has
many roundabouts.

1057
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,770
You'll come back
a broken man.

1058
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,857
Yeah, back broken
from too much sex.

1059
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:51,109
You are on
the road to disaster.

1060
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:54,738
No, I am on shag highway,
heading west.

1061
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:57,407
Farewell, failure.

1062
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:01,244
America, watch out!
Here comes Colin Frissell.

1063
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:05,331
And he's got a big knob.

1064
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:16,885
Take me to a bar.

1065
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:18,094
What kind of bar?

1066
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:21,681
Just any bar. Just
your average American bar.

1067
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,190
Can I help you?

1068
01:24:30,273 --> 01:24:32,692
Yes. I'd like a Budweiser,
please.

1069
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:34,235
King of beers.

1070
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:35,820
One Bud coming up.

1071
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:38,448
Oh, my God.

1072
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:41,618
Are you from England?

1073
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:43,870
Yes.

1074
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:48,458
That is so cute.

1075
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:50,710
Hi, I'm Stacey.

1076
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:54,255
Jeannie?

1077
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:57,550
Yeah?

1078
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:00,220
This is...

1079
01:25:00,303 --> 01:25:01,596
Colin.

1080
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:05,225
Frissell.

1081
01:25:05,308 --> 01:25:07,101
Cute name.

1082
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:08,853
Jeannie.

1083
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,188
He's from England.

1084
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:12,398
Yep. Basildon.

1085
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:18,446
Wait till
Carol-Anne gets here.

1086
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,448
She's crazy
about English guys.

1087
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:26,871
Hey, girls.

1088
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,374
Carol-Anne, come meet Colin.

1089
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:30,959
He's from England.

1090
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:36,631
Well, step aside, ladies.
This one's on me.

1091
01:25:39,342 --> 01:25:41,302
Hey, gorgeous.

1092
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:45,598
That is so funny!

1093
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:49,060
What do you call that?

1094
01:25:49,143 --> 01:25:50,395
Bottle.

1095
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,938
Bottle.

1096
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:53,982
What about this?
Straw.

1097
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:55,817
Straw.

1098
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,819
What about this?
Table.

1099
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:01,155
Table. The same.
It's the same.

1100
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:03,366
Where are you staying?

1101
01:26:03,449 --> 01:26:05,285
I don't actually know.

1102
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:07,537
I guess I'll
just check into a motel
like they do in the movies.

1103
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:10,874
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, that is so cute.

1104
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:15,420
No, no, no, listen.
This may be a bit pushy
'cause we just met you,

1105
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:18,172
but why
don't you come back
and sleep at our place?

1106
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:20,341
Yeah.

1107
01:26:20,717 --> 01:26:23,553
Well, I mean,
you know, if it's not
too much of an inconvenience.

1108
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:25,179
Hell no!

1109
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:26,890
But there's one problem.

1110
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,183
What?

1111
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:32,562
Well, we're
not the richest
of girls, you know.

1112
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:37,400
So we just have
a little bed and no couch.

1113
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:40,945
So you'd
have to share
with all three of us.

1114
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:47,452
And on this cold,
cold night it's gonna be
crowded and sweaty and stuff.

1115
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:50,455
And
we can't even
afford pajamas.

1116
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:51,998
No?

1117
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:56,544
Which means we
would be naked.

1118
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:04,260
No, no, I think it'd be fine.

1119
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:05,345
Great.
Cool.

1120
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:09,557
The thing
that's gonna make
it more crowded...

1121
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:12,185
Harriet.
You haven't met Harriet.

1122
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,145
There's a fourth one?
Yeah.

1123
01:27:14,228 --> 01:27:18,274
Don't worry, you're
totally gonna like her
'cause she is the sexy one.

1124
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:21,194
Really? Wow.
Yeah.

1125
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:23,571
Praise the Lord!

1126
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:25,031
And he's a Christian.

1127
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:29,285
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1128
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:53,309
One present
only each tonight.
Who's got one for Dad?

1129
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,311
I have.
Let Mommy go first.

1130
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:56,437
I'll get it. I'll get it.

1131
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:58,439
No, no, no.
I want to choose mine.
I want to choose mine.

1132
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:00,733
I think I want

1133
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:04,028
this one.

1134
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,572
I have, of course, bought you
the traditional scarf as well,

1135
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:10,410
but this is my other,
slightly special,
personal one.

1136
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,121
Thank you.

1137
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,373
That's a real first.

1138
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:16,457
Rip it!

1139
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:17,542
What is it?

1140
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:20,628
I'm going to...
All right, I'll rip it.

1141
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,971
God, that's a surprise.

1142
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,265
What is it?

1143
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:37,687
It's a CD.
Joni Mitchell. Wow.

1144
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:40,356
To continue your
emotional education.

1145
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:44,569
Yes. Goodness.

1146
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:47,155
That's great.

1147
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:49,657
My brilliant wife.

1148
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:50,950
Yes.

1149
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:56,789
Actually, do you mind if
I just absent myself for
a second?

1150
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:59,459
All that ice cream.

1151
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:03,046
Darling,
could you just make sure
the kids are ready to go?

1152
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,547
I'll be back in a minute.

1153
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:06,924
All right, all right,
let's take it easy.

1154
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:08,676
Mine first. Mine.

1155
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:07,670
Oh, my God.

1156
01:31:07,753 --> 01:31:10,673
It's a miracle.
You're all dressed.

1157
01:31:10,756 --> 01:31:13,676
Come on,
come on, come on,
we're horribly late.

1158
01:31:13,759 --> 01:31:15,761
Right, then. Come on.
In the car. In the car.

1159
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:17,180
Come on.

1160
01:31:27,356 --> 01:31:28,774
Has she noticed you yet?

1161
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:30,484
No.

1162
01:31:30,776 --> 01:31:32,069
You know the thing
about romance is

1163
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:34,822
people
only get together
right at the very end.

1164
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:37,033
Of course.

1165
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:42,288
By the way, I feel bad.
I never ask you how
your love life is going.

1166
01:31:42,371 --> 01:31:43,706
Uh-huh.

1167
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,334
No.

1168
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:49,253
As you know, that was
a done deal long ago.

1169
01:31:50,796 --> 01:31:53,341
Unless, of course,
Claudia Schiffer calls,

1170
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:55,551
in which case
I want you out of
the house straightaway,

1171
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:57,678
you wee motherless mongrel.

1172
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:03,476
No, no. We'll want to have
sex in every room,
including yours.

1173
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:06,062
<i>It's a rainy
Christmas Eve all over
the UK</i>

1174
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:08,522
<i>and the big question
is who is number one</i>

1175
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:10,358
<i>on the Radio One
chart show tonight?</i>

1176
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:14,528
<i>Is it Blue or the
unexpected Christmas
sensation from Billy Mack?</i>

1177
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:18,616
<i>You might have guessed it,
although you may not
believe it.</i>

1178
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,868
<i>It's Billy Mack.</i>

1179
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:25,456
You are the champion!

1180
01:32:25,539 --> 01:32:26,916
<i>Hi, Billy.</i>

1181
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:28,000
Hello.

1182
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:31,629
<i>We're live
across the nation,
and you're number one.</i>

1183
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:33,256
<i>How will you
be celebrating?</i>

1184
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:34,590
I don't know.

1185
01:32:34,674 --> 01:32:37,677
Either I could behave like
a real rock and roll loser

1186
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:40,763
and get drunk
with my fat manager,

1187
01:32:40,846 --> 01:32:42,682
or, when I hang up,

1188
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:47,687
I'll be flooded by invitations
to a large number of glamorous
parties.

1189
01:32:47,937 --> 01:32:51,190
<i>Let's hope it's the latter.
And here it is. Number one,
from Billy Mack,</i>

1190
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,025
<i>it's</i> Christmas Is All Around.

1191
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:55,319
Jesus, not that crap again.

1192
01:32:58,864 --> 01:33:01,242
Bill, it's for you, babe.

1193
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:04,328
Hello. Elton.

1194
01:33:04,453 --> 01:33:07,707
Of course. Of course.

1195
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:11,002
Send an embarrassingly
big car, and I'll be there.

1196
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:16,882
It's gonna be
a very good Christmas.

1197
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:26,100
Right.

1198
01:33:26,183 --> 01:33:28,936
I'd better be getting inside,
actually. My mom and,
you know...

1199
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,814
Of course, yeah.
It's getting a
bit cold.

1200
01:33:34,692 --> 01:33:36,193
Well, good night.

1201
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:37,403
Night.

1202
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:48,831
Okay.

1203
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:06,974
All I want for Christmas
is you.

1204
01:34:09,685 --> 01:34:11,854
Right.

1205
01:34:11,937 --> 01:34:14,940
Thank you. Good.

1206
01:34:15,441 --> 01:34:16,692
Good night.

1207
01:34:30,956 --> 01:34:33,209
Look, everyone,
it's Uncle Jamie.

1208
01:34:33,292 --> 01:34:35,961
Hi, Uncle Jamie!

1209
01:34:36,045 --> 01:34:40,132
Yes, splendid.
It's lovely to
see you all.

1210
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,302
And...

1211
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,013
I'm off, actually.

1212
01:34:46,263 --> 01:34:49,016
But, Jamie, darling...

1213
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,352
Sorry.

1214
01:34:51,435 --> 01:34:53,979
Man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

1215
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:58,901
I hate Uncle Jamie!

1216
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:00,778
I hate Uncle Jamie.

1217
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:02,488
I hate Uncle Jamie.

1218
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:16,585
Gatwick Airport, please.
Fast as you can.

1219
01:35:31,725 --> 01:35:32,810
Night, Sarah.

1220
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:34,395
Night, Karl.

1221
01:35:35,438 --> 01:35:37,440
I...

1222
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:45,030
Merry Christmas.

1223
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:07,761
Hi, babe.
How's it going? Yeah.

1224
01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:10,389
Is it
all party, party,
party down there?

1225
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:31,118
Sam, time for dinner.

1226
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:32,453
I'm not hungry.

1227
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:35,873
Sam, I've done
chicken kebabs.

1228
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:38,042
Look at the sign
on the door.

1229
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:43,589
Right.

1230
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:52,765
It's a little long.

1231
01:37:01,023 --> 01:37:03,025
I'll get it.

1232
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:10,908
Hi.

1233
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:12,451
Who is it?

1234
01:37:17,122 --> 01:37:18,916
It's carol singers.

1235
01:37:19,124 --> 01:37:21,835
Give them a quid and
tell them to bugger off.

1236
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:36,035
Merry Christmas.

1237
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:14,156
Enough.

1238
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:16,950
Enough now.

1239
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:27,378
What the hell
are you doing here?

1240
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:29,380
You're supposed to
be at Elton John's.

1241
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:34,426
Well, I was there
for a minute or two,
and then I had an epiphany.

1242
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:37,262
Really?
Yeah.

1243
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:39,348
Come on. Just come up.

1244
01:39:39,515 --> 01:39:42,685
So what was this epiphany?

1245
01:39:42,768 --> 01:39:45,396
It was about Christmas.

1246
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:48,148
You realized
it was all around.

1247
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:51,110
No. I realized that
Christmas is the time

1248
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:53,112
to be with
the people you love.

1249
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:55,280
Right.

1250
01:39:55,364 --> 01:39:58,617
And I realized that,
as dire chance

1251
01:39:58,701 --> 01:40:01,870
and fateful cock-up
would have it,

1252
01:40:01,954 --> 01:40:05,791
here I am, mid-50s,

1253
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:09,420
and without knowing it,
I've gone and spent
most of my adult life

1254
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:11,880
with a chubby employee.

1255
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:16,135
And, much as it
grieves me to say it,

1256
01:40:16,218 --> 01:40:22,015
it might be that the
people I love is,
in fact,

1257
01:40:23,225 --> 01:40:24,226
you.

1258
01:40:27,354 --> 01:40:29,356
Well, this is a surprise.

1259
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:31,275
Yeah.

1260
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:33,777
Ten
minutes at Elton John's,
you're as gay as a Maypole.

1261
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,696
No, look.
I'm serious here.

1262
01:40:35,779 --> 01:40:37,614
I left Elton's
where there were

1263
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:40,075
a hefty number of
half-naked chicks

1264
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:45,164
with their mouths
open in order to hang
out with you at Christmas.

1265
01:40:47,332 --> 01:40:48,709
Well, Bill...

1266
01:40:48,792 --> 01:40:52,671
It's a terrible,
terrible mistake, chubs,

1267
01:40:56,884 --> 01:41:00,137
but you turn out to be
the fucking love of my
life.

1268
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:07,269
And to be honest,
despite all my
complaining,

1269
01:41:09,354 --> 01:41:11,732
we have had
a wonderful life.

1270
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:18,238
Well,

1271
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:21,742
thank you.

1272
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:26,580
I mean, come on,
it's been an honor.

1273
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:30,876
I feel very proud.

1274
01:41:30,959 --> 01:41:33,045
Look, don't be a moron.

1275
01:41:44,181 --> 01:41:47,267
Come on, let's get
pissed and watch porn.

1276
01:42:06,787 --> 01:42:09,248
<i>Dear sir...
Dear David,</i>

1277
01:42:09,331 --> 01:42:12,626
<i>Merry Christmas
and I hope you have
a very happy New Year.</i>

1278
01:42:12,918 --> 01:42:15,254
<i>I'm very sorry about
the thing that happened.</i>

1279
01:42:15,337 --> 01:42:18,382
<i>It was a very odd moment
and I feel like a prize
idiot.</i>

1280
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:20,384
<i>Particularly because,</i>

1281
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:23,220
<i>if you can't say it at
Christmas when can you,
eh,</i>

1282
01:42:23,303 --> 01:42:26,932
<i>I'm actually yours.
With love, your Natalie.</i>

1283
01:42:47,327 --> 01:42:49,204
Jack, yeah, I need a car.

1284
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:51,498
Right now. Thank you.

1285
01:43:03,302 --> 01:43:05,345
Don't wait up.

1286
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:11,268
I'd like to go to Wandsworth,
the dodgy end.

1287
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:12,811
Very good, sir.

1288
01:43:24,531 --> 01:43:27,242
- Harris Street.
- What number, sir?

1289
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:30,037
God,
it's the longest
street in the world,

1290
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,997
and I have
absolutely no idea.

1291
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:42,466
Hello.
Does Natalie live here?

1292
01:43:42,925 --> 01:43:44,009
No.

1293
01:43:44,092 --> 01:43:45,928
Right, fine.
Thank you. Sorry to disturb.

1294
01:43:46,011 --> 01:43:48,055
Hey, aren't...

1295
01:43:48,388 --> 01:43:51,350
Aren't you
the prime minister?

1296
01:43:51,433 --> 01:43:54,728
Yes.
In fact, I am.
Merry Christmas.

1297
01:43:56,396 --> 01:43:57,481
Part of the service now.

1298
01:43:57,564 --> 01:43:59,650
Trying to get around to
everyone by New Year's Eve.

1299
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:08,033
Hello.
Does Natalie live here?

1300
01:44:08,116 --> 01:44:09,242
No, she doesn't.

1301
01:44:09,326 --> 01:44:10,452
Oh, dear. Okay.

1302
01:44:10,535 --> 01:44:12,496
Are you singing carols?

1303
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:13,747
No. No, I'm not.

1304
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:15,582
Please, sir, please.

1305
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:16,959
Please.

1306
01:44:20,045 --> 01:44:21,797
Well, I suppose I could.

1307
01:44:22,214 --> 01:44:23,799
Please.

1308
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:26,468
All right.

1309
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:32,766
<i>Good King Wenceslas
looked out</i>

1310
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:36,520
<i>On the feast of Stephen</i>

1311
01:44:36,603 --> 01:44:39,690
<i>When the snow
lay round about</i>

1312
01:44:40,065 --> 01:44:43,360
<i>Deep and crisp and even</i>

1313
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:47,030
<i>Brightly shone
the moon that night</i>

1314
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:51,576
Hello.
Sorry to disturb.
Does Natalie live here?

1315
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:53,912
No. She lives next door.

1316
01:44:57,624 --> 01:44:58,625
Ah!

1317
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:00,502
Brilliant.

1318
01:45:00,585 --> 01:45:02,838
You're not who I think
you are, are you?

1319
01:45:02,921 --> 01:45:05,215
Yes, I'm afraid I am,
and I'm sorry about
all the cock-ups.

1320
01:45:05,298 --> 01:45:07,384
Not my fault.
My cabinet are
absolute crap.

1321
01:45:07,467 --> 01:45:11,013
We hope to
do better next year.
Merry Christmas to you.

1322
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:28,405
Ah!

1323
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:31,867
Hello. Is Natalie in?

1324
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:34,745
Where the fuck
is my fucking coat?

1325
01:45:36,329 --> 01:45:37,414
Oh!

1326
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:40,500
Hello.

1327
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:45,464
This is my mom and my dad and
my Uncle Tony and my Auntie
Glynne.

1328
01:45:45,547 --> 01:45:47,382
Hello.
Very nice to meet you.

1329
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:51,386
And this is
the prime minister.

1330
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:54,473
Yes, we can see that,
darling.

1331
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:57,100
And,
unfortunately,
we're very late.

1332
01:45:57,184 --> 01:46:00,145
It's the
school Christmas
concert, you see, David.

1333
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:01,897
It's the first time
all the local schools

1334
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:03,857
have joined together,
even St. Basil's...

1335
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,192
Too much detail, Mom.

1336
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:07,569
Anyway,
how can we help, sir?

1337
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:11,656
Well, I just needed Natalie

1338
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:16,495
on some state business.

1339
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:23,001
Right, yes.
Of course. Right.

1340
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:25,629
Well,
perhaps you should
come on later, Plumpy.

1341
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:27,380
Natalie.

1342
01:46:27,464 --> 01:46:29,758
Well, listen,
I don't want to make
you late for the concert.

1343
01:46:29,841 --> 01:46:31,635
No, it's nothing, really.

1344
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:33,178
Keith will be
very disappointed.

1345
01:46:33,261 --> 01:46:35,222
No, really,
it doesn't matter.

1346
01:46:35,305 --> 01:46:37,516
The octopus costume's
taken me months.

1347
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:39,810
Eight is a lot
of legs, David.

1348
01:46:39,976 --> 01:46:40,977
Hmm.

1349
01:46:43,855 --> 01:46:46,233
Well, listen,
why don't I give you a lift,

1350
01:46:46,316 --> 01:46:51,238
and then we can talk about
this state business
business in the car?

1351
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:54,658
Okay.

1352
01:46:54,741 --> 01:46:56,493
Lovely, yes.
Lovely.

1353
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:57,661
Thank you.

1354
01:46:57,744 --> 01:46:59,538
Hold tight, everybody.

1355
01:47:06,545 --> 01:47:07,712
How far is this place?

1356
01:47:07,796 --> 01:47:09,172
Just round the corner.

1357
01:47:09,256 --> 01:47:11,842
Right. Well...

1358
01:47:13,718 --> 01:47:15,887
I just wanted to say

1359
01:47:17,889 --> 01:47:19,933
thank you for
the Christmas card.

1360
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:21,852
You're welcome.

1361
01:47:22,144 --> 01:47:24,187
Look,
I'm so sorry
about that day.

1362
01:47:24,354 --> 01:47:26,064
I mean,
I came into the room
and he slinked towards me

1363
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:27,274
and there was a fire

1364
01:47:27,357 --> 01:47:28,942
and he's
the President of
the United States

1365
01:47:29,025 --> 01:47:31,528
and nothing happened,
I promise.

1366
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:34,614
And I just felt like
such a fool because

1367
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:38,243
I think about you
all the time, actually.

1368
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:39,744
And I think you're
the man I really...

1369
01:47:39,828 --> 01:47:41,872
We're here.

1370
01:47:41,955 --> 01:47:43,540
...love.
Oh, wow.

1371
01:47:43,665 --> 01:47:46,209
That really was
just round the corner.

1372
01:48:01,641 --> 01:48:03,602
Well, look, I...

1373
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,731
I think I'd better
not come in, you know?

1374
01:48:08,773 --> 01:48:12,319
Last thing anyone wants
is some sleazy politician
stealing the kids' thunder.

1375
01:48:12,402 --> 01:48:16,031
No,
please come.
It'll be great.

1376
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:19,159
No, I'd...
I'd better not.

1377
01:48:20,035 --> 01:48:24,623
But I will be very sorry

1378
01:48:24,706 --> 01:48:26,750
to drive away from you.

1379
01:48:28,501 --> 01:48:30,629
Just give me one second.

1380
01:48:44,726 --> 01:48:47,729
John's
been very mysterious.
Where did you two meet?

1381
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:56,071
No!

1382
01:49:27,769 --> 01:49:30,438
Come on in.
We can watch
from backstage.

1383
01:49:31,147 --> 01:49:33,275
Okay. Terry,
I won't be long.

1384
01:49:36,778 --> 01:49:39,781
Look, this has to be
a very secret visit,
okay?

1385
01:49:39,864 --> 01:49:41,366
Don't worry.
This was my school.

1386
01:49:41,449 --> 01:49:43,451
I know my way around.
Come on.

1387
01:49:46,913 --> 01:49:49,666
Look, the sheep
are ready already
and you're not even...

1388
01:49:49,749 --> 01:49:51,501
David.

1389
01:49:53,712 --> 01:49:55,964
How are you?

1390
01:49:56,339 --> 01:50:00,010
Hi, guys. Hey, hey, hey.
You all right?

1391
01:50:00,593 --> 01:50:02,721
What the hell
are you doing here?

1392
01:50:02,804 --> 01:50:03,805
Well, you know...

1393
01:50:03,888 --> 01:50:05,724
Well, I always tell your
secretary's secretary's
secretary

1394
01:50:05,807 --> 01:50:08,643
that these
things are going on,
but it never occurred to me

1395
01:50:08,727 --> 01:50:10,270
you'd actually turn up.

1396
01:50:10,353 --> 01:50:12,355
I thought it was
about time I did.

1397
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:13,648
I just didn't
want anyone to see,

1398
01:50:13,732 --> 01:50:15,859
so I'm gonna hide myself
somewhere and watch the show.

1399
01:50:15,942 --> 01:50:18,570
Good luck, good luck, Daisy.
Good luck, Bernie.

1400
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:22,198
I have to tell you,
I've never been gladder
to see my stupid big brother.

1401
01:50:22,282 --> 01:50:23,450
Thank you.

1402
01:50:23,533 --> 01:50:24,826
All right.

1403
01:50:25,869 --> 01:50:28,455
Now, we haven't
been introduced.

1404
01:50:28,872 --> 01:50:31,750
Right. Well, this is Gavin.

1405
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:32,876
Hello, Gavin.

1406
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:34,085
My copper.

1407
01:50:34,169 --> 01:50:36,129
And this is Natalie,
who's my...

1408
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:38,882
Who's my
catering manager.

1409
01:50:39,632 --> 01:50:41,384
Hi.
Catering manager.

1410
01:50:41,468 --> 01:50:43,636
Watch out he keeps
his hands off you.

1411
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:45,430
Twenty years ago,
you'd have been
just his type.

1412
01:50:45,513 --> 01:50:49,184
I'll be very careful.
Don't try something, sir,
just because it's Christmas.

1413
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:51,770
No, seriously.

1414
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:56,316
Come on.
Showtime. Quickly.
Look, see you after, yeah?

1415
01:50:56,399 --> 01:50:57,859
Yeah, probably. Yeah.

1416
01:50:57,942 --> 01:51:00,028
Thank you, Prime Minister.

1417
01:51:00,111 --> 01:51:01,154
It's all right.

1418
01:51:01,237 --> 01:51:02,697
Come on.
Right.

1419
01:51:02,781 --> 01:51:06,910
<i>Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket</i>

1420
01:51:07,077 --> 01:51:11,414
<i>Save it for a rainy day</i>

1421
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:15,377
<i>Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket</i>

1422
01:51:15,668 --> 01:51:18,963
<i>Never let it fade away</i>

1423
01:51:19,923 --> 01:51:23,843
<i>Never let it fade away</i>

1424
01:51:24,469 --> 01:51:29,391
<i>Never let it fade away</i>

1425
01:51:37,065 --> 01:51:38,650
<i>Hillier School would
now like to present</i>

1426
01:51:38,733 --> 01:51:40,610
<i>their chosen
Christmas number.</i>

1427
01:51:40,693 --> 01:51:43,696
<i>Lead vocals by 10-year-old
Joanna Anderson,</i>

1428
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:48,576
<i>backing vocals
coordinated by her mother,
the great Mrs. Jean Anderson.</i>

1429
01:51:48,993 --> 01:51:51,746
<i>Some of the staff
have decided to
help out,</i>

1430
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:56,126
<i>and for this,
we ask you to forgive us.</i>

1431
01:51:56,543 --> 01:51:58,086
<i>Thank you.</i>

1432
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:07,720
<i>I don't want
a lot for Christmas</i>

1433
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:11,850
<i>There's just one thing I need</i>

1434
01:52:11,933 --> 01:52:15,103
<i>I don't care
about the presents</i>

1435
01:52:15,478 --> 01:52:19,190
<i>Underneath
the Christmas tree</i>

1436
01:52:19,357 --> 01:52:22,861
<i>I just want you for my own</i>

1437
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:26,865
<i>More than you
could ever know</i>

1438
01:52:26,948 --> 01:52:30,702
<i>Make my wish come true</i>

1439
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:34,831
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1440
01:52:35,206 --> 01:52:42,213
<i>Is you</i>

1441
01:52:45,049 --> 01:52:47,802
<i>I don't want
a lot for Christmas</i>

1442
01:52:47,886 --> 01:52:51,055
<i>There's just
one thing I need</i>

1443
01:52:51,389 --> 01:52:54,100
<i>I don't care
about the presents</i>

1444
01:52:54,184 --> 01:52:57,228
<i>Underneath
the Christmas tree</i>

1445
01:52:57,353 --> 01:53:00,482
<i>I just want you for my own</i>

1446
01:53:00,565 --> 01:53:03,610
<i>More than you
could ever know</i>

1447
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:06,821
<i>Make my wish come true</i>

1448
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:11,534
<i>All I want for Christmas
is you</i>

1449
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:15,872
<i>You, baby</i>

1450
01:53:15,955 --> 01:53:19,501
<i>All the lights are shining</i>

1451
01:53:19,584 --> 01:53:23,505
<i>So brightly everywhere</i>

1452
01:53:23,671 --> 01:53:27,800
<i>And the sound of
children's laughter
fills the air</i>

1453
01:53:27,884 --> 01:53:29,844
<i>Laughter fills the air</i>

1454
01:53:29,928 --> 01:53:31,763
<i>Everyone is singing</i>

1455
01:53:31,846 --> 01:53:32,847
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1456
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:35,433
<i>I hear those
sleigh bells ringing</i>

1457
01:53:35,558 --> 01:53:38,144
<i>Santa,
won't you bring me my honey?</i>

1458
01:53:38,228 --> 01:53:41,773
<i>Won't you please
bring my baby to me?</i>

1459
01:53:41,856 --> 01:53:44,943
<i>I don't want
a lot for Christmas</i>

1460
01:53:45,026 --> 01:53:46,945
<i>This is all I'm asking for</i>

1461
01:53:47,028 --> 01:53:48,613
<i>All I'm asking for</i>

1462
01:53:48,696 --> 01:53:51,407
<i>I just wanna see my baby</i>

1463
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:54,494
<i>Standing right
outside my door</i>

1464
01:53:54,619 --> 01:53:57,163
<i>'Cause I just
want you for my own</i>

1465
01:53:57,872 --> 01:53:59,290
<i>More than you
could ever know</i>

1466
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:01,000
<i>You will ever know</i>

1467
01:54:01,084 --> 01:54:03,962
<i>Make my wish come true</i>

1468
01:54:04,045 --> 01:54:08,007
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1469
01:54:08,091 --> 01:54:11,761
<i>Is you</i>

1470
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:14,305
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1471
01:54:14,556 --> 01:54:17,934
<i>And you and you</i>

1472
01:54:18,184 --> 01:54:19,435
<i>And you and you</i>

1473
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:21,145
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1474
01:54:21,604 --> 01:54:24,983
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1475
01:54:41,708 --> 01:54:43,626
Right.

1476
01:54:46,921 --> 01:54:48,923
So, not quite as secret
as we'd hoped.

1477
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:50,508
What do we do now?

1478
01:54:50,592 --> 01:54:51,634
Smile.

1479
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:54,304
Little bow.

1480
01:54:57,807 --> 01:54:59,892
And a wave.

1481
01:55:13,573 --> 01:55:16,409
Absolutely no idea.
I mean, can you imagine?

1482
01:55:16,492 --> 01:55:18,494
I'll see you later,
all right?

1483
01:55:18,578 --> 01:55:20,663
I'll speak to you. Bye.

1484
01:55:23,499 --> 01:55:27,462
Tell me, if you
were in my position,
what would you do?

1485
01:55:27,837 --> 01:55:29,756
What position is that?

1486
01:55:29,839 --> 01:55:33,635
Imagine your husband
bought a gold necklace

1487
01:55:33,718 --> 01:55:36,721
and, come Christmas,
gave it to somebody
else.

1488
01:55:36,929 --> 01:55:37,930
Karen...

1489
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:39,265
Would you wait around
to find out...

1490
01:55:39,349 --> 01:55:40,350
Good night.

1491
01:55:40,433 --> 01:55:42,060
Night, darling.
Happy Christmas.

1492
01:55:42,143 --> 01:55:45,146
Would you wait around
to find out if it's
just a necklace

1493
01:55:45,229 --> 01:55:47,690
or if it's sex
and a necklace

1494
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:51,110
or if, worst of all,
it's a necklace and
love?

1495
01:55:52,945 --> 01:55:54,155
Would you stay?

1496
01:55:54,238 --> 01:55:57,116
Knowing life
would always be
a little bit worse?

1497
01:55:58,076 --> 01:55:59,077
Or would you cut and run?

1498
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,371
Oh, God.

1499
01:56:06,209 --> 01:56:08,878
I am so in the wrong.

1500
01:56:09,045 --> 01:56:11,005
A classic fool.

1501
01:56:11,255 --> 01:56:14,300
Yes, but you've also
made a fool out of me.

1502
01:56:14,384 --> 01:56:17,136
You've
made the life
I lead foolish, too.

1503
01:56:19,597 --> 01:56:22,433
Darling. Darlings!

1504
01:56:22,517 --> 01:56:25,978
You were wonderful.

1505
01:56:26,062 --> 01:56:28,856
My little lobster,
you were so...

1506
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:31,150
What is that word?

1507
01:56:31,317 --> 01:56:33,194
Orange.

1508
01:56:33,653 --> 01:56:36,614
Come on,
I've got treats at
home. Dad's coming.

1509
01:56:38,157 --> 01:56:42,704
Sammy! Fantastic show!
Classic drumming, Son.

1510
01:56:43,079 --> 01:56:45,957
Thanks.
Plan didn't work, though.

1511
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:47,041
Tell her, then.

1512
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:49,210
Tell her what?
Tell her that you love her.

1513
01:56:49,293 --> 01:56:52,088
No way.
Anyway, they fly tonight.

1514
01:56:52,171 --> 01:56:55,633
Even better.
Sam, you've got
nothing to lose,

1515
01:56:55,717 --> 01:56:58,219
and you'll always
regret it if you don't.

1516
01:56:59,345 --> 01:57:01,222
I never told
your mom enough.

1517
01:57:01,305 --> 01:57:02,724
I should have
told her every day,

1518
01:57:02,807 --> 01:57:05,601
because she was perfect
every day.

1519
01:57:07,019 --> 01:57:11,149
You've seen the films, kiddo.
It ain't over till it's over.

1520
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:15,778
Okay, Dad. Let's do it.

1521
01:57:16,070 --> 01:57:18,114
Let's go get the shit
kicked out of us by love.

1522
01:57:18,197 --> 01:57:19,198
Yes.

1523
01:57:20,158 --> 01:57:21,367
Just give me one sec.

1524
01:57:21,451 --> 01:57:22,493
Yeah.

1525
01:57:23,953 --> 01:57:25,079
I'm sorry.

1526
01:57:25,163 --> 01:57:26,247
Sorry.

1527
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:28,833
That's okay.

1528
01:57:28,916 --> 01:57:30,251
My fault.

1529
01:57:30,334 --> 01:57:32,003
No, no, really, it wasn't.

1530
01:57:32,754 --> 01:57:34,630
You're Sam's dad, aren't you?

1531
01:57:35,757 --> 01:57:38,509
Yeah. Stepdad, actually.

1532
01:57:39,594 --> 01:57:41,596
Daniel.
I'm Carol.

1533
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:43,389
Carol.

1534
01:57:43,639 --> 01:57:45,516
Okay, I'm back. Let's go.

1535
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,102
Yeah. Well...

1536
01:57:49,187 --> 01:57:51,397
I hope we'll meet again,
Karen.

1537
01:57:51,689 --> 01:57:52,899
Carol.

1538
01:57:55,735 --> 01:57:57,528
I'll make sure we do.

1539
01:57:57,612 --> 01:57:59,530
Yeah? Good.

1540
01:58:08,247 --> 01:58:09,707
Tell her.
What?

1541
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:11,250
You know...

1542
01:58:11,334 --> 01:58:13,252
Don't be such an arse.

1543
01:58:16,672 --> 01:58:18,674
Look, there she is.
Where?

1544
01:58:18,758 --> 01:58:20,259
Over there.

1545
01:58:22,887 --> 01:58:24,096
Oh, no.

1546
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:28,684
It's okay, we'll go to the
airport. I know a shortcut.

1547
01:59:39,171 --> 01:59:41,173
Wait. Wait.

1548
01:59:44,385 --> 01:59:45,761
Oh, no.

1549
01:59:57,481 --> 01:59:58,774
Look,
we're not actually flying.

1550
01:59:58,858 --> 02:00:01,152
You can't come through
without a boarding pass.

1551
02:00:01,235 --> 02:00:05,531
Not even to let
the boy say goodbye
to the love of his life?

1552
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:08,367
No.

1553
02:00:11,412 --> 02:00:13,539
I'm sorry, Sam.
Boarding pass, sir?

1554
02:00:14,749 --> 02:00:16,334
Just a moment,
I know I've got
it here somewhere.

1555
02:00:16,417 --> 02:00:18,461
Sorry.
Would you mind
hanging on to that?

1556
02:00:18,544 --> 02:00:20,296
Unless...
What?

1557
02:00:20,379 --> 02:00:21,672
Do you want to
make a run for it?

1558
02:00:21,756 --> 02:00:23,132
Hold on to that, as well.

1559
02:00:23,215 --> 02:00:24,425
You think I should?
Yeah.

1560
02:00:24,508 --> 02:00:26,135
Thank you. Hold those.

1561
02:00:26,218 --> 02:00:28,262
Okay.

1562
02:00:28,346 --> 02:00:29,347
Yes!

1563
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:32,433
No, I must have left them
where I was having
a cup of coffee.

1564
02:00:32,516 --> 02:00:33,851
I'm sorry.

1565
02:02:25,838 --> 02:02:27,840
Joanna.

1566
02:02:28,924 --> 02:02:30,926
Sam?

1567
02:02:34,221 --> 02:02:36,015
I thought you
didn't know my name.

1568
02:02:36,098 --> 02:02:37,349
Course I do.

1569
02:02:38,642 --> 02:02:42,188
Oh, Jesus.
Here, I've gotta run.

1570
02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:40,032
Thank you.

1571
02:05:41,992 --> 02:05:43,994
That will be nice.

1572
02:05:46,121 --> 02:05:48,791
Yes is being my answer.

1573
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:52,878
Easy question.

1574
02:05:59,551 --> 02:06:00,803
Bravo!

1575
02:06:27,454 --> 02:06:29,540
You learned English?

1576
02:06:29,957 --> 02:06:32,084
Just in cases.

1577
02:07:13,667 --> 02:07:15,002
Hello, Daisy.

1578
02:07:15,085 --> 02:07:16,795
This one's Greta.

1579
02:07:16,879 --> 02:07:17,880
Hello, Greta.

1580
02:07:19,882 --> 02:07:23,969
Here she is. This is Aurelia.
This is Juliet. This is Peter.

1581
02:07:24,094 --> 02:07:25,804
Mark, hi,
didn't see you there.

1582
02:07:25,888 --> 02:07:27,139
Yeah,
just thought
I'd tag along.

1583
02:07:27,222 --> 02:07:30,017
Jamie's friends
are so good-looking.

1584
02:07:30,392 --> 02:07:32,561
He never tells me this.

1585
02:07:32,811 --> 02:07:35,689
I think maybe now
I have made the
wrong choice,

1586
02:07:35,773 --> 02:07:37,566
picked wrong Englishman.

1587
02:07:37,649 --> 02:07:38,692
She can't speak
English properly.

1588
02:07:38,776 --> 02:07:40,694
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

1589
02:07:40,778 --> 02:07:42,863
Dad! Dad!

1590
02:07:44,865 --> 02:07:46,617
Oh, God.

1591
02:07:46,992 --> 02:07:47,993
Did you get us any presents?

1592
02:07:48,077 --> 02:07:49,995
As a matter of fact, I did.

1593
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:51,705
Thanks, Dad.

1594
02:07:55,417 --> 02:07:56,585
How are you?

1595
02:07:56,668 --> 02:07:58,420
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1596
02:08:00,297 --> 02:08:02,257
Good to have you back.

1597
02:08:02,341 --> 02:08:04,676
Come on. Home.

1598
02:08:07,638 --> 02:08:09,640
There she is.

1599
02:08:11,141 --> 02:08:13,727
Hi.

1600
02:08:13,811 --> 02:08:14,978
Hello.

1601
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:17,314
He should have kissed her.

1602
02:08:17,398 --> 02:08:18,941
No, that's cool.

1603
02:08:20,984 --> 02:08:23,529
Hey.
What are you
two doing here?

1604
02:08:24,530 --> 02:08:25,781
I might get a shag at last.

1605
02:08:25,864 --> 02:08:27,116
Naughty.

1606
02:08:27,199 --> 02:08:28,200
Got to go.

1607
02:08:28,283 --> 02:08:29,618
Bye.

1608
02:08:35,332 --> 02:08:38,043
Now, this is Harriet.

1609
02:08:39,169 --> 02:08:42,172
Hi.
Really pleased to meet you.

1610
02:08:42,256 --> 02:08:43,799
Hello, Harriet.

1611
02:08:43,882 --> 02:08:47,886
I hope you don't mind,
I sort of brought my
sister to stay.

1612
02:08:49,388 --> 02:08:53,851
This is Carla.
She's real friendly.

1613
02:08:54,435 --> 02:08:56,687
Hello, you must be Tony.

1614
02:08:57,980 --> 02:08:59,982
I heard you were gorgeous.

1615
02:09:12,619 --> 02:09:13,704
God, you weigh a lot.

1616
02:09:13,787 --> 02:09:14,997
Shut your face.
