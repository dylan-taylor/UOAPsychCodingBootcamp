1
00:00:33,308 --> 00:00:35,726
Oh, come on

2
00:00:35,727 --> 00:00:39,654
Save room for my love

3
00:00:40,023 --> 00:00:44,234
Save room for a moment to be with me

4
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:46,862
Save room for my love

5
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:48,947
Save a little

6
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,449
Save a little for me

7
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,792
Oh, I'm so full.

8
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:57,172
You were right,
I shouldn't have eaten all that bread.

9
00:00:57,415 --> 00:01:00,008
Want to split a dessert?

10
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,464
You okay? You seem a little off.

11
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:09,092
Yeah, I'm just trying to think about
what I want.

12
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:10,552
Yeah, me too.

13
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:14,139
Why don't we just say it at the
same time? One, two, three...

14
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,734
- I want a divorce.
- Crème brûlée.

15
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,002
- You can't get away.
- Aah!

16
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,497
It's okay, that's my fault.

17
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,375
Come on, let's get you to bed
before your parents get home.

18
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,835
No puppy eyes, you little maniac.

19
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:45,887
Go brush your teeth.

20
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:21,006
Aren't you gonna say anything?

21
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:27,596
Almost 25 years of marriage
and you have nothing to say?

22
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:34,603
Robbie.

23
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:36,888
Hey, Robbie, have you seen
Molly's homework?

24
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:38,724
- Get out.
- Oh, my God.

25
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,734
- Close the door.
- Um...

26
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:46,281
Okay, Robbie, I'm really sorry,
and I didn't see anything.

27
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,577
Oh, my God.

28
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,490
You're not talking, and you know
that only makes me talk more.

29
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:58,577
But maybe that's good, you know?
Because maybe I'll just say it.

30
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:02,922
Maybe... Maybe I'll just tell you
I slept with someone.

31
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,091
David Lindhagen. From work.

32
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,886
- You met him at the Christmas party.
- Please stop.

33
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:18,388
The last person in the world
I'd wanna hurt is you.

34
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:20,098
If you keep talking, I'm gonna get out.

35
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,893
I think the fact that I did it,
it just shows how broken we are.

36
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:27,147
- Okay.
- How much we really... Cal.

37
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:30,116
Oh, my God! Cal!

38
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:39,084
Are you okay?

39
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:45,048
I'll leave tonight. I'll sign whatever you
want. Just please stop talking about it.

40
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,177
Okay.

41
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,856
I'm sorry you had to see that.

42
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:12,242
No, you know, I should have knocked.

43
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,870
Just for the record,
I think about you while I do it.

44
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:25,997
- Robbie.
- I have this picture of you...

45
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:29,008
and I look at it the whole time.
- Stop it.

46
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:32,129
I love you, Jessica.

47
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,506
I am actually begging you to stop it.

48
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,926
And I know you're 17,
and I know I just turned 13...

49
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:40,345
which is the same age
as your little brother.

50
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,639
But soon our age difference
won't even matter.

51
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,152
Which is good, because I'm pretty sure
you're my soul mate.

52
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,862
Okay, um...

53
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,523
- Listen, Robbie...
- We're home.

54
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,450
- Shit.
- Hey.

55
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:55,819
Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Weaver, how was...?

56
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,821
Oh, my God. Uh, what happened?

57
00:04:57,822 --> 00:05:00,949
Mrs. Weaver said she wanted a divorce,
and I jumped out of the car.

58
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,243
- Cal. Honey...
- Well...

59
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:05,454
- Kids good? Everybody good?
- Dad?

60
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:08,123
- Oh.
- Oh. Hey, I didn't see you standing there.

61
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:09,875
- You're getting a divorce?
- Well, yes.

62
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,044
Uh, so, Jess,
did Molly get through dinner okay?

63
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:14,463
Yeah, yeah, she's...

64
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:17,632
- You jumped out of a moving car?
- I jumped out of a moving car.

65
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:20,135
- Did she fight you on broccoli?
- No, she didn't.

66
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,470
She always fights me.

67
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:24,306
- Sorry you had to find out this way.
- Sorry you jumped out of a car.

68
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:26,892
- I'm sorry if she fought you.
- It's okay.

69
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,059
I don't have any money.

70
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,020
Uh, sweetheart? Let's go to bed, okay?

71
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:33,823
Listen, why don't you grab your coat?
I'll drive you home. All right.

72
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,027
I don't care. I love him. I really do.

73
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:39,704
And, given the opportunity...

74
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:41,656
Yes, I would have his babies.

75
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:45,535
Seriously? Conan O'Brien?
You would do Conan O'Brien?

76
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:46,953
Oh, my God, yes.

77
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:50,089
Ew. Friend to friend, ew.

78
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:54,302
I don't know. Your life is so PG-13.

79
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,839
- My life is not PG-13.
- Oh, it so is.

80
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,382
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

81
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:03,053
You've never left L.A. You pass the bar,
you're gonna be what, a patent lawyer?

82
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:07,390
Probably married to that human Valium,
Richard. I just...

83
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:09,692
Listen, I worry about you, is all.

84
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:26,910
So much potential...

85
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:31,039
and you've resorted to fantasizing
about Conan "Ginger Junk" O'Brien.

86
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,250
- He's funny.
- He looks like a carrot, honey.

87
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:35,051
Who looks like a carrot?

88
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:40,257
Hi. Who looks like a carrot?

89
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:42,467
Conan O'Brien.

90
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,720
My friend Hannah here
thinks he's sexy.

91
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:48,557
That's weird, I think that your friend
Hannah is sexy.

92
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:51,810
Oh, my God. You did not just say that.

93
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,103
How old are you?

94
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:55,564
- What are you, a lawyer?
- Yeah. A little bit.

95
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,190
- Come on.
- I know.

96
00:06:57,191 --> 00:06:59,150
- You are? Is she?
- Gonna be.

97
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,945
Don't you think you're a little old
to use cheesy pickup lines?

98
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:04,990
- Objection. Leading the witness.
- Ha, ha.

99
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,450
You're wearing that
like you're doing it a favor.

100
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:09,244
- Oh, God.
- That's a line.

101
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:13,498
Me sitting there for the past two hours not
being able to take my eyes off you is fact.

102
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,468
I mean, there's lots of beautiful women
in this bar. Your friend included. Hi.

103
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,845
I love you.

104
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:22,841
But I can't take my eyes off of you.
That's a fact, it's not a line.

105
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,018
I find you very attractive.

106
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,595
Do you find me attractive?

107
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:28,930
- She does.
- I don't.

108
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,890
- Tsk. You do. She does.
- Yes, she does.

109
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:32,434
- I don't.
- You do.

110
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:34,227
- You do.
- I don't.

111
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:36,146
- Hannah, can I buy you a drink?
- No.

112
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:37,856
- You say no a lot, don't you?
- No.

113
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,358
Oh, boy. Permission
to approach the bench?

114
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,568
Seriously?

115
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:45,038
Just, come on, let me deliver
my closing argument.

116
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:46,990
Sure. Proceed.

117
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:50,368
- Hannah, we live in a
physical world, right? Uh-huh.

118
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,371
- And you're going to age, right?
- Mm-hm.

119
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,623
I guarantee you this:

120
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:58,460
You're never gonna regret going home with
that guy from the bar that one time...

121
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:00,595
that was a total tomcat in the sack.

122
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:03,506
But I can't guarantee
that you won't not regret it.

123
00:08:03,507 --> 00:08:06,893
- That was a double negative.
- You're a double negative.

124
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:10,055
Okay. Hannah, can I buy you a drink?

125
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,058
Okay. You know what?
It's time to go home.

126
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,267
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

127
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:16,436
That's forward of you, but okay.
I'll do it.

128
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:18,271
I TIVoed Saw III.

129
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:21,358
So should I get my car or yours?
Should I pull the car around?

130
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,859
You been drinking? I'll drive.

131
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,828
- Liz?
- Coming.

132
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,991
- I'll have to call Nanna.
- Huh?

133
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:05,243
Oh. Noth...

134
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:13,584
So Stanford, huh?

135
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,206
Good for you. That's great.
I know your dad's really proud.

136
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:20,883
Yeah. Yeah, he's...

137
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:25,972
- Are you sure you're okay?
- David Lindhagen, God.

138
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:34,772
Okay.

139
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:45,116
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

140
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,535
It's okay.

141
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:49,620
Um...

142
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:53,158
- Mr. Weaver?
- Hmm?

143
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,500
Um...

144
00:09:55,161 --> 00:10:00,882
You're the nicest dad that I babysit...

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,134
Of all the, um...

146
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,844
You're really nice.

147
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,388
- That's very nice.
- And, um...

148
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:12,510
I like Ms. Weaver,
I like her a lot. Okay?

149
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,639
But if she wants to divorce you...

150
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,767
then I think she's batshit crazy.

151
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:19,976
Mm.

152
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:23,946
- Sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

153
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,859
I hope this doesn't make you
uncomfortable.

154
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,029
- I've developed, like, a little crush...
- Could you do me a favor?

155
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,701
Would you not mention to your parents
that Mrs. Weaver and I are, you know...

156
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:40,004
It's something we wanna tell them
on our own, okay?

157
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:42,006
Yeah.

158
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,709
Thank you, I appreciate that.

159
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,135
Have a good night.

160
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,483
See you soon

161
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:08,282
Another vodka cranberry?

162
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,567
I'm sorry. What?

163
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,570
- Another vodka cranberry?
- Oh, yeah. Yes, thanks.

164
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,532
It's no surprise

165
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:18,868
I've been by this place
a million times, never come in.

166
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,703
It's nice, lot of pretty girls.

167
00:11:20,704 --> 00:11:23,122
Nowhere

168
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:25,174
This is my life

169
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:30,380
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

170
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:34,392
My wife is having intercourse
with someone who is not me.

171
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:37,262
Um, I'm sorry to hear that.

172
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:42,733
Oh. Thank you. That is very nice
of you to say. Very, very nice.

173
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:48,197
She just told me. I just found
out, so I'm a little raw. It's...

174
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,491
Ah, okay. Well, you're not listening.

175
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,495
Okay.

176
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:59,208
You wouldn't ignore me
if I were David Lindhagen.

177
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,621
My wife doesn't ignore David Lindhagen.

178
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,882
She screws him.

179
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,093
Screws him.

180
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:13,014
They make this, like, gurgling sound,
it's like:

181
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:18,686
Gay.

182
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:25,768
- Hey, Cal.
- Hey.

183
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:27,695
Hey.

184
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:32,325
Oh, I just, uh... I got the report
on the end-of-year financials.

185
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:35,361
- Good. Good, good. Really great.
- Oh, good.

186
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:37,280
You killed this quarter.

187
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:38,656
Okay.

188
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,541
- Cal, seriously.
- All right.

189
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,578
- Okay.
- Seriously.

190
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:47,173
Who told you
that Emily and I are getting divorced?

191
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,218
- You're getting a divorce?
- Yeah.

192
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:56,758
Amy heard you crying in the bathroom.
We all thought it was cancer.

193
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,135
- Oh.
- Thank God, man. Ha-ha-ha.

194
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:00,770
Yeah, just my relationship.

195
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,683
- Thank God.
- Oh...

196
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,068
Divorce.

197
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:10,521
- I'm so lucky.
- You are.

198
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:14,909
- I have to go pick out furniture now.
- Okay, okay. You go for it.

199
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,789
It could have been cancer, buddy.

200
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,241
Hey, everyone, it's just a divorce.

201
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:23,701
All right, buddy.

202
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,462
Thanks. Feels good.

203
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:46,140
Cal? I just wanted to say...

204
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,942
Shit.

205
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,565
Can I back that thing
out of the driveway for you?

206
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:57,660
- Oh, no. I'll be fine.
- You have trouble in reverse, is all.

207
00:13:58,028 --> 00:14:02,498
When I get settled, the kids can come
and take a look at my new place.

208
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,246
I think I'm having a midlife crisis,
maybe.

209
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,215
Can women have midlife crises?

210
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:15,378
In the movies it's always men having them
and buying ridiculous yellow Porsches...

211
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,088
but, you know, I'm not a man.

212
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,631
Be sure to fertilize all this.

213
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:23,594
We got married so young, Cal.
And now I'm 44.

214
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:26,314
And it's so much older
than I thought I'd be.

215
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:28,975
There's a turnoff valve
for the sprinklers over there.

216
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:31,644
Last week, when I told you
that I had to work late...

217
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:34,488
I went to see the new Twilight movie
by myself.

218
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:37,775
I don't know why I did that.

219
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,777
And it was so bad, Cal.

220
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,072
It keeps raining, you might
wanna turn off the automatic setting.

221
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:46,868
And we haven't been us.
Not for a long time.

222
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:50,163
And I don't know when you and I
stopped being us.

223
00:14:50,164 --> 00:14:52,089
I mean, do you?

224
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:55,051
Maybe it's when
you screwed David Lindhagen.

225
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:23,621
Nobody wants to be alone

226
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:32,088
The heart beats happy
when it has a place

227
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:39,303
And if it doesn't have a home

228
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:47,478
It can come into my space

229
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:52,350
So you can be the one I love

230
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,145
I can be the one you long for

231
00:15:56,146 --> 00:16:00,324
You can be the one I want

232
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:02,693
Hey.

233
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:04,904
Sorry I'm late,
I had to pick something up at Macy's.

234
00:16:04,905 --> 00:16:07,365
- Oh. Don't even worry about it.
- A chardonnay.

235
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,041
I'm just glad you're here.

236
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:12,086
Wow.

237
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:16,549
I don't know. I don't know what
happened. Tough couple of days.

238
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,629
You know
when you don't see something coming...

239
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,382
Claire said I can't be friends
with you anymore.

240
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,883
What?

241
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,719
She said we had to choose
between you and Emily.

242
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,305
I chose you.

243
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:33,691
But she said no.

244
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:39,655
It's cologne.

245
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,492
Bernie?

246
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:48,456
- Are you breaking up with me, Bernie?
- There's a gift receipt in there also.

247
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:50,324
Bernie?

248
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:53,161
Bernie. Bernie.

249
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:57,081
I can be the one you long for

250
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,258
You can be the one

251
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:04,797
You know a word
that is not used very often anymore?

252
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:06,465
"Cuckold."

253
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,259
I'm a cuckold.

254
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,555
David Lindhagen cuckolded me.
He made a cuckold out of me.

255
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:15,099
He slept with my wife.

256
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,684
And I didn't know about it.

257
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:20,479
And that is the
definition of cuckoldom.

258
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,408
David Lindhagen took my wife
and slept with her.

259
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:30,323
Thought I did everything right.
Got married, had kids, the house.

260
00:17:30,324 --> 00:17:33,584
What do I get for it? I get cuckolded.

261
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:38,088
David Lindhagen cuckolded me.
He made a cuckold out of me.

262
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,050
Welcome to my spaceship

263
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,971
It's beautiful forever

264
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,766
Can you give me five minutes?

265
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:53,471
The heart's a lonely hunter

266
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,147
Interesting.

267
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,148
Hey. Jacob Palmer.

268
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,525
- Cal Weaver.
- Let me buy you a drink, Cal.

269
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:09,703
- Thanks, I have a drink.
- Sit. I'd like to buy you a drink.

270
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:11,705
Okay.

271
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,492
Guess what.

272
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,336
- My wife is having an affair with...
- David Lindhagen.

273
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:20,539
David Lindhagen. I know.

274
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,500
- How do I know that?
- I don't know.

275
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,586
I'm a total stranger. How would I know
something so intimate?

276
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:28,097
- Lindhagen screwing with your wife too?
- No.

277
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,892
- Hmm.
- You wanna know why I know that?

278
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:34,303
Okay.

279
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:38,266
It's all that I've heard, Cal, for the
past two nights. It's all anybody's heard.

280
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:43,020
You're going around and you're badgering
people with this sad-sack loser sob story.

281
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,564
- I don't understand why.
- I don't need this crap.

282
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:47,658
- Cal, sit down.
- All right.

283
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:52,196
Look, I know that it sounds harsh,
but it's true.

284
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,283
And you need to hear the truth. Okay?

285
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:56,492
Okay.

286
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:59,453
Cal, would you take that straw
out of your mouth? Please.

287
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:02,081
That looks like
you're sucking on a tiny schwantz.

288
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:05,376
Is that what you want?
Is that the message you wanna send?

289
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,554
- No one's thinking that.
- Really?

290
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:13,217
- So permission to speak candidly, sir.
- Uh, think you've already gone there.

291
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,553
You're sitting there
with a Supercuts haircut...

292
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:19,348
getting drunk on watered-down vodka
cranberries like a 14-year-old girl...

293
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:22,560
and you're wearing a 44 when you
should be wearing a 42 regular.

294
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,904
Honestly, I don't know if I should
help you or euthanize you.

295
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:30,276
Cal, you got a kind face.

296
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:33,370
You got a good head of hair.
You seem like a nice guy.

297
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:38,292
I wanna help you. I'm gonna help you
rediscover your manhood.

298
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:43,756
Do you have any idea,
like, where you lost it?

299
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,259
- A strong case could be made for 1984.
- Well.

300
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:52,056
We're gonna find it.

301
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:55,893
We are. I promise you.

302
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,596
And I promise you this too, Cal:

303
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,639
When we're done...

304
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,150
this wife of yours...

305
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:07,488
she's gonna rue the day
she ever decided to give up on you.

306
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:11,241
That's my offer.

307
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:13,702
You in or you out?

308
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:16,364
Why are you doing this?

309
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:18,248
Maybe you remind me of someone.

310
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:22,252
You in or you out?

311
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,590
I'm in.

312
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:33,555
Hey, fancy face, you wanna go?

313
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:36,634
Okay.

314
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:40,479
Century City Mall, food court,
3:00, Thursday.

315
00:20:42,015 --> 00:20:44,108
After you, hon.

316
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,904
Good night, fancy face.

317
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:55,786
She will rue the day.

318
00:20:56,988 --> 00:21:00,165
Set you guys up with some snacks
over here. TV's already on.

319
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:07,089
You okay?

320
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,508
Mm. Yeah. You?

321
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:11,502
Mm.

322
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,970
Can I tell you something?

323
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:15,806
Love sucks.

324
00:21:20,137 --> 00:21:21,637
Yeah.

325
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:23,556
You in love, buddy?

326
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:26,183
- Well, if you must know...
- Ding-dong.

327
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,727
- Oh, hey, Jess. Thanks for coming by.
- Hey. Yeah.

328
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:30,271
What is she doing here?

329
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:34,859
Guys, I have to step out for a couple
of minutes. Okay? All right? Okay.

330
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,194
Mom wants you to stay
while she's out hooking.

331
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,612
- What?
- What?

332
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:42,158
Oh. Um, the place is nice, Mr. Weaver.

333
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,201
Thanks.
That's a very generous adjective.

334
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,078
- Honey.
- I don't need a babysitter.

335
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,622
She's only four years older.
You need to know that.

336
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:51,709
- She needs to know that.
- I know, I know, I know.

337
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,586
Man, are you growing up.

338
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:56,255
Look at him. It's unbelievable.
He's in love already.

339
00:21:56,256 --> 00:21:57,598
Oh.

340
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,719
Molly. Say bye to Daddy.

341
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,522
- Wait, where are you going?
- I'm taking a class.

342
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:09,310
- That is great, Mr. Weaver.
- Thank you.

343
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:13,564
This is a difficult time for you, right?
And it's important to try new things.

344
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:17,568
Even things that you haven't
considered trying before.

345
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:22,198
Mm-hm. Yup. Molly, I'm going.

346
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:25,159
Okay. That's my princess. Bye. Thanks.

347
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,545
- But wait. Dad.
- Bye, guys. See you in a bit.

348
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,424
Hey, Tiger.

349
00:22:36,213 --> 00:22:38,923
- I love you so, so much.
- Jeez, Robbie.

350
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,099
I love you so much. Please?

351
00:22:43,803 --> 00:22:46,355
What the hell am I doing?

352
00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:49,358
What am I doing?

353
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,354
Hey, uh, everybody.

354
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,689
Everybody. Uh, if I could...

355
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,942
Thank you. A little toast.

356
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:02,120
I would like to thank you all for coming
to Hannah Banana's goodbye party.

357
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,657
And to my...

358
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:06,742
- Hannah Banana.
- Ha, ha.

359
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:09,578
You go into your cave
and you study your butt off.

360
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:15,092
Because if you do, I just know that
you are gonna kick that bar's butt...

361
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:18,796
out of here. You know?
- Yeah.

362
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,549
It reminds me of an old story
my law professor told me...

363
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,926
Oh, dear God. Cheers, everyone.

364
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:26,178
Cheers.

365
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:27,388
Hey, Liz.

366
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:31,900
Listen, when my girl here passes...

367
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:35,563
I'm gonna have another
little celebration right here...

368
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:38,941
and I hope you can make it,
because it's gonna be a special night.

369
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:40,784
Okay.

370
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,992
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

371
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:52,462
- You heard that? "Special night"?
- Yeah. Yeah.

372
00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:55,007
You think he's gonna propose?

373
00:23:56,376 --> 00:23:59,169
At the El Torito Grill?
God, I hope not.

374
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,596
Why, do you want him to?

375
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,008
I don't know, he's nice.

376
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,060
"He's Ni..."? Hannah.

377
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:09,054
He's a sweetheart. Look at him.

378
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:10,647
- He bcc'd you?
- Right, yeah.

379
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:15,227
All right. Hannah, look at you.
Look at you.

380
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:18,522
If you end up with that,
what am I gonna end up with?

381
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,859
- Shut up. Come on.
- That shit's depressing.

382
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,030
All right. You know what? I have to
not big-sister you. It's fine if...

383
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,239
Jesus, really?

384
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,242
No. No. Not my life. Not my life.
I'm going. Okay?

385
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:33,871
So call me if you need anything. Bye.

386
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,497
You're awful. Bye.

387
00:24:35,498 --> 00:24:37,841
Thank you for coming.

388
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:10,582
Um...

389
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,620
- You're late.
- Yeah. Sorry.

390
00:25:14,621 --> 00:25:16,538
- Sbarro's?
- No, thanks.

391
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:19,249
Let me ask a question.
How much you got for clothes?

392
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,459
Um...

393
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,045
- What happened to your feet?
- What do you mean?

394
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:26,048
- These are my 407s.
- Oh, they're 407s.

395
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:27,716
- Can I see them?
- Yeah.

396
00:25:27,717 --> 00:25:29,885
- These offer a lot of support.
- Right.

397
00:25:29,886 --> 00:25:31,687
Whoa. Come on.

398
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:34,431
- What, are you in a fraternity?
- Are you insane?

399
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,558
You could have hit somebody.
What was that?

400
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,894
- I'm asking a question. You in a frat?
- No.

401
00:25:38,895 --> 00:25:40,604
- Are you Steve Jobs?
- What?

402
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,816
Hold on a second. Are you the
billionaire owner of Apple Computers?

403
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:45,109
- No.
- Oh.

404
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,954
Okay. Well, in that case, you got no
right to wear New Balance sneakers ever.

405
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:52,207
- Come on.
- Mm... Oh...

406
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,329
Okay. All right.

407
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,957
One of the best parts
about being a guy your age...

408
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,085
Frankly, there aren't many, so you
should really take full advantage of it.

409
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:04,294
Uh-huh.

410
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:07,464
- Is that you can rebuild your entire
wardrobe with like 16 items.

411
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:08,890
Credit card.

412
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:21,737
What?

413
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:29,570
You see, the problem
is that your head has like...

414
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,955
Like the proportions
of a Styrofoam peanut.

415
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:39,671
The skin under your eyes is starting
to look like Hugh Hefner's ball sac.

416
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,010
It does.

417
00:26:51,384 --> 00:26:52,768
Where are your wallets?

418
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:58,223
- I'm set for jeans.
- You're not set for jeans.

419
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:00,684
- These are fine.
- They're not fine.

420
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,528
- You have a mom butt.
- Why don't we just go to the Gap?

421
00:27:05,982 --> 00:27:08,066
- You know what? They have a s...
- Okay.

422
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,410
What are you doing?

423
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:17,834
Cal, be better than the Gap.

424
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:20,287
Be better than the Gap.

425
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:22,130
Say it.

426
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:25,050
I'm better than the Gap.

427
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,004
- Come on.
- God.

428
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:31,348
- Stop slapping me. Really.
- Okay.

429
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,517
You're beautiful.

430
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:36,762
He likes to slap me in the face.

431
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:38,889
- What are you doing later?
- Ha, ha. I don't know.

432
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,599
- I do.
- Do you?

433
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,601
- I know exactly what you're doing.
- Oh, ha, ha.

434
00:27:42,602 --> 00:27:44,019
Seriously? Seriously?

435
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,729
- You ask her out like that?
- Yeah.

436
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,115
And that worked?

437
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,983
Yeah.

438
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:52,953
Feeling kind of stupid, but...

439
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,614
Wow.

440
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:57,908
Look at you.

441
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,501
Feel like I'm going skiing.

442
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,038
- Would you sleep with him?
- Jesus. God.

443
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,174
- Yeah, probably.
- Wha...?

444
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,418
You would?

445
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:11,555
That's... What?

446
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:15,392
What are you even saying?

447
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,427
You see what just happened, Cal?

448
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:21,223
Soon as you opened your mouth, Tiffany
started doubting whether she wanted to.

449
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:24,351
That's the meanest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

450
00:28:24,352 --> 00:28:26,236
No. This is.

451
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,609
Your wife cheated on you because you
lost sight of who you are as a man...

452
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,321
as a husband, and probably as a lover.

453
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:38,748
You're right, that's meaner.

454
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:43,086
Let's talk about how many women
you've been with.

455
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:46,965
- Sexually?
- Yeah, no. I mean break-dance fighting.

456
00:28:48,877 --> 00:28:50,427
One.

457
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,847
No. Not at one time.

458
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,309
How many total?

459
00:28:59,012 --> 00:29:00,637
Don't say it. Don't say it.

460
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,431
We met in high school, okay?

461
00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:04,858
Oh, boy. You're kidding me.

462
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,269
One woman? That's great.

463
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,146
- Emily is beautiful.
- I guess.

464
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,481
She was gorgeous.
She was one of those women...

465
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:15,402
that could be wildly sexy and
unbelievably cute all at the same time.

466
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:17,195
We had a little blip senior year...

467
00:29:17,196 --> 00:29:19,781
I literally stopped
listening at "Emily."

468
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:22,200
I think we should start approaching
women tonight.

469
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:24,294
Are you ready to go?

470
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:27,172
I miss my wife.

471
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:32,127
- Hi.
- Hi.

472
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:33,962
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

473
00:29:33,963 --> 00:29:36,048
I'm great. I'm Jacob. What's your name?

474
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,767
- Oh. Amy Johnson.
- Amy Johnson.

475
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:42,012
- I'm Jacob Palmer. How you doing?
- Uh, great.

476
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,555
- Good.
- I'm Cal.

477
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:45,182
No. Not yet.

478
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,685
- Sorry. Amy, can I buy you a drink?
- Uh-huh.

479
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:49,937
Keep her company?

480
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:52,697
- I'd be happy to.
- If he gets handsy, let me know.

481
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:56,743
I wouldn't touch you
if my life depended on it.

482
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,784
- Uh, what was your name?
- Cal Weaver.

483
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:06,461
- Cal Weaver.
- No relation to Dennis Weaver.

484
00:30:06,537 --> 00:30:09,748
- Uh... Uh...
- McCloud.

485
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:12,542
McCloud was a show in the '70s
that...

486
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:14,962
You're not talking about McCloud
again, are you?

487
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:18,382
Here we go, huh?
To all of our fallen homeys.

488
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,051
Well, I'm the fourth of five sisters.

489
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,303
- No. That's boring.
- Oh.

490
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:27,057
Not for your sisters, but for my
purposes, it's not gonna work.

491
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:30,185
- Okay.
- I have this friend.

492
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:34,648
And he thinks that you're way too pretty
to be interesting and that's hogwash.

493
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:38,068
- All right. You wanna get out of here?
- Uh, sure.

494
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,361
Giddyup.

495
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:41,822
Am I boring you? I'm
totally boring you. I'm...

496
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:43,448
How are you doing this, like...

497
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:47,244
wildly sexy but unbelievably cute
thing that you're doing?

498
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,204
- Uh...
- It's weird.

499
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:51,415
- You wanna get out of here?
- Yeah.

500
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,709
- Okay.
- Cool.

501
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,087
So Molly, who's 6 at the time,
can't find Mr. Bobo.

502
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,006
We're looking all over.

503
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:02,976
It's in the kitchen. Mr. Bobo was
in the kitchen the whole time.

504
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:05,929
Wanna get out of here?

505
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,939
Have a good night.

506
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:10,684
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

507
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:12,269
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

508
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,438
- Let's get out of here.
- Absolutely.

509
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,699
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

510
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:08,041
Shit.

511
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,748
- You have a second?
- Hey, David. No. Because I'm swamped.

512
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:17,459
- You've been avoiding me.
- No. I haven't.

513
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,213
You ran in the other direction when you
saw me coming down the hall yesterday.

514
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:24,091
- You're very fast, by the way.
- I ran track in high school.

515
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:26,351
That must be it.

516
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:30,388
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
about you and Cal.

517
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:32,516
- No, you're not.
- No, I'm not.

518
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,184
I like you, Emily.

519
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,394
Do you have any idea
how much I like you?

520
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:38,772
Hey, David, you know,
I really have a lot to do.

521
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:41,358
I had no intention of falling
for a married woman...

522
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,653
but all of a sudden we're having
lunch and I'm this accountant...

523
00:32:44,654 --> 00:32:47,364
who's waking up every morning
excited to go to work.

524
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:51,159
And that just does not happen
for accountants. Ever.

525
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,120
I checked with other accountants.

526
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:55,539
David, you know what?
You've been a great friend.

527
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,875
You noticed last month when I got
my hair trimmed and that was huge.

528
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,502
But look, trust me. You know...

529
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:04,256
I am saving you from disaster, because
you're asking to pre-board the Titanic.

530
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:06,299
Do you really want any part of this?

531
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,059
Do I really want any part of this?

532
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:11,771
- Emily? Your report's ready.
- Okay.

533
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:16,601
Okay, people. Here it is.

534
00:33:16,602 --> 00:33:20,564
The Scarlet Letter
by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

535
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:25,660
A romance set in Salem in the 1600s.
It is about sin.

536
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:46,089
Forced to wear the scarlet A
to punish her adulterous behavior.

537
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,760
Dimmesdale's A is inflicted upon
himself in the form of a...

538
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:54,848
Mr. Weaver.

539
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:57,767
Are we interrupting?

540
00:33:57,768 --> 00:34:01,396
You wanna talk about
The Scarlet Letter, Ms. Tafferty?

541
00:34:01,397 --> 00:34:02,814
All right.

542
00:34:02,815 --> 00:34:07,444
Well, the A they're both wearing...

543
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,488
I think it stands for "asshole."

544
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,907
Wanna know why?

545
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:14,242
Because they fell in love...

546
00:34:14,243 --> 00:34:17,245
and love is for stupid assholes.

547
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:19,998
And this book is just about
a bunch of assholes...

548
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,125
who fell in love, like assholes...

549
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:25,136
then had to die, like assholes.

550
00:34:26,672 --> 00:34:29,641
I'm sorry about all the "assholes."

551
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:31,968
You know what else might work?
A swear jar.

552
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,638
You know, a quarter per curse word.

553
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,473
Yeah, we'll definitely try that.

554
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,266
All right. Could help.

555
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:40,693
- Take care.
- Thanks.

556
00:34:44,023 --> 00:34:47,067
- Seriously?
- Sorry.

557
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:50,820
Hey, I have to go back to the office.
You're gonna have to wait for me there.

558
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:52,455
Fine.

559
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:57,293
They're still making kids read
The Scarlet Letter, huh?

560
00:34:57,453 --> 00:34:58,828
Yep.

561
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:02,799
You'd think somebody would have
written something better by now.

562
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,650
I guess I should take that down, huh?

563
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:22,443
I guess.

564
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:31,619
So how is he? You know.

565
00:35:32,488 --> 00:35:35,991
I mean, I... Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Forget it. Just ignore me.

566
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:37,750
- Forget I ever...
- He's out a lot.

567
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:41,204
- A lot?
- Yeah.

568
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,006
Like...

569
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:47,468
Like "a lot" a lot,
or just like a little?

570
00:35:47,753 --> 00:35:49,178
A lot.

571
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:53,850
Well, that's good. That's really good.

572
00:35:58,347 --> 00:36:01,608
- Wanna get takeout tonight, honey?
- I mean, he's sad.

573
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:05,812
I can tell that he's sad.
Even though he looks better...

574
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:12,076
I can still tell that he's not happy,
you know?

575
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:17,582
Yeah. Well, you know. Yeah.

576
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,330
I guess I'm pretty sad too.

577
00:36:23,331 --> 00:36:25,123
I know.

578
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:27,467
I heard you crying the other night.

579
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,211
Didn't know what to do.

580
00:36:30,212 --> 00:36:35,175
Oh, Robbie, baby, you're 13,
you're not supposed to know what to do.

581
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:36,384
I tried Googling it.

582
00:36:36,385 --> 00:36:38,887
- You did not.
- Yep. I did.

583
00:36:38,888 --> 00:36:42,690
- Well, what did you Google?
- I searched "Mom crying in bed."

584
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,393
What did Google say?

585
00:36:45,394 --> 00:36:50,607
Just a bunch of weird videos
of moms in bed.

586
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:53,284
Ugh. Oh, God. Okay.
All right, that's enough. No more.

587
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:56,746
Do those parental controls work at all?

588
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:58,373
They work for me.

589
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:02,669
Because you're a disgusting teenager,
that's why.

590
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:04,954
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

591
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:09,000
- Bill wants to see you before you take off.
- Oh. Uh, David, this is my son, Robbie.

592
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:11,586
Robbie, this is David.

593
00:37:11,587 --> 00:37:15,431
- Um, we work together.
- How you doing, buddy?

594
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,304
- You all right to wait a little bit?
- Yeah.

595
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,315
Okay. Thanks, David.

596
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:41,249
So, Robbie, I hear
you're quite the soccer player.

597
00:37:45,704 --> 00:37:48,631
So, David, I hear
you broke up my parents' marriage.

598
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:53,169
- You are David Lindhagen, right?
- Lindhagen.

599
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,506
- Yeah. Here's the thing, Lindhagen.
- Hagen.

600
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,715
Whatever.

601
00:37:57,716 --> 00:38:00,677
In the end, she winds up
back with my dad.

602
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:04,013
He's a better guy than you are
in every category.

603
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:07,100
And she still loves him.
He's not gonna give up on my mom...

604
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:09,727
like I'm not gonna stop
sending Jessica messages...

605
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:11,813
that make her feel uncomfortable.

606
00:38:11,814 --> 00:38:13,982
Hey. You ready to go, honey?

607
00:38:13,983 --> 00:38:17,910
- Can we order Chinese for dinner tonight?
- Yeah. Sure, honey.

608
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:20,447
Hi, David. Get your stuff.

609
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:22,415
- Bye, David.
- See you.

610
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,876
You're not gonna be able
to feel your arms.

611
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,719
I'll be fine.

612
00:38:35,004 --> 00:38:36,421
Jesus Christ.

613
00:38:36,422 --> 00:38:39,007
Look, let's face it, Cal, all right?

614
00:38:39,008 --> 00:38:43,686
The war between the sexes is over,
and we won, okay?

615
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:48,016
We won the second women started doing
pole dancing for exercise.

616
00:38:48,017 --> 00:38:50,727
But even though we won,
they still deserve our respect.

617
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:54,522
Make them feel beautiful, listen to
their problems, open the door for them.

618
00:38:54,523 --> 00:38:56,483
Would you put on some clothes, please?

619
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:58,943
- I'm sorry, is this bothering you?
- No, it's not.

620
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:02,663
My schwantz is in your face. If it's
not bothering you, we got a problem.

621
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:05,283
- Okay, it bothers me.
- I don't care.

622
00:39:05,284 --> 00:39:08,411
You gotta take control
of your manhood, pal. You know?

623
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,371
You want something, you take it.

624
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:13,249
You don't like something, you say it.
I take what I want.

625
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,085
David Lindhagen certainly took
what he wanted, didn't he?

626
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:17,712
And I can guarantee you this:

627
00:39:17,713 --> 00:39:21,549
He is opening the car door
for your wife right now.

628
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,892
What, you passing out?

629
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:26,854
Oh, boy.

630
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:41,027
- I think you're ready, pal.
- For what?

631
00:39:41,028 --> 00:39:45,323
To talk to a pretty lady, and take
her home and show her your gift.

632
00:39:45,324 --> 00:39:47,033
No. No, I'm not.

633
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:48,952
You're ready as you're ever gonna be.

634
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:52,121
You play your strengths, pal.
That's all any of us can do.

635
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:54,924
I'm mysterious.

636
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,843
I'm, you know, good in bed.

637
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,964
And you are a, uh...

638
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,049
you know, stable and employed adult.

639
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,634
Jesus.

640
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,270
You see this lady over
here at 9 o'clock?

641
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:10,473
You want me to hit on her?

642
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,600
No, I wanna hit on her.
The one behind her.

643
00:40:12,601 --> 00:40:13,810
Oh.

644
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,395
- She's a fox, right?
Mm-hm.

645
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:19,232
You think she came to a crowded bar to
have a quiet drink alone? She's hunting.

646
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:24,529
She's just looking for an opportunity to
settle for a responsible and stable adult.

647
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,322
And I'd like her to settle for you.

648
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,950
Oh. Well, thank you for the ego boost,
but you know what?

649
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:30,868
Just because I've watched you
pick up women...

650
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:32,870
doesn't mean I know how
to pick up women.

651
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:35,957
- Ever see Karate Kid?
- What does that have to do with anything?

652
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,876
When he's teaching him to wax
on and off but really to fight?

653
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:40,336
You want me to fight someone?

654
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:43,214
What's the first thing I do when I
go up to a girl? I buy her a drink.

655
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:46,676
Yes, always. Without fail.
You buy her a drink.

656
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,554
Even if she doesn't want one,
you insist.

657
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:51,639
- And do I talk about myself?
- Never.

658
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,349
Never about yourself, always her.

659
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,351
- Because bar banter?
- Is boring.

660
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,563
So you put the impetus on her.
She has to be the interesting one.

661
00:40:58,564 --> 00:41:01,399
"Impress me. Impress me with
how interesting you are."

662
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,611
It's a big game. Game.
Creepy, creepy little game you play.

663
00:41:04,612 --> 00:41:06,362
- That's judgmental, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.

664
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,656
At the end of the night
do I ask them to come home?

665
00:41:08,657 --> 00:41:11,951
No, you tell them to come home.
They have no choice in the matter.

666
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:16,589
It is your choice and they are so
overjoyed to have had the opportunity...

667
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:20,927
to make sweet, sweet love to you.

668
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:22,929
Oh, my God.

669
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:25,431
You did, you Miyagi'd me.

670
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,133
Honk.

671
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:29,143
Take your ring off. Let's go.

672
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:38,770
Just no talking about your kids, your
job, David Lindhagen, don't you dare.

673
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:40,480
Shut up, shut up. Just shut up.

674
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:41,689
- Hello.
- Hi.

675
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,066
Hi. Hi.

676
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,401
- Who are you?
- Hey. I'm Kate.

677
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,537
- Kate, you mind if I introduce you to my...?
- I'm Cal.

678
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:50,782
- I got this. Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

679
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:53,584
And this is my friend Jacob.
He was just leaving.

680
00:41:53,786 --> 00:41:55,662
- Oh.
- Oh.

681
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:58,547
So that's one way to treat people.

682
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,921
So can I buy you a drink, Kate?

683
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:08,557
- Oh. No, thank you.
- I'm gonna buy you a drink anyway.

684
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,679
Grey Goose, right?

685
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,439
Rocks. Two limes?

686
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:16,983
I'm five years sober.

687
00:42:17,726 --> 00:42:20,228
- What can I get for you?
- Nothing. Nothing.

688
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:22,947
Go away, we're good.
Please don't come back ever.

689
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:29,829
- Ahem. So, what do you do, Cal?
- I don't know. What do you do, Kate?

690
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:32,248
- I asked you first.
- I asked you second.

691
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:37,962
Seriously, what do you do?

692
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,333
Are you really not going to tell me
what you do?

693
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:44,176
Ah...

694
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:48,723
- Uh, okay, I'm a teacher.
- Boring.

695
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,552
Come on, you gotta keep it interesting.
Interest me.

696
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:54,011
Uh...

697
00:42:54,012 --> 00:42:57,098
- I studied at Oxford for five years.
- Boring!

698
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:01,310
Wow. Teacher with an alcohol dependency
who studied at Oxford.

699
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:04,021
Blah, blah, blah. Bleh.

700
00:43:04,022 --> 00:43:05,398
England. Yuck.

701
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:07,191
I think my friends just got here.

702
00:43:07,192 --> 00:43:09,902
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

703
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:12,739
- Okay, I'm in corporate insurance.
- Oh, God.

704
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,282
I have children, plural.

705
00:43:14,283 --> 00:43:16,584
My wife was cheating on me
with Lindhagen...

706
00:43:16,744 --> 00:43:19,746
which I wasn't supposed to tell you.
Nice to meet you.

707
00:43:19,747 --> 00:43:22,832
- What were you supposed to tell me?
- I don't know. I don't know.

708
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:27,003
I was supposed to say that you are the
perfect combination of sexy and cute...

709
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:30,131
which is actually something
that I used to say to my wife.

710
00:43:30,132 --> 00:43:32,467
But now it's become corrupted.

711
00:43:32,468 --> 00:43:35,595
And I have 18 layers of clothes on.

712
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:39,015
I'm wearing a shirt and a tie
and a sweater and a suede jacket...

713
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,350
that just seals in all the heat.

714
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:43,102
Seals in all the juices.

715
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:47,982
It's all sweat under here.
This is just sweat from here down.

716
00:43:47,983 --> 00:43:52,820
This sweater, this is called slim cut,
but it feels like a scuba suit.

717
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:55,498
And I'm looking at your breasts.
What's that about?

718
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:59,285
You think I'm the perfect combination
of sexy and cute?

719
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:01,704
That's what you picked up
from what I just said?

720
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,714
Mm, mm.

721
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,588
- So this is my crappy apartment.
- Oh. Ooh.

722
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:14,050
Dumpy. That I had to move into
after my wife left me.

723
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,885
I love how you're being so honest.

724
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,521
- You like that?
- It's so different. It's so hot.

725
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:20,723
Okay. Okay.

726
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,517
- Aah! Ha, ha.
- Wow! Wow!

727
00:44:22,518 --> 00:44:24,060
- More.
- Okay.

728
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,937
- Wanna hear something really hot?
- Mm-hm.

729
00:44:25,938 --> 00:44:29,148
I've only had sex with one woman.
In my entire life.

730
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:31,009
- Honest or not honest?
- That's honest.

731
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,779
More! Tell me more.

732
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,164
I'm a little worried you have AIDS.

733
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:42,245
Just a little. Just a little bit.

734
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:45,256
It's okay, I'm not worried.

735
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,010
Oh, my God, this is so much fun.

736
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,389
What do you wanna do with me?

737
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:55,091
Oh...

738
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,394
I wanna show you off to my ex-wife
and make her really jealous.

739
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:03,307
Whoa, man.

740
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:06,110
Phew. Ha, ha.

741
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,523
You gonna call me?

742
00:45:10,524 --> 00:45:11,732
Okay.

743
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:13,075
Yeah.

744
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,792
Wow, that is a great dress.
Where'd you get that?

745
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,086
Thank you. A store in Beverly Hills.

746
00:45:32,087 --> 00:45:33,671
Really? Beautiful.

747
00:45:33,672 --> 00:45:35,464
It was a gift from my grandmother.

748
00:45:35,465 --> 00:45:36,924
- Really?
- It's a Krugerrand.

749
00:45:36,925 --> 00:45:38,259
It's from South Africa.

750
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,102
I love it.

751
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,610
And I told him never to assume
anything.

752
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:52,356
And I've been to Maine, so that's a sixth
state. So I've been to six states.

753
00:45:52,357 --> 00:45:54,984
- Oh, I love Maine.
- Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.

754
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,453
- Have you been to Waterville?
- I have, yeah.

755
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,785
Greece, Italy.

756
00:46:04,786 --> 00:46:06,162
Greece, Italy?

757
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:07,496
Wanna get out of here?

758
00:46:07,497 --> 00:46:09,215
- You're driving.
- I am.

759
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:23,103
I have never experienced that
in my life.

760
00:46:23,388 --> 00:46:26,307
- Pretty great.
- Are most women like that these days?

761
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:28,809
- God bless technology.
- God bless it.

762
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:33,022
I went and met this girl the other night.
She was heckling me the whole time we...

763
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,442
I felt like I was doing it with the two
old guys from The Muppet Show.

764
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:39,111
- Ha-ha-ha. Statler and Waldorf.
- I was into it.

765
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:43,074
And she was like, "Look at this frown
on your face. What is that?

766
00:46:43,075 --> 00:46:46,494
You're so serious. What, it's serious
to kiss me? It's supposed to be fun.

767
00:46:46,495 --> 00:46:49,355
Oh, my God, if it's gonna be hard work,
why don't you just stop?"

768
00:46:55,128 --> 00:46:56,337
Hello?

769
00:46:56,338 --> 00:46:58,965
Hey. Hot guy from the bar
who hit on you is here.

770
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:00,549
Tsk. Liz, I'm studying.

771
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:03,844
You should be studying the ceiling
of his bedroom.

772
00:47:03,845 --> 00:47:05,471
I am eating a caramel apple.

773
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:08,432
In what world, honey?
Please, turn around. No.

774
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:11,477
Come on, take a break.
It'll be good for you to get out.

775
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:12,687
And by get out...

776
00:47:12,688 --> 00:47:16,865
I mean have hot guy from the bar knock you
into his headboard until you see God.

777
00:47:17,025 --> 00:47:18,359
What is wrong with you?

778
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,236
You should be studying the curve
of his...

779
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,612
Okay, goodbye, Liz.

780
00:47:21,613 --> 00:47:24,039
That too much? Hello?

781
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:27,743
Look, I gave him the cologne
like you told me to...

782
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:30,830
and I don't think we should really
just dance on his grave.

783
00:47:30,831 --> 00:47:34,967
I just thought you'd wanna know
what I heard about your old pal Cal.

784
00:47:35,502 --> 00:47:37,670
What about Mr. Weaver, Mom?

785
00:47:37,671 --> 00:47:43,718
Um, just, apparently, Mr. Weaver
has become a real ladies' man.

786
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:45,386
- What?
- Claire.

787
00:47:45,387 --> 00:47:48,305
She should know. She babysits for him.

788
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:52,351
She's almost an adult. Lots of young
women in and out of his apartment.

789
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:53,769
She's too young for this.

790
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,397
I don't like this S-E-X talk in front
of the K-I-D-S.

791
00:47:56,398 --> 00:47:59,692
First of all, they can spell.
Second of all, I'm just saying.

792
00:47:59,693 --> 00:48:01,869
I think we were right
in choosing Emily.

793
00:48:21,882 --> 00:48:24,050
- Oh, um...
- Why are you following me?

794
00:48:24,051 --> 00:48:26,802
Madison, I just had a question for you.

795
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,637
Okay, Jessica, what's up?

796
00:48:28,638 --> 00:48:30,431
It's kind of on the personal side.

797
00:48:30,432 --> 00:48:31,774
Yep, my lips are:

798
00:48:36,438 --> 00:48:38,489
Seals. My lips are seals.

799
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,651
Okay. Um...

800
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:46,989
My question, and I don't mean to be blunt or
insulting, but let's just call it what it is.

801
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,283
You're always sleeping
with older guys, right?

802
00:48:49,284 --> 00:48:51,577
- Always.
- Oh, um...

803
00:48:51,578 --> 00:48:56,082
So my question for you, Madison,
is, um, how do you do that?

804
00:48:56,083 --> 00:49:00,002
I mean, how do you get them to see you as
not just a kid in high school, you know?

805
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,671
But as someone that's mature,
and old, and that's...

806
00:49:02,672 --> 00:49:05,591
Well, first off, I have a huge rack.

807
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:07,093
Uh, yes, you do.

808
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:08,936
You don't have a huge rack.

809
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:10,638
No.

810
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:13,273
- Wait, how old is he?
- Old.

811
00:49:13,725 --> 00:49:15,609
Like really old?

812
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:19,647
- Like parent-old.
- Nasty, Jessica.

813
00:49:19,648 --> 00:49:22,024
Yeah, because
that's what I was thinking, right?

814
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,651
- Rock on.
- Thank you.

815
00:49:23,652 --> 00:49:26,946
- You are so dirty.
- Yes, I know.

816
00:49:26,947 --> 00:49:29,031
Oh, okay. You gotta force his hand.

817
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,407
You know what I mean?

818
00:49:30,408 --> 00:49:32,209
Go TMZ on his ass.

819
00:49:32,953 --> 00:49:35,454
- Not following.
- A dirty picture.

820
00:49:35,455 --> 00:49:38,340
- Oh. Oh.
- Make this face:

821
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:42,336
- Jeez, Madison. Stop.
- What?

822
00:49:42,337 --> 00:49:48,058
You put that on his radar and he won't see you
as a little girl anymore, that's for sure.

823
00:50:02,816 --> 00:50:06,952
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey. We don't know.

824
00:50:19,207 --> 00:50:20,666
Behold.

825
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:23,460
Jessica Riley, you are my soul mate.

826
00:50:23,461 --> 00:50:25,462
- The love of my life.
Ha-ha-ha.

827
00:50:25,463 --> 00:50:29,049
I have marked myself with a scarlet J
for you, Jessica.

828
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,467
Get down from there.

829
00:50:30,468 --> 00:50:35,264
- Nathaniel Hawthorne... Are you mad?
- I am your babysitter. You get down.

830
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,232
Oh, my God.

831
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:39,727
- What are you thinking?
- Like the scaffold?

832
00:50:39,728 --> 00:50:42,396
Took me like four weeks to make it.
It has wheels.

833
00:50:42,397 --> 00:50:44,356
This has got to stop, Robbie.

834
00:50:44,357 --> 00:50:47,276
- You'll learn to love me, I promise.
- No, I won't.

835
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:50,662
- Because I'm four years younger?
- Because I love somebody else.

836
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:53,699
Who is he?

837
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,250
He's older.

838
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,670
And I didn't want my
parents to find out.

839
00:51:00,248 --> 00:51:02,458
You know I'll kill him if he hurts you.

840
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,718
Yeah, I know.

841
00:51:05,378 --> 00:51:07,554
Okay, Robbie, this has to stop.

842
00:51:07,672 --> 00:51:09,890
Okay? No more.

843
00:51:11,176 --> 00:51:12,635
Grow up.

844
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:14,102
I'll see you around.

845
00:52:12,988 --> 00:52:14,329
Okay.

846
00:52:58,533 --> 00:53:01,785
So you're seeing Mom tomorrow
at my parent-teacher thing.

847
00:53:01,786 --> 00:53:03,837
Yeah, no biggie.

848
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,219
What's with all the moping?

849
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:14,723
Uh, nothing. It's just...

850
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,309
There's a girl.

851
00:53:18,553 --> 00:53:20,888
- A girl, huh?
- Uh-huh.

852
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:22,314
You like her?

853
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,517
I like Pringles.

854
00:53:25,518 --> 00:53:27,527
I mean, this girl...

855
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:29,396
she's incredible.

856
00:53:29,397 --> 00:53:31,648
She's my soul mate, you know?

857
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:33,533
She doesn't even care.

858
00:53:33,693 --> 00:53:35,869
But she's your soul mate, right?

859
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:37,871
Yeah.

860
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,457
Well, you just don't give up on her,
right?

861
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,752
Why not? You did.

862
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:47,464
I didn't give up.

863
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:52,336
Okay, it's more complicated than that.

864
00:53:52,337 --> 00:53:53,762
I'm a different guy now.

865
00:53:54,172 --> 00:53:56,632
You're not different.
You just have different clothes.

866
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,133
It's not that simple, kiddo.

867
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,219
- What kind of crap is that?
- Watch it.

868
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,354
You love her or you don't.
I know you do.

869
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:07,476
I'm serious, Dad. I just need some
inspiration right now. All right?

870
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,277
Go get her back.

871
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:15,409
Wow, how old are you?

872
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,762
Wow.

873
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:46,106
You look great, Cal.

874
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,393
Oh. Ha, ha.

875
00:54:49,394 --> 00:54:54,106
Well, it turns out I've been buying the
wrong size suit for like 20 years, so...

876
00:54:54,107 --> 00:54:57,951
Oh, well, whatever.
You, um... You look great.

877
00:54:58,027 --> 00:55:00,028
Thanks. You always look great.

878
00:55:00,029 --> 00:55:01,663
Oh, thanks.

879
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:20,048
- So I spoke to Nanna yesterday.
- Yeah, me too. How'd she sound to you?

880
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:24,269
Um... Like Nanna. She worries about us.

881
00:55:27,015 --> 00:55:28,223
What teacher is this?

882
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:31,643
Ms. Tafferty. She's the one he pulled
the Scarlet Letter asshole routine on.

883
00:55:31,644 --> 00:55:34,062
Mm-hm.

884
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:35,906
God, he's such a weird kid.

885
00:55:36,816 --> 00:55:38,358
- I kind of like him, though.
- Mm-hm.

886
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:40,986
Yeah, me too. Glad we switched
babies at the hospital.

887
00:55:40,987 --> 00:55:44,080
Me too. That other one's
in jail, probably.

888
00:55:54,334 --> 00:55:56,335
So how's it going with David?

889
00:55:56,336 --> 00:55:59,513
Oh, you know, it, um...

890
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,140
It wasn't, um...

891
00:56:03,343 --> 00:56:06,637
That didn't mean anything.

892
00:56:06,638 --> 00:56:09,189
- I mean, you know, if...
- No. No, I know.

893
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,278
You seeing anybody?

894
00:56:15,563 --> 00:56:16,855
Me?

895
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:18,941
Mm-mm.

896
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:22,035
Oh, you know. Well, you hear things,
you know, so...

897
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:24,696
No. No. Not real...

898
00:56:24,697 --> 00:56:26,414
You know me.

899
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:29,626
Yeah, well...

900
00:56:32,747 --> 00:56:34,214
No.

901
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,098
I miss you, Em.

902
00:56:46,427 --> 00:56:49,563
I made an effort when we were younger,
didn't I?

903
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:54,393
I mean, miniature golf and dancing.
You were such a great dancer.

904
00:56:54,394 --> 00:56:57,487
I had to be.
You were such a good miniature golfer.

905
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:02,367
I just... I don't know.
I guess I got lazy. I got...

906
00:57:03,278 --> 00:57:05,821
I got boring, is what I got.

907
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,205
No.

908
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,916
And I'm so mad at you.

909
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,836
I'm really mad at you for what you did.

910
00:57:13,288 --> 00:57:15,338
But I'm mad at myself too.

911
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:23,346
Because I should not have jumped out of
that car. I should've fought for you.

912
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,352
Because you fight for your soul mates.

913
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,648
Least, that's what my 13-year-old son
tells me.

914
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,226
He's a really strange kid.

915
00:57:36,227 --> 00:57:38,028
He scares the shit out of me.

916
00:57:40,064 --> 00:57:42,824
I miss you too.

917
00:57:45,987 --> 00:57:47,662
Mr. And Mrs. Weaver?

918
00:57:48,656 --> 00:57:51,499
No way in hell.

919
00:57:51,743 --> 00:57:55,746
- Cal, what are you doing here?
- Oh, you two know each other?

920
00:57:55,747 --> 00:57:59,341
Yes. Yeah, right. We've
met before, yes.

921
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:03,211
- "We have met before"? Seriously?
Mm-hm.

922
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:06,381
So I'd like to introduce you
to my wife, Emily.

923
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,642
Hi, I'm Robbie's mom.

924
00:58:09,636 --> 00:58:13,021
She's your wife again. How convenient.

925
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,976
So shall we enter?

926
00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:19,603
- Okay.
- Why don't we?

927
00:58:19,604 --> 00:58:21,696
Yeah, let's do that.

928
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:28,862
I'm sorry. I'm playing catch-up. How
do you two know each other, exactly?

929
00:58:28,863 --> 00:58:32,123
- Um...
- Um...

930
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:35,293
Maybe your husband should tell you.

931
00:58:35,953 --> 00:58:42,926
We... I think we met at last year's
parent-teacher conference, wasn't it?

932
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,424
Did I miss it? Did I miss the
parent-teacher conference thing last year?

933
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,927
Yeah. I don't remember.

934
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,221
Why don't we just, uh, focus on Robbie?

935
00:58:54,222 --> 00:58:55,889
Yes.

936
00:58:55,890 --> 00:59:00,235
Yes, let's do that. Let's...

937
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,405
Let's focus on Robbie.

938
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,780
As you know,
Robbie's shining moment...

939
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:15,917
was when he set a school record for
cursing in an eighth-grade English class.

940
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,917
Asshole. Ha-ha-ha.

941
00:59:23,918 --> 00:59:26,253
You're familiar with this word,
Mrs. Weaver.

942
00:59:26,254 --> 00:59:28,672
Yes, I am. And I've
spoken to Principal...

943
00:59:28,673 --> 00:59:32,300
Asshole. As in someone who tells
a woman that he'll call and never does.

944
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:33,468
Hmm.

945
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:36,596
Asshole. As in someone who uses honesty
to get a woman into bed with him...

946
00:59:36,597 --> 00:59:39,274
but is actually full of shit
like the rest of them.

947
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:41,852
- This is not about Robbie.
- Mm-mm.

948
00:59:41,853 --> 00:59:46,815
Asshole. As in someone who allows a
woman to go downtown for 45 minutes...

949
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:48,442
because he's nervous.

950
00:59:48,443 --> 00:59:50,652
- All right, all right, all right.
- Ew. Ew. Oh.

951
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,195
You know what? Know what? No.

952
00:59:52,196 --> 00:59:53,997
Here's the deal.

953
00:59:57,618 --> 00:59:59,536
- She's an alcoholic.
- Aah!

954
00:59:59,537 --> 01:00:01,788
- Oh, God. Okay.
- That's... I'm sorry.

955
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:03,457
- I'm sorry. God.
- I gotta go.

956
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:05,425
- Aah!
- Oh, my God. Emily. God.

957
01:00:05,918 --> 01:00:08,795
- Emily, Emily, wait.
- Leave me alone, Cal.

958
01:00:08,796 --> 01:00:13,725
I'm sober five years, asshole!

959
01:00:14,802 --> 01:00:17,387
Okay, yeah, I did. I did.

960
01:00:17,388 --> 01:00:20,557
I slept with our son's eighth-grade
English teacher.

961
01:00:20,558 --> 01:00:22,100
I know. I know.

962
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:25,562
And I cheated,
so I have no right to be angry.

963
01:00:25,563 --> 01:00:28,607
Not the point. When we were
married you were the only woman...

964
01:00:28,608 --> 01:00:30,233
that I had ever slept with...

965
01:00:30,234 --> 01:00:33,411
and now I have had sex
with nine different women... God.

966
01:00:35,156 --> 01:00:38,541
Nine?

967
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,212
Wow.

968
01:00:45,082 --> 01:00:47,592
You showed me.

969
01:00:52,256 --> 01:00:54,766
I wasn't trying to show you.

970
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,852
I was trying to move on.

971
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,857
But I don't want to.

972
01:01:08,189 --> 01:01:10,740
You've always been the only one.

973
01:01:13,486 --> 01:01:17,580
Tell her she's the perfect combination
of sexy and cute, asshole.

974
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:24,379
You said that to her?

975
01:01:30,336 --> 01:01:32,512
I did, yes.

976
01:01:33,464 --> 01:01:35,557
Who are you?

977
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,941
I'm your soul mate.

978
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:03,209
What a cliché.

979
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:41,289
You, get over here. Come on.

980
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,491
Yeah, yeah, give it up.
Give it up for her.

981
01:02:43,492 --> 01:02:45,035
Aw.

982
01:02:45,036 --> 01:02:46,661
I'm so proud of you, baby.

983
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:48,671
I had my doubts, of course.

984
01:02:53,544 --> 01:02:58,973
Hannah, I did tell you that tonight would
be a special night if you passed the bar.

985
01:03:00,051 --> 01:03:01,392
So, Hannah...

986
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:07,682
I would like to formally ask you...

987
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:10,193
in front of all our friends
and colleagues...

988
01:03:10,436 --> 01:03:14,364
if you would like to become...

989
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:18,902
a permanent lawyer at the firm
of Watkins, Goldberg and Schmidt? Huh?

990
01:03:18,903 --> 01:03:21,663
How about that? Ha, ha. To you.

991
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:23,665
Whoo!

992
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:30,046
What?

993
01:03:30,623 --> 01:03:33,841
- I ju... Um...
- What, what is it?

994
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:41,391
I thought that you were gonna propose
for some reason.

995
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:45,345
- What?
- Yeah. I know. I'm just...

996
01:03:45,346 --> 01:03:47,055
It's just, uh, I'm a little thrown.

997
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:48,564
I'm sorry.

998
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:54,562
I didn't realize that you thought
that we were there.

999
01:03:54,563 --> 01:03:58,024
Oh, no. God, no. Don't be silly.
I just...

1000
01:03:58,025 --> 01:04:00,819
I need some time, I think...

1001
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:05,832
to figure out how I feel about us,
you know?

1002
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:09,752
Brrp. Long-term.

1003
01:04:11,122 --> 01:04:13,464
You need some time?

1004
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:17,335
You need some time to figure out
how you feel about us? Okay.

1005
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:18,678
Honey?

1006
01:04:22,299 --> 01:04:25,560
- Wow. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha, ha. Wow.

1007
01:04:26,345 --> 01:04:29,514
- Ahem.
- Wow. Huh.

1008
01:04:29,515 --> 01:04:30,857
Wow.

1009
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,978
This is actually really funny.
I'm just... Next level.

1010
01:04:34,979 --> 01:04:36,904
- Is this yours? Is this yours?
- Yes.

1011
01:04:37,606 --> 01:04:40,025
Mm. Mm.

1012
01:04:40,026 --> 01:04:41,492
Honey?

1013
01:04:42,153 --> 01:04:44,120
- Is this gin?
- Yes.

1014
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,624
- There's, like, no water in that.
- Yeah.

1015
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:52,503
- Great.
- Mm. Aah, I hate gin.

1016
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:55,040
Wow, you know what?
Thank you, Richard.

1017
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:59,677
Honestly, thank you very much
for your job offer. I will consider it.

1018
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:01,429
Hannah Banana.

1019
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,807
- Whoo! Ha, ha.
- Banana. Hannah.

1020
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,516
- Do you wanna buy me a drink?
- Yes.

1021
01:05:13,517 --> 01:05:16,277
- It's nicer that way. Right?
- You.

1022
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,304
You remember me?

1023
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,548
Yeah.

1024
01:05:45,549 --> 01:05:47,884
- You still find me attractive?
- Yes.

1025
01:05:47,885 --> 01:05:49,894
Still wanna take me home?

1026
01:05:51,055 --> 01:05:52,397
Yeah.

1027
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,192
Let's go.

1028
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,270
Just one look

1029
01:06:33,722 --> 01:06:36,224
And I fell so hard

1030
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:37,692
Here.

1031
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:42,063
I really like this song.
This was a good choice. Yeah.

1032
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:44,566
- Good song. You never hear this song.
- Mm-hm. Mm-mm.

1033
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:45,908
Love this song.

1034
01:06:48,654 --> 01:06:50,121
Cheers.

1035
01:06:51,824 --> 01:06:57,287
How good it feels

1036
01:06:57,288 --> 01:06:58,754
Ugh.

1037
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:01,749
That's not my drink.

1038
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,626
Your love

1039
01:07:03,627 --> 01:07:06,137
Mm. Mm.

1040
01:07:06,755 --> 01:07:08,097
Ugh.

1041
01:07:10,217 --> 01:07:12,727
It's not my favorite. Thank you.

1042
01:07:14,638 --> 01:07:16,731
Forever

1043
01:07:18,475 --> 01:07:21,978
And always

1044
01:07:21,979 --> 01:07:25,106
- So is this how it normally works?
- What?

1045
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,942
You put on the perfect song,
you make them a drink.

1046
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:31,446
And I knew

1047
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:33,072
And then you sleep together.

1048
01:07:33,073 --> 01:07:34,665
That you

1049
01:07:35,492 --> 01:07:37,202
Um...

1050
01:07:37,203 --> 01:07:38,544
Yeah.

1051
01:07:40,206 --> 01:07:42,131
I'm very nervous.

1052
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:44,383
I'm getting that.

1053
01:07:44,668 --> 01:07:47,545
Okay. Because I know I seemed confident
back at the bar...

1054
01:07:47,546 --> 01:07:52,133
but that was mostly just
because I was cold and wet...

1055
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:54,936
and trying to be dramatic
a little bit.

1056
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:56,812
You're adorable.

1057
01:07:57,681 --> 01:07:59,023
No.

1058
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:00,516
I am sexy.

1059
01:08:00,517 --> 01:08:02,810
- I am R-rated sexy.
- Mm-hm.

1060
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:06,439
Okay, I know what happens in the PG-13
version of tonight, all right? I know.

1061
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,735
It's that I get really drunk
and then I pass out.

1062
01:08:10,736 --> 01:08:13,988
You cover me with a blanket,
kiss me on the cheek, nothing happens.

1063
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,457
But that's not why I'm here.

1064
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:21,504
I am here to bang the hot guy
that hit on me at the bar.

1065
01:08:22,831 --> 01:08:25,132
- Jacob.
- Jacob.

1066
01:08:26,126 --> 01:08:28,253
- Are people still saying "bang"?
- I do.

1067
01:08:28,254 --> 01:08:30,755
We are gonna bang. Hmm?

1068
01:08:30,756 --> 01:08:32,431
This is happening.

1069
01:08:32,883 --> 01:08:34,550
- Take off your shirt.
- Why?

1070
01:08:34,551 --> 01:08:38,346
Please, will you take off your shirt? I
can't stop thinking. I need to just...

1071
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:40,898
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right, okay, okay, okay.

1072
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,358
Fuck.

1073
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:53,661
Seriously? It's like
you're Photoshopped.

1074
01:08:55,447 --> 01:08:56,831
Can I...?

1075
01:08:57,574 --> 01:08:59,834
Aah. You have cold hands.

1076
01:09:00,953 --> 01:09:02,662
- Now you take off your dress.
- No.

1077
01:09:02,663 --> 01:09:05,665
- Yes.
- No. Not with that going on. No, thank you.

1078
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:08,467
Is there dim lighting somewhere?
Oh, God.

1079
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:12,964
Okay, so then what do we do?
What happens now? Like, logistically?

1080
01:09:12,965 --> 01:09:16,050
- What's your move?
- What do you mean, what's my move?

1081
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:18,845
- What's your move? Your big move?
- I got lots of moves.

1082
01:09:18,846 --> 01:09:20,847
- What's your big move?
- I'm not telling.

1083
01:09:20,848 --> 01:09:23,558
- Tell me your move.
- You're not ready for the big move.

1084
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,935
- Yes, I am.
- You can't handle the big move.

1085
01:09:25,936 --> 01:09:29,614
- Tell me your big move.
- I work Dirty Dancing into the conversation.

1086
01:09:31,317 --> 01:09:33,359
Dirty Dancing?

1087
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,611
- Can I sit down, please?
- Yeah.

1088
01:09:35,612 --> 01:09:37,530
- Can I put back on my shirt?
- No.

1089
01:09:37,531 --> 01:09:40,033
Why Dirty Dancing? What do we do?
Do we watch it?

1090
01:09:40,034 --> 01:09:44,412
You know the big move at the end where
Patrick Swayze picks up Jennifer Grey?

1091
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,589
- Yeah.
- I can do that.

1092
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:50,376
- Okay.
- So I tell girls I can do the move.

1093
01:09:50,377 --> 01:09:54,388
I put on the song "Time of Your Life."
I do the big move.

1094
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:56,716
And they always wanna have sex
with me.

1095
01:09:56,717 --> 01:09:59,886
Oh, my God. That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

1096
01:09:59,887 --> 01:10:02,438
I agree. But it works every time.

1097
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:04,690
That would not work on me.

1098
01:10:10,147 --> 01:10:13,024
Oh, God, this is ridiculous.
I don't wanna do it.

1099
01:10:13,025 --> 01:10:14,233
Come on.

1100
01:10:14,234 --> 01:10:16,277
This is beyond ridiculous.

1101
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,945
- Run and jump.
- No.

1102
01:10:17,946 --> 01:10:19,914
- Yeah. Come on.
- No, thank you.

1103
01:10:20,824 --> 01:10:22,917
Thank God I'm drunk. Here we go.

1104
01:10:26,663 --> 01:10:33,252
'Cause I've had the time of my life

1105
01:10:33,253 --> 01:10:38,099
And I owe it all to you

1106
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,307
I've been waiting for so long

1107
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:51,153
Now I've finally found someone
To stand by me

1108
01:10:53,607 --> 01:10:56,401
Ahem. So do you prefer to do it here
or in the bedroom?

1109
01:10:56,402 --> 01:10:57,735
The bedroom is preferred.

1110
01:10:57,736 --> 01:11:00,788
Mm-hm. Yeah, okay. Let's go there.

1111
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:35,531
This pillow...

1112
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:40,286
forms perfectly
to the shape of my head.

1113
01:11:42,281 --> 01:11:43,748
Yeah.

1114
01:11:48,328 --> 01:11:51,213
Is this one of those foam pillows
from Brookstone?

1115
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:53,674
Yeah.

1116
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:56,177
- Yeah? Oh.
- Yeah.

1117
01:11:56,837 --> 01:11:59,764
I always wondered
who buys those kind of...

1118
01:11:59,965 --> 01:12:03,217
The hot guy from the bar buys these.
Of course.

1119
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,886
- Jacob.
- Mm-hm, Jacob. Sorry about that.

1120
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,228
Good.

1121
01:12:07,139 --> 01:12:09,315
I'm sorry, continue.

1122
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:33,506
You don't have one of those ridiculous,
um, massage chairs, do you?

1123
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,128
- You do?
- No.

1124
01:12:39,129 --> 01:12:40,922
- Yes, you do.
- Yeah, I do.

1125
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:43,633
- Ha-ha-ha. Oh, my God.
- I don't. I don't. I do.

1126
01:12:43,634 --> 01:12:46,060
Who would have that?
I would. I have that.

1127
01:12:46,178 --> 01:12:48,158
- How much was it?
- Five thousand dollars.

1128
01:12:49,515 --> 01:12:51,307
Ask me how many times I've used it.

1129
01:12:51,308 --> 01:12:53,776
- How many times have you used it?
- Twice.

1130
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,145
That's $2500 a massage.

1131
01:12:56,146 --> 01:12:58,072
Twice.

1132
01:12:58,106 --> 01:13:01,575
- Where is it?
- It's in the garage.

1133
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:03,869
Can I sit in the massage chair?

1134
01:13:08,408 --> 01:13:10,209
I hate it.

1135
01:13:10,994 --> 01:13:14,622
The Home Shopping Network. But I'm
addic... I buy... I'm just the worst.

1136
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,290
- Do you have a Slap Chop?
- Yes.

1137
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,459
- The knife that cuts through the penny?
- Yes.

1138
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:21,462
- Ha-ha-ha. What else do you have?
- Coin Bears.

1139
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:23,965
Coin Bears?
You don't have Coin Bears.

1140
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,925
I have a whole set from each state.

1141
01:13:25,926 --> 01:13:27,510
You have 50 Coin Bears?

1142
01:13:27,511 --> 01:13:30,137
- They have a coin in their foot.
- You stay up nights.

1143
01:13:30,138 --> 01:13:32,022
I am wildly unhappy.

1144
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:36,852
I'm trying to buy it,
and it's not working.

1145
01:13:36,853 --> 01:13:39,355
- Were you smart in school?
- A little bossy, yeah.

1146
01:13:39,356 --> 01:13:44,110
But I won a spelling bee
and my dad cried at the spelling bee.

1147
01:13:44,111 --> 01:13:46,153
- No way. That's nice.
- Mm-hm.

1148
01:13:46,154 --> 01:13:48,406
- What word did you win on?
- It was so stupid.

1149
01:13:48,407 --> 01:13:51,792
I love curling up with
a rich cup of coffee.

1150
01:13:52,035 --> 01:13:54,495
What, you think coffee and sleep
don't mix?

1151
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:58,874
Well, they do if it's High Point.
It's decaffeinated.

1152
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:01,419
And the flavor is marvelous.

1153
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:04,005
Do you have that mold
that makes cakes...?

1154
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,347
I have calf pants.

1155
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:10,185
I have pants just for my calves.
Calf pants.

1156
01:14:17,561 --> 01:14:19,320
Oh, my God.

1157
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:24,408
Could you do me a favor?

1158
01:14:24,568 --> 01:14:26,277
- What?
- Will you do me a kindness?

1159
01:14:26,278 --> 01:14:27,862
Mm.

1160
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:33,034
Will you ask me something personal
about myself?

1161
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:36,203
Hmm. Okay, fine. I'll do it.
And then we bang.

1162
01:14:36,204 --> 01:14:37,663
Yes.

1163
01:14:37,664 --> 01:14:39,173
What's your mother like?

1164
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:44,879
My mom is very beautiful.

1165
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,349
Um... Very vain.

1166
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,809
Very smart.

1167
01:14:51,303 --> 01:14:52,803
Cold.

1168
01:14:52,804 --> 01:14:54,605
And your dad?

1169
01:14:55,265 --> 01:14:56,607
Um...

1170
01:14:57,643 --> 01:15:00,611
He died a long time ago.

1171
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,731
He was such a sweet guy.

1172
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,866
He was probably too sweet.

1173
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:11,197
Very successful in business.

1174
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:16,619
He made a lot of money,
which is why I have all this stuff.

1175
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,712
But he was soft.

1176
01:15:19,498 --> 01:15:22,416
Just too soft, too sensitive.

1177
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:26,921
And, you know, Dad,
he couldn't really handle my mother...

1178
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:30,015
and didn't really make an effort.

1179
01:16:01,081 --> 01:16:03,082
Hey, Jacob, it's Cal.

1180
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:04,625
Where are you?

1181
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:07,962
Remember the first woman I picked up,
that teacher?

1182
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,943
Well, I have a story to tell you
about her.

1183
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:14,009
It's been a week. I haven't heard
from you. Should I be concerned?

1184
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:16,770
I am imagining you suffocating
under a pile of women. Call me.

1185
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:20,274
Oh. Yeah, hey, it's me again.

1186
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:23,652
Left like a hundred messages.

1187
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:29,783
Listen, if this is a Miyagi thing,
I'm not getting it, so...

1188
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,786
Call me back, please. Thanks.

1189
01:16:56,595 --> 01:16:59,597
- Been to St. Louis?
- No, I haven't.

1190
01:16:59,598 --> 01:17:03,726
I always dreamt of playing shortstop for
the St. Louis Cardinals, actually...

1191
01:17:03,727 --> 01:17:07,021
but I couldn't hit a curveball,
so I did the next best thing.

1192
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:08,731
Yeah, you became an accountant.

1193
01:17:08,732 --> 01:17:10,149
Right. Exactly.

1194
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:12,943
I mean, the money's not as good,
but there's less travel.

1195
01:17:12,944 --> 01:17:14,153
Mm. Ha, ha.

1196
01:17:14,154 --> 01:17:16,697
- I was gonna be a ballerina.
- Really?

1197
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:19,116
So tell me, what is it with women
and ballerinas?

1198
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:21,619
I just pictured myself in the ballet.

1199
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:24,413
It's not like I had
a lot of training or anything.

1200
01:17:24,414 --> 01:17:27,249
I mean, I actually never really
had a lesson...

1201
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:31,011
and, um, haven't seen a ballet.

1202
01:17:31,296 --> 01:17:32,963
You've never been to the ballet?

1203
01:17:32,964 --> 01:17:35,341
- Mm-mm.
- Wow.

1204
01:17:35,342 --> 01:17:38,761
- I'd love to take you to the ballet.
- You'd love to go to the ballet?

1205
01:17:38,762 --> 01:17:42,306
I didn't say that. I'd love to take you
to the ballet. I'd drop you off.

1206
01:17:42,307 --> 01:17:45,434
Later on I'd pick you up
and we could go to a ball game.

1207
01:17:45,435 --> 01:17:46,860
Oh, I get it.

1208
01:17:49,773 --> 01:17:52,991
- Ha, ha.
- I had a lot of fun tonight.

1209
01:17:54,402 --> 01:17:57,446
You like sushi? I know this really
great little sushi place...

1210
01:17:57,447 --> 01:17:58,656
I don't eat sushi.

1211
01:17:58,657 --> 01:18:01,375
- That we're never gonna go to
because I hate sushi.

1212
01:18:11,127 --> 01:18:13,254
Oh, hi. Hi, Jess.

1213
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,923
Uh, this is my work friend, David.

1214
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,633
David is an accountant.

1215
01:18:17,634 --> 01:18:20,060
David, this is Jessica, my babysitter.

1216
01:18:20,345 --> 01:18:21,728
Uh...

1217
01:18:22,722 --> 01:18:25,266
So, you know, everything looks great.

1218
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:28,610
Spreadsheets.

1219
01:18:31,857 --> 01:18:33,148
See you at work.

1220
01:18:33,149 --> 01:18:35,075
Yeah, see you at work.

1221
01:18:39,364 --> 01:18:41,240
So how was dinner?

1222
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:43,701
- Oh, well, you know, it was just for work.
- Yeah.

1223
01:18:43,702 --> 01:18:47,546
- That's a really pretty dress.
- Thank you. What do I owe you?

1224
01:18:47,873 --> 01:18:51,250
Do you know that your kids
are the only ones that I babysit for...

1225
01:18:51,251 --> 01:18:55,179
that wanna stay awake so that they
can see their dad when he gets home?

1226
01:18:55,964 --> 01:19:00,718
Yeah, I mean, they fight with everything
they have to keep their eyes open.

1227
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,511
And don't get me wrong...

1228
01:19:02,512 --> 01:19:07,524
no, your kids are really excited to see
you when you get home too, Ms. Weaver...

1229
01:19:08,351 --> 01:19:11,778
but not a lot wanna stay up for Dad.

1230
01:19:14,232 --> 01:19:16,525
Honey, what are you trying to say?

1231
01:19:16,526 --> 01:19:17,776
Batshit crazy.

1232
01:19:17,777 --> 01:19:19,778
Jessica, uh, what...?

1233
01:19:19,779 --> 01:19:22,531
- Let me give you...
- I don't want your slutty money.

1234
01:19:22,532 --> 01:19:26,585
Sweetheart, what's the pro...?
What's wrong?

1235
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:31,590
"Slutty money"?

1236
01:21:27,532 --> 01:21:28,874
Kids.

1237
01:21:31,536 --> 01:21:35,047
Kids. Ice cream.

1238
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:48,727
- I knew it. I knew it.
- Yeah. I'll be right back.

1239
01:22:02,859 --> 01:22:04,951
Oh, shit. Oh, God.

1240
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:18,332
Hello?

1241
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,509
- Hi, Cal.
- Hi.

1242
01:22:20,877 --> 01:22:22,511
Um...

1243
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:24,880
So...

1244
01:22:24,881 --> 01:22:28,850
I'm just calling, um...

1245
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:33,347
because I'm in the basement...

1246
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:36,483
and I'm trying to get
the water heater working, um...

1247
01:22:37,769 --> 01:22:41,696
because the pilot light's out
and I don't know how to relight it.

1248
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,982
So I'm sorry to bother you.

1249
01:22:43,983 --> 01:22:47,828
No, no. It's fine. That's fine.
Call me...

1250
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:50,781
I'm glad you called about this.

1251
01:22:50,782 --> 01:22:53,375
- I'll just walk you through it, okay?
- Okay.

1252
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:58,956
All right, so there's a gray door.
You see the gray door?

1253
01:22:58,957 --> 01:23:02,342
- Yeah.
- Okay, just slide that down.

1254
01:23:03,336 --> 01:23:04,545
Okay.

1255
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:07,798
There's a red button
with the word "push" on it.

1256
01:23:07,799 --> 01:23:10,058
I wrote the word "push" on it?

1257
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:14,555
So you push it.
And you turn it to the right.

1258
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:16,189
I got it.

1259
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,567
And then just put the match in.

1260
01:23:21,354 --> 01:23:23,363
Oh, there it goes.

1261
01:23:23,731 --> 01:23:27,576
Just have to slide the gray door
down again and you're good to go.

1262
01:23:28,695 --> 01:23:30,287
Oh.

1263
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:36,577
Well, thanks, Cal. I
appreciate your help.

1264
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:40,630
Oh, you know what? Just call anytime
with stuff like that. That's...

1265
01:23:41,749 --> 01:23:44,168
Oh, yeah. Uh...

1266
01:23:44,169 --> 01:23:45,802
Yeah. Oh.

1267
01:23:46,129 --> 01:23:47,637
Sure.

1268
01:23:48,047 --> 01:23:50,056
So I'll talk to you soon.

1269
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:52,559
Yeah, and, um...

1270
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:55,971
Thanks again.

1271
01:23:55,972 --> 01:23:58,899
No, that's... My pleasure.

1272
01:24:01,477 --> 01:24:03,236
Don't want you to blow up the house.

1273
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:08,783
Bye.

1274
01:24:27,086 --> 01:24:29,463
- Dad, can we go to McDonald's?
- Uh, no.

1275
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:30,889
Why not?

1276
01:24:32,091 --> 01:24:33,550
Check it out.

1277
01:24:33,551 --> 01:24:35,802
Only reason they play them
is they're catchy.

1278
01:24:35,803 --> 01:24:37,846
- Thank you.
- Here you go, sir.

1279
01:24:37,847 --> 01:24:39,514
Now, does it come in sheets...?

1280
01:24:39,515 --> 01:24:42,893
Oh, yeah, it's a 4 by 8. Standard 4
by 8, your 3/4 inch stock. Yeah.

1281
01:24:42,894 --> 01:24:45,979
- Now, this is for my wife.
- Oh. That's nice.

1282
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,314
It has curtains.

1283
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:48,774
- Oh, hey, Cal.
- Hey, Bernie.

1284
01:24:48,775 --> 01:24:50,651
- Hi, Mr. Riley.
- Hi, Mr. Riley.

1285
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:51,818
- How's it going?
- Oh, good.

1286
01:24:51,819 --> 01:24:54,988
I'd love to catch up, but I'm doing
something to the house later.

1287
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:56,490
Kind of in a rush.

1288
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:58,158
Thanks for the cologne.

1289
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,126
Do you know if this is chintz?

1290
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:02,913
- Hello?
- Cal.

1291
01:25:02,914 --> 01:25:04,957
- Jacob.
- Oh, my God, it's alive.

1292
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:07,542
Hey, sorry I kind of dropped off
the grid there, pal.

1293
01:25:07,543 --> 01:25:10,212
You left me in my hour of need,
my friend.

1294
01:25:10,213 --> 01:25:11,421
Yeah, well...

1295
01:25:11,422 --> 01:25:14,675
I'm in a bit of a situation.

1296
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:16,385
A pickle, if you will.

1297
01:25:16,386 --> 01:25:18,728
- I got no one else to call.
- Ha, ha.

1298
01:25:18,846 --> 01:25:21,014
- I met a girl.
- Oh, really?

1299
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:24,434
I'm spending all this time with her
and she is a game changer.

1300
01:25:24,435 --> 01:25:26,645
She's a game changer? No way.

1301
01:25:26,646 --> 01:25:29,064
So much so I'm going to meet
her mother right now.

1302
01:25:29,065 --> 01:25:32,401
A mother and daughter. That's very
Wilt Chamberlain-esque, even for you.

1303
01:25:32,402 --> 01:25:34,069
- What is the matter with you?
- Ha, ha.

1304
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:36,363
I don't know what to do.
I need some advice.

1305
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:40,367
You might actually have to answer
some personal questions about yourself.

1306
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:42,744
You gotta smile a lot.
You've gotta be charming.

1307
01:25:42,745 --> 01:25:44,037
Definitely don't be yourself.

1308
01:25:44,038 --> 01:25:46,039
That's what you've got for me,
don't be myself?

1309
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,792
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Great. Thanks for nothing.

1310
01:25:48,793 --> 01:25:50,385
Do you wanna get a?

1311
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:53,213
Do you wanna get a beer next week?

1312
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:55,132
You have my number.

1313
01:25:55,133 --> 01:25:57,926
And, you know, don't worry
about tonight. You'll be fine.

1314
01:25:57,927 --> 01:26:00,770
- Good for you, by the way.
- See you, buddy.

1315
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:04,399
Honk. You gotta get that fixed.

1316
01:26:05,893 --> 01:26:08,862
- Okay. All right.
- Let's go.

1317
01:26:31,627 --> 01:26:33,303
Va-jay-jay.

1318
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,189
Out of this fourth inning
with just one run in.

1319
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:56,735
He's right on the verge of a big hit
knocking him out of the game here.

1320
01:26:56,736 --> 01:26:59,954
He's staying in there,
very competitive today.

1321
01:27:19,592 --> 01:27:22,686
No, no, no. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

1322
01:27:23,388 --> 01:27:26,139
No, leave him. Let him go.
He can handle it. Let him go.

1323
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,642
Honey! Get out of my purse.
Stay out of my purse!

1324
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:32,771
Do not take those keys! Do not take those
keys! I'm not letting you take those keys.

1325
01:27:32,772 --> 01:27:35,565
You're not following your father!
Stop it!

1326
01:27:35,566 --> 01:27:38,860
No! No! Let your father handle it.
You're not to see that man again!

1327
01:27:38,861 --> 01:27:40,153
That man's a pervert!

1328
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:41,571
- Stay out of it!
- No!

1329
01:27:41,572 --> 01:27:43,456
Is that pervert sexting you?

1330
01:27:43,574 --> 01:27:44,916
Hey, baby.

1331
01:27:45,243 --> 01:27:46,493
What are you wearing?

1332
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:49,830
Dad's here. I have to blindfold you.

1333
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:52,716
- Why? What's he doing?
- Just come on.

1334
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:06,104
Hate this. Bad.

1335
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:09,558
Is this something
I'm gonna have to clean up?

1336
01:28:09,559 --> 01:28:11,685
Mom, no, don't worry about it.
Keep going.

1337
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:14,354
- Honey, honey, I really can't see.
- Mom, I got you.

1338
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:17,023
Two. Right now we're on the ground.
One more step.

1339
01:28:17,024 --> 01:28:18,525
- Three.
- Three. Yay.

1340
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,861
Mom, no more steps.
We're on the ground.

1341
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:24,030
Mom, relax.
It's your husband, not Al Qaeda.

1342
01:28:24,031 --> 01:28:25,198
Hi, Em.

1343
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,868
Oh, hey. Can I take
this off now, please?

1344
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:30,003
- Nope, not yet.
- Oh, what's this?

1345
01:28:31,038 --> 01:28:33,006
- I hear you, gigglepuss.
- Do it.

1346
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:39,387
May I have your attention?

1347
01:28:42,258 --> 01:28:47,220
Many years ago, in the hallway
of Woodside Middle School...

1348
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:50,724
Cal Weaver saw Emily Boyle
for the first time.

1349
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:53,852
Cal, are you seriously gonna do this
in front of the kids?

1350
01:28:53,853 --> 01:28:55,061
Mm-hm.

1351
01:28:55,062 --> 01:28:58,531
If anything goes wrong I'm supposed to
take her upstairs and put the TV on loud.

1352
01:28:58,649 --> 01:29:01,902
All right. Well, we may as well wait
for your daughter.

1353
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:04,738
- She's right here.
- No, no, no. I mean our other daughter.

1354
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:06,198
- Hello?
- Nanna.

1355
01:29:06,199 --> 01:29:08,742
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, sweetheart.

1356
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:10,660
- Hi.
- What's going on?

1357
01:29:10,661 --> 01:29:14,581
Oh, I don't know. Some game. He won't
let me take this dumb blindfold off.

1358
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:16,466
- Cal?
- Is that him?

1359
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:17,918
What are you doing here?

1360
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:21,046
- What are you doing here?
- Wait, do you guys know each other?

1361
01:29:21,047 --> 01:29:23,215
- What's going on?
- What are you doing here?

1362
01:29:23,216 --> 01:29:25,550
- Hey, Nanna.
- Hi, Robbie.

1363
01:29:25,551 --> 01:29:27,135
- Hey, Nanna.
- Hi, cutie.

1364
01:29:27,136 --> 01:29:28,678
Jacob, it's so nice to meet you.

1365
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:31,389
I've heard so many wonderful things
about you from Nanna.

1366
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:33,266
- I'm sorry, what's a Nanna?
- I am.

1367
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:35,560
I couldn't say Hannah.
How do you know my dad?

1368
01:29:35,561 --> 01:29:37,938
She couldn't say her H's at all.

1369
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:41,241
Okay. I'm having trouble understanding
what's going on right now.

1370
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:45,737
- Dad, this is Jacob, my boyfriend.
- No, it's not.

1371
01:29:45,738 --> 01:29:48,615
- I was bringing him over to meet Mom.
- No. No. No, no, no.

1372
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:50,867
- I wanna see the boyfriend.
- I can't breathe.

1373
01:29:50,868 --> 01:29:52,202
Can I take this off?

1374
01:29:52,203 --> 01:29:54,913
Cal, what are you doing
with a daughter that's grown up?

1375
01:29:54,914 --> 01:29:57,541
I was 17. That's why we had to get
married so young.

1376
01:29:57,542 --> 01:30:00,669
- You should have told me.
- Never wanted me to talk about my children.

1377
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:04,256
- Um, I'm gonna go watch TV now.
- That's fine. Why don't you go do that?

1378
01:30:04,257 --> 01:30:05,799
- Yeah. Can I come?
- No.

1379
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,260
So you guys, like,
really know each other, then.

1380
01:30:08,261 --> 01:30:11,054
Oh, screw it. This is ridiculous.

1381
01:30:11,055 --> 01:30:13,098
- Honey, he's really cute.
- No, he's not.

1382
01:30:13,099 --> 01:30:15,984
Look at you. You're really a mother?
I don't believe it, sister.

1383
01:30:16,185 --> 01:30:18,645
Let me get this straight.
So you guys are a thing.

1384
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:21,189
You guys are a couple, right?
You guys are together?

1385
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:23,491
- Yeah.
- No way. Break up right now.

1386
01:30:23,568 --> 01:30:25,618
- Daddy?
- Please don't call him that.

1387
01:30:26,153 --> 01:30:28,947
- Cal, that's not gonna happen.
- Then I will mess you up.

1388
01:30:28,948 --> 01:30:30,198
- Dad.
- Cal.

1389
01:30:30,199 --> 01:30:31,408
- Cal.
- Jessica?

1390
01:30:31,409 --> 01:30:32,750
Bernie?

1391
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:35,453
Daddy, no.

1392
01:30:35,454 --> 01:30:38,673
I let her babysit for you,
you son of a bitch.

1393
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:41,876
- She's only 17 years old.
- What are you talking about?

1394
01:30:41,877 --> 01:30:44,004
- Oh, God.
- No idea what you're talking about.

1395
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:45,297
- Aah!
- Bernie.

1396
01:30:45,298 --> 01:30:48,725
Daddy, no. No, no, no. Stop it.

1397
01:30:50,553 --> 01:30:52,554
- Dad.
- Jacob! Oh, God.

1398
01:30:52,555 --> 01:30:54,306
Stop it. He didn't do anything.

1399
01:30:54,307 --> 01:30:56,224
- He doesn't know.
- Is your back okay?

1400
01:30:56,225 --> 01:30:57,892
- Know what?
- Know what?

1401
01:30:57,893 --> 01:31:00,228
Is this some kind of a skit?
Because I'm lost.

1402
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:01,438
- Argh!
- No.

1403
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:04,190
- Aah!
- No, no, no. Daddy, Daddy.

1404
01:31:04,191 --> 01:31:06,291
He didn't even know
that I'm in love with him.

1405
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:08,486
- With who?
- With him.

1406
01:31:08,487 --> 01:31:10,572
- You pointing at me?
- You pointing at him?

1407
01:31:10,573 --> 01:31:12,532
She's pointing at him? Oh.

1408
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:15,535
Wait. My dad is the older guy
you've been seeing?

1409
01:31:15,536 --> 01:31:18,788
- I knew it. You...
- He doesn't know about the naked photos.

1410
01:31:18,789 --> 01:31:20,707
- What?
- Jessica.

1411
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,626
You made him naked photos? Seriously?

1412
01:31:22,627 --> 01:31:26,421
- I'm gonna beat you till your brains fall out.
- Timeout, timeout. Hold on.

1413
01:31:26,422 --> 01:31:29,591
- But I love her.
- Jessica's the one you're in love with?

1414
01:31:29,592 --> 01:31:31,684
Excuse me, Emily?

1415
01:31:32,178 --> 01:31:34,721
- You left your sweater in my car.
- Oh.

1416
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:36,564
- Who are you?
- David Lindhagen.

1417
01:31:38,184 --> 01:31:40,526
- David Lindhagen?
- David Lindhagen.

1418
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:43,229
Okay.

1419
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:45,482
- Is this a bad time?
- Yeah.

1420
01:31:46,683 --> 01:31:47,608
Jacob!

1421
01:31:47,652 --> 01:31:50,445
Know how much pain and suffering
you caused my friend?

1422
01:31:50,446 --> 01:31:52,447
- Stay the hell away from my daughter.
- Ow.

1423
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,324
You stay away from my daughter.

1424
01:31:54,325 --> 01:31:56,576
- I don't even know you.
- Stop it.

1425
01:31:56,577 --> 01:31:59,170
Oh, my God. That is not...
What are you grabbing?

1426
01:32:01,832 --> 01:32:03,917
- Really? Really?
- Come on.

1427
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:06,795
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Let go of me!

1428
01:32:06,796 --> 01:32:09,255
- Come on, she's my daughter.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1429
01:32:09,256 --> 01:32:10,556
I'll kill you.

1430
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:14,135
So...

1431
01:32:14,136 --> 01:32:16,638
Okay, wait. Which one of you
is Lindhagen again?

1432
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:18,064
Hagen.

1433
01:32:18,683 --> 01:32:21,434
I'm just gonna write,
"Domestic disturbance, all clear."

1434
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:22,902
Thank you, officer.

1435
01:32:23,646 --> 01:32:27,065
Just simmer down, okay?
We all have arguments.

1436
01:32:27,066 --> 01:32:31,077
But if you're gonna fight, just do it
inside. Keep it in the family, okay?

1437
01:32:32,863 --> 01:32:34,288
I will kill you.

1438
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:46,167
Let's go.

1439
01:32:46,168 --> 01:32:47,593
- Daddy?
- Now.

1440
01:32:47,712 --> 01:32:49,929
- Daddy?
- Now.

1441
01:33:21,871 --> 01:33:23,246
Cal.

1442
01:33:23,247 --> 01:33:24,714
Come on.

1443
01:33:24,915 --> 01:33:26,257
Honey.

1444
01:33:28,669 --> 01:33:32,297
This guy is a lowlife,
he is a womanizer.

1445
01:33:32,298 --> 01:33:35,349
- That's ironic.
- Excuse me?

1446
01:33:39,138 --> 01:33:42,015
I know him.
I have witnessed him in action.

1447
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:46,186
- And you are not to see him anymore.
- Dad, I'm not gonna stop seeing him.

1448
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:49,655
Okay. Okay. Well, then we have
nothing more to talk about.

1449
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:55,069
- You're being unreasonable.
- Get out of my house.

1450
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:56,529
This is not your house anymore.

1451
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:59,624
Well, you made damn sure of that,
didn't you, sweetheart?

1452
01:34:13,589 --> 01:34:16,182
- Bye, Nanna.
- Bye, cutie.

1453
01:34:27,102 --> 01:34:28,945
She's all yours, David.

1454
01:34:30,105 --> 01:34:33,783
- Fantastic.
- Nice.

1455
01:34:41,784 --> 01:34:44,001
Go big or go home, right, bud?

1456
01:34:45,788 --> 01:34:47,505
Go home, Dad.

1457
01:35:44,346 --> 01:35:46,514
- Did you see the headline today?
- What?

1458
01:35:46,515 --> 01:35:49,475
It says that you should call your dad.

1459
01:35:49,476 --> 01:35:51,978
No, it says,
"Let's move on child obesity." Ha, ha.

1460
01:35:51,979 --> 01:35:53,813
No, it doesn't.

1461
01:35:53,814 --> 01:35:57,116
- I'm not gonna call him.
- No, it says you really should.

1462
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:37,823
Can I get you another?

1463
01:36:38,567 --> 01:36:40,993
- What time is it?
- 2:30.

1464
01:36:41,737 --> 01:36:43,621
In the afternoon.

1465
01:36:43,822 --> 01:36:45,949
"Two-thirty" would have
been sufficient...

1466
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:49,919
but thank you for the judgmental tone,
cocktail servant.

1467
01:36:50,412 --> 01:36:51,754
I'm sorry...

1468
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:55,967
Sorry for being a dick.

1469
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:00,263
Nice sweat suit.

1470
01:37:04,551 --> 01:37:05,893
What do you want?

1471
01:37:07,054 --> 01:37:09,939
- Uh, can I sit down?
- I don't know, can you?

1472
01:37:10,474 --> 01:37:14,227
Are we gonna be adults about this,
or we gonna...?

1473
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:16,696
"Are we gonna be adults about this?"

1474
01:37:24,947 --> 01:37:29,292
- It would mean a lot to me if we could talk.
- Are you still seeing my daughter?

1475
01:37:31,245 --> 01:37:34,755
- Yes.
- Then I have nothing to say to you.

1476
01:37:35,582 --> 01:37:37,466
Been hanging out here a lot?

1477
01:37:37,584 --> 01:37:39,302
Sometimes.

1478
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:44,799
- You been missing a lot of work?
- I have a lot of vacation days.

1479
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,393
You know what? You have a lot of nerve.

1480
01:37:58,230 --> 01:37:59,689
Do you wanna do your shot?

1481
01:37:59,690 --> 01:38:03,075
She probably spit in it,
so, no, thank you.

1482
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:07,655
Your kids miss you, Cal.

1483
01:38:07,656 --> 01:38:10,491
You're hanging out with my kids?
That's great.

1484
01:38:10,492 --> 01:38:13,252
Teach Robbie how to objectify women.
He'll love that.

1485
01:38:16,623 --> 01:38:21,010
You know it's his eighth-grade
graduation next week.

1486
01:38:21,462 --> 01:38:22,920
You gonna go to that?

1487
01:38:22,921 --> 01:38:24,297
Of course I'm going.

1488
01:38:24,298 --> 01:38:28,634
I just didn't know. You haven't really been
around. I don't think he knows either.

1489
01:38:28,635 --> 01:38:31,804
I haven't been around for him?
That's what you're telling me?

1490
01:38:31,805 --> 01:38:34,015
You know,
he's not my biggest fan right now.

1491
01:38:34,016 --> 01:38:36,934
- He thinks I stole his soul mate.
- He worships you, Cal.

1492
01:38:36,935 --> 01:38:40,529
- Is the parental advice over? Because if so...
- I'm in love with her.

1493
01:38:42,858 --> 01:38:44,450
I love her.

1494
01:38:45,986 --> 01:38:48,988
I don't know what I was doing
before this.

1495
01:38:48,989 --> 01:38:54,377
And I don't know what to do about it.
It's not something I can really stop.

1496
01:38:54,578 --> 01:38:56,537
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1497
01:38:56,538 --> 01:38:58,456
- You love her? You love Hannah?
- Yes.

1498
01:38:58,457 --> 01:39:02,301
Tell me about it.
Tell me how much you love her.

1499
01:39:02,419 --> 01:39:03,803
I'm just...

1500
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:07,340
Look, Cal, it's not something
that I wanted, okay?

1501
01:39:07,341 --> 01:39:09,342
I looked at people who were in love...

1502
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:11,928
and I thought
the way that they were behaving...

1503
01:39:11,929 --> 01:39:14,514
and the things that they were doing
and saying...

1504
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:16,974
they appeared pathetic, honestly.

1505
01:39:16,975 --> 01:39:20,645
And I spent all this time with you,
I'm trying to make you more like me...

1506
01:39:20,646 --> 01:39:23,364
and it turns out I just wanna be...

1507
01:39:28,028 --> 01:39:29,529
I need that drink.

1508
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:32,123
You gonna make me do this?
I gotta really do this?

1509
01:39:37,037 --> 01:39:40,339
I had Hannah when I was 17.

1510
01:39:40,624 --> 01:39:43,342
I taught her how to ride a bike.

1511
01:39:44,419 --> 01:39:47,179
I taught her how to drive a car.

1512
01:39:47,381 --> 01:39:50,216
And I'm glad for you.

1513
01:39:50,217 --> 01:39:54,478
I'm happy for you, that you've changed.

1514
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:59,650
I think it's fantastic
that you're a better man.

1515
01:40:00,602 --> 01:40:02,812
But I've seen too much already.

1516
01:40:02,813 --> 01:40:07,616
- No. I know. I know too much.
- I know. I know.

1517
01:40:08,944 --> 01:40:10,703
And it's Hannah.

1518
01:40:10,737 --> 01:40:13,038
And she's too good for you.

1519
01:40:13,448 --> 01:40:15,082
I agree.

1520
01:40:18,871 --> 01:40:21,714
I'm never gonna give you my approval.

1521
01:40:31,383 --> 01:40:33,767
You're a good dad, Cal.

1522
01:40:47,983 --> 01:40:49,358
Yep. Yep.

1523
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:52,244
She spit. She spit in that.

1524
01:40:52,279 --> 01:40:54,155
Guys, I need you to pay attention.

1525
01:40:54,156 --> 01:40:58,618
Do not cut the line. I need everyone
to stay in your positions, okay?

1526
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:03,122
Guys, check your ties.
Make sure everything is nice and neat.

1527
01:41:03,123 --> 01:41:05,132
Ladies, when you're on stage...

1528
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:16,894
Mommy, look. Robbie's name.

1529
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:40,417
Excuse me. Is this open?

1530
01:41:56,134 --> 01:41:58,143
- How close?
- Yeah, that's fine.

1531
01:42:05,686 --> 01:42:07,395
Good afternoon.

1532
01:42:07,396 --> 01:42:10,823
Welcome, parents, family and friends.

1533
01:42:10,899 --> 01:42:15,160
We're so pleased to have you here
to celebrate this graduating class.

1534
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:20,032
And now, to introduce
our first student speaker...

1535
01:42:20,033 --> 01:42:24,086
our very own Kate Tafferty.

1536
01:42:26,873 --> 01:42:28,966
- She's pretty.
- Ugh.

1537
01:42:31,586 --> 01:42:36,682
Our first speaker is not only
the class salutatorian...

1538
01:42:36,717 --> 01:42:40,144
but is also...

1539
01:42:41,346 --> 01:42:44,890
one of the most spirited young men...

1540
01:42:44,891 --> 01:42:47,768
I've ever had the pleasure of teaching.

1541
01:42:47,769 --> 01:42:51,780
Ladies and gentlemen, Robbie Weaver.

1542
01:42:54,109 --> 01:42:55,534
- Whoo!
- Robbie!

1543
01:43:04,077 --> 01:43:06,795
Welcome, class of 2011.

1544
01:43:07,372 --> 01:43:10,916
Our time as middle schoolers
has come to an end.

1545
01:43:10,917 --> 01:43:13,886
We can't fight it anymore.
We're getting old.

1546
01:43:19,885 --> 01:43:23,729
All my life I wanted to grow up.

1547
01:43:23,930 --> 01:43:28,567
I wanted to grow older
so people would take me seriously.

1548
01:43:28,935 --> 01:43:32,738
It all sounded so good to me.

1549
01:43:32,773 --> 01:43:37,534
Growing up, getting a job,
getting married.

1550
01:43:37,944 --> 01:43:39,578
But...

1551
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,955
it's all a scam.

1552
01:43:42,616 --> 01:43:44,249
And love?

1553
01:43:45,285 --> 01:43:47,127
That's the biggest scam of all.

1554
01:43:49,414 --> 01:43:51,757
I was in love.

1555
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:56,762
And I know that makes some of you laugh
because I'm only 13...

1556
01:43:57,631 --> 01:44:00,683
but whatever. I was.

1557
01:44:02,052 --> 01:44:05,729
And I used to think,
and really believe...

1558
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:09,775
that there was one true love
for everyone...

1559
01:44:09,976 --> 01:44:13,646
and if you fought hard enough
for that person...

1560
01:44:13,647 --> 01:44:15,948
your one true love
would always work out.

1561
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:21,870
It sounded good to me when I was younger,
but it just doesn't work that way.

1562
01:44:23,281 --> 01:44:27,793
- There is no such thing as one true love...
- Stop.

1563
01:44:31,665 --> 01:44:34,291
Shit.

1564
01:44:34,292 --> 01:44:37,211
- Oh, boy.
- Okay.

1565
01:44:37,212 --> 01:44:39,847
All right. Ahem. Excuse me.

1566
01:44:52,436 --> 01:44:55,946
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1567
01:44:56,189 --> 01:44:59,032
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1568
01:44:59,234 --> 01:45:01,660
I was wrong, Dad.
There's no such thing as...

1569
01:45:03,613 --> 01:45:05,164
I, uh...

1570
01:45:05,574 --> 01:45:06,999
Um...

1571
01:45:12,247 --> 01:45:16,250
Oh. Well, here's the thing:

1572
01:45:16,251 --> 01:45:19,178
My son's graduation speech sucks.

1573
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:21,680
That's not a joke.

1574
01:45:22,507 --> 01:45:26,218
In fairness, I didn't know
where he was going with that.

1575
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:28,053
But I think we can all agree...

1576
01:45:28,054 --> 01:45:33,984
it was headed
in a kind of depressing, um, way.

1577
01:45:35,562 --> 01:45:38,898
My son... Not him, my actual son.

1578
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:41,650
- Believes in grand romantic gestures.

1579
01:45:41,651 --> 01:45:45,237
He believes in the existence...

1580
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:47,873
of one's soul mate.

1581
01:45:48,909 --> 01:45:52,328
And it's easy to just look
at a 13-year-old and say:

1582
01:45:52,329 --> 01:45:56,707
"You don't know what you're
talking about. You are wrong."

1583
01:45:56,708 --> 01:45:59,301
But I'm not so sure.

1584
01:46:03,048 --> 01:46:06,475
I met my soul mate
when I was 15 years old.

1585
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,886
We went out for ice cream.

1586
01:46:08,887 --> 01:46:13,766
After, my dad started teasing me
about my first date, the way dads do.

1587
01:46:13,767 --> 01:46:16,769
And I told him, "Dad, it's no big deal.

1588
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:22,316
I'm gonna be going out with a lot of different
girls on a lot of different dates."

1589
01:46:22,317 --> 01:46:26,119
And that is the first time
that I ever lied to my father.

1590
01:46:29,241 --> 01:46:32,076
I met my soul mate
when I was 15 years old...

1591
01:46:32,077 --> 01:46:37,130
and I have loved her
every minute of every day...

1592
01:46:37,415 --> 01:46:41,552
since I first bought her
that mint chocolate chip cone.

1593
01:46:42,921 --> 01:46:47,975
I have loved her through the birth
of my three perfect children.

1594
01:46:48,802 --> 01:46:51,436
I have loved her
even when I've hated her.

1595
01:46:52,973 --> 01:46:55,440
Only married couples
will understand that one.

1596
01:47:00,647 --> 01:47:02,823
And I don't know if
it's gonna work out.

1597
01:47:04,526 --> 01:47:06,869
I don't know what's gonna happen.

1598
01:47:08,613 --> 01:47:11,874
I'm sorry, Robbie, I
can't give you that.

1599
01:47:12,492 --> 01:47:15,210
But I can promise you this:

1600
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:17,713
I will never stop trying.

1601
01:47:18,790 --> 01:47:22,217
Because when you find the one...

1602
01:47:22,377 --> 01:47:24,219
you never give up.

1603
01:47:29,676 --> 01:47:31,852
Do you have anything you'd like to say?

1604
01:47:33,388 --> 01:47:35,408
I still love you, Jessica.

1605
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:40,068
And I love you, Emily.

1606
01:47:41,855 --> 01:47:45,232
I loved you ever since you first
changed my sister's diaper.

1607
01:47:45,233 --> 01:47:49,361
I loved you when you came into my
bedroom and I was under the covers...

1608
01:47:49,362 --> 01:47:51,363
- Stop him.
- No, no.

1609
01:47:51,364 --> 01:47:53,824
- What's he talking about?
- I'm not ashamed of it.

1610
01:47:53,825 --> 01:47:56,168
Okay, we're good, we're good.

1611
01:48:04,878 --> 01:48:08,472
Oh, there's your mom. Let's go say hi.

1612
01:48:08,506 --> 01:48:09,840
Hey.

1613
01:48:09,841 --> 01:48:12,426
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

1614
01:48:12,427 --> 01:48:14,762
There she is. My perfect girl.

1615
01:48:14,763 --> 01:48:16,605
Hi.

1616
01:48:21,186 --> 01:48:23,028
Okay.

1617
01:48:23,855 --> 01:48:25,572
So I bought a firearm...

1618
01:48:26,775 --> 01:48:28,233
from a shady Internet site...

1619
01:48:28,234 --> 01:48:30,661
and I am prepared to shoot you with it.

1620
01:48:32,572 --> 01:48:34,456
Come here.

1621
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:42,172
Take care of her.

1622
01:48:46,878 --> 01:48:51,348
This is gonna be fun.

1623
01:48:55,303 --> 01:48:56,929
I'm gonna talk to my friends.

1624
01:48:56,930 --> 01:49:01,066
Go hang with the other high schoolers.
Go ahead, see if I care. I don't care.

1625
01:49:35,385 --> 01:49:37,886
I'm really glad you came.

1626
01:49:37,887 --> 01:49:39,688
So am I.

1627
01:49:40,765 --> 01:49:43,358
You were a really good babysitter,
Jessica.

1628
01:49:44,853 --> 01:49:47,279
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

1629
01:49:48,273 --> 01:49:50,774
- I thought you weren't giving up.
- I'm not.

1630
01:49:50,775 --> 01:49:52,401
But I just figure...

1631
01:49:52,402 --> 01:49:54,027
you like my dad...

1632
01:49:54,028 --> 01:49:56,321
and in a few years I'll look like him.

1633
01:49:56,322 --> 01:49:57,789
I'll come for you then.

1634
01:49:58,324 --> 01:50:00,083
That's not a bad plan.

1635
01:50:00,243 --> 01:50:01,626
But...

1636
01:50:02,036 --> 01:50:04,329
Well, until then...

1637
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:08,759
just a little graduation gift
to get you through high school.

1638
01:50:09,461 --> 01:50:11,261
Thanks.

1639
01:50:19,429 --> 01:50:20,812
So...

1640
01:50:22,015 --> 01:50:24,308
Can you...?

1641
01:50:24,309 --> 01:50:26,651
- Why...?
- Take care, Robbie.

1642
01:50:52,253 --> 01:50:54,846
Holy crap.

1643
01:51:03,515 --> 01:51:07,484
- He looks pretty happy.
- Yeah.

1644
01:51:07,977 --> 01:51:10,062
God, I hate that haircut, though.

1645
01:51:10,063 --> 01:51:13,573
- I know. He looks like a sheepdog.
- Mm-hm.

1646
01:51:18,404 --> 01:51:22,874
Oh, my eyes! My eyes! My eyes!

1647
01:51:27,413 --> 01:51:29,714
It's been a really hard year.

1648
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,384
How so?

1649
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:40,092
Yeah, there were a couple little blips,
I guess.

1650
01:51:40,093 --> 01:51:43,395
- I know.
- I guess I just, you know...

1651
01:51:43,805 --> 01:51:47,399
Really what I want to say...

1652
01:51:49,435 --> 01:51:52,696
is that I'm so glad you bought me
that ice cream.

1653
01:51:55,149 --> 01:51:57,742
Me too.
