1
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,276
<i>Hello, you have reached...</i>

2
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,660
<i>The Ardor residence.</i>

3
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,447
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

4
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,911
<i>Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. It's Dani.</i>

5
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:02,121
<i>I'm sorry to be calling so late.</i>

6
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,249
<i>I'm just checking in.</i>

7
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,541
<i>Making sure everything's okay.</i>

8
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,838
<i>Listen,
I got kind of a scary e-mail from Terri</i>

9
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,424
<i>and she hasn't been responding.</i>

10
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,718
<i>Surprise, surprise.</i>

11
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:20,765
<i>But, yeah, it sounds like you guys
have been fighting or something happened.</i>

12
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,560
<i>Anyway, I just got a little worried.</i>

13
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,604
<i>So, if you can call when you can.</i>

14
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,856
<i>And of course you know I'm always here</i>

15
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,192
<i>if you need anything, of course.</i>

16
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,074
Okay, I love you. All right, bye.

17
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,938
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey, sweetie.

18
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,148
What are you up to?

19
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,653
<i>Just smoked some resin with Mark,
and now we're getting pizza.</i>

20
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,393
Oh, nice.

21
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,479
<i>Yeah...</i>

22
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,328
<i>he's saying hi right now, over and over.</i>

23
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,414
- Hi, Mark.
<i>- Hi, Mark.</i>

24
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:14,963
So I was calling just to see if you...
You still wanted to hang out later.

25
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,760
<i>Did we talk about doing something tonight?</i>

26
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,306
I mean, not... not concretely,
but I just wanted to see.

27
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,935
<i>Well, okay.</i>

28
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,813
<i>Yeah, I should be able to swing by.</i>

29
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,149
- Cool.
<i>- Yeah, okay.</i>

30
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,947
<i>How's the sister situation?</i>

31
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:44,991
Well...

32
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:48,126
Yeah...

33
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,042
I've e-mailed her three times, and

34
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,422
still no response,
so I'm getting a little bit nervous.

35
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,341
<i>I'm sure it's fine.</i>

36
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,178
- Yeah, probably.
<i>- She does this every other day, Dani.</i>

37
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,712
<i>And only because you let her.</i>

38
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,183
- Well, I don't let her. She's bipolar.
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

39
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:13,062
<i>But you do, though, babes.
You go straight to crisis mode.</i>

40
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,731
Well, she's my sister,

41
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,443
and even you said
that this e-mail seemed different.

42
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,362
<i>Yeah, right, but</i>

43
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,865
<i>is it though, really?</i>

44
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,076
<i>It's still just another
obvious ploy for attention,</i>

45
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,660
<i>just like every other panic attack
she's given you.</i>

46
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:31,915
Yeah, you're right.

47
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,667
You are right. Yeah, I know.

48
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,837
<i>I mean, the more you respond,
the more she's encouraged to keep...</i>

49
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,172
No, I know, I know, I know. You're right.

50
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,706
I just... I just needed to be reminded.
Thank you.

51
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,262
I'm very lucky to have you.

52
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,681
<i>Yeah, well.</i>

53
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,892
I love you.

54
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,646
<i>I love you.</i>

55
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,109
Okay, I'll see you later?

56
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,277
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

57
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,363
- Bye, Mark.
<i>- Bye, Mark.</i>

58
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,450
Okay, I love you.

59
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,952
<i>- All right.</i>
- Bye.

60
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,331
It's in his tone.
Like, you can hear it in his voice.

61
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,250
He's just working up the nerve
to say something.

62
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,002
<i>So be direct. Confront him.</i>

63
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,963
What if I've scared him, though?
I'm always roping him into my family crap.

64
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,549
<i>- How do you rope him in?</i>
- I'm always leaning on him!

65
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,134
Like, I even called him today in tears

66
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,761
because my sister wrote
another stupid scary e-mail.

67
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,195
<i>That's what he's there for.</i>

68
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,100
What if I'm scaring him off?

69
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,534
<i>What did your sister write?</i>

70
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,939
Just some ominous bullshit
like she always does, and it's torture.

71
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,941
And I lean on him constantly for support.

72
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,527
Like, what if I have overwhelmed him,

73
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,738
and he thinks that
I just have too much baggage?

74
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,324
<i>Well, if that's the case,
then good riddance, right?</i>

75
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,119
No, not if I went too far,
if I leaned too much.

76
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,580
<i>You didn't. He should be there
when you need him.</i>

77
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,625
Yeah, but what if I need him too often,
and it becomes a chore?

78
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,002
<i>Then he's not the right guy.</i>

79
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,464
<i>Because it shouldn't ever be a chore.
Would it be a chore if he leaned on you?</i>

80
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,925
Yeah, but he doesn't ask me for anything.
I've never even seen him cry,

81
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,759
so I'm the only one that's leaning.

82
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,137
<i>Or the only one opening up.</i>

83
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,223
<i>The only one making yourself vulnerable.</i>

84
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,349
<i>That's intimacy.</i>

85
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,809
Dude.

86
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,993
You have gotta get off the fence
with this.

87
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,567
What if I regret it later,
and I can't get her back?

88
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,651
- You don't want her back.
- But I might.

89
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,280
Okay, well then you can

90
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,741
bitch to us about how much
you regret it for that day

91
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,326
and then we'll remind you again

92
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,119
that you've been wanting out
of this stupid relationship

93
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:38,040
for, like, a year now, and then you can
find a chick who actually likes sex

94
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,084
and doesn't drag you
through a million hoops every day.

95
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,628
Do you think that there is
a masochistic part of you

96
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,463
that is playing out this particular drama

97
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,897
to avoid the work
you actually need to be doing?

98
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,387
What work do I need to be doing,
Josh, exactly?

99
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,723
Well, I don't know.
Your prospectus, maybe? Your PhD?

100
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:56,934
Okay, thanks for the psychoanalysis.

101
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,644
It's not about academics, Josh.

102
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,354
- I'm just trying to get you focused.
- Change?

103
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,148
That's for you.

104
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,820
See? You could be getting
that girl pregnant right now.

105
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,614
And don't forget about all the Swedish
women you can impregnate in June.

106
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,032
- Okay, guys.
- Don't forget about

107
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,284
all the Swedish milkmaids.

108
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,437
That's not her again.

109
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,624
Seriously?

110
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,251
Oh, my God.

111
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,420
- She needs a therapist, dude.
- She has a therapist.

112
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,714
Oh, so then she should call
her therapist and not you.

113
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,090
It's literally abuse.

114
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,550
- She's abusing you.
- Excuse me.

115
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,635
- Nope.
- Oh, my God.

116
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,220
Okay, excuse me, guys.

117
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,639
Well, great.

118
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,398
- Hey.
<i>- No!</i>

119
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:49,320
- Dani, babe?
<i>- No, no, no, no.</i>

120
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,650
No, no, no, no, no!

121
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,168
Hey, babe.

122
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,836
How you feeling?

123
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,720
I'm up.

124
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,850
Where are you going?

125
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,936
I was just gonna go to that party
for 45 minutes.

126
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,313
But you just keep sleeping.

127
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,439
No.

128
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,691
No, I'll come with you.

129
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,567
You sure you've had enough sleep?

130
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,361
I wasn't sleeping anyway.

131
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,616
Yeah, I'm fucking dreading
the summer.

132
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,495
Stuck in shit-ass Boulder, listening
to my stepmom fuck my dad all day.

133
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,205
I'll listen to your stepmom
fuck your dad.

134
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,389
Josh, weren't you going to Europe?

135
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,670
Yeah, for my thesis.
Now we all are.

136
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,371
Oh, you're all going?

137
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,556
Yeah, they're all coming to
visit my home in Hälsingland.

138
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,452
Sweden.

139
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,389
Any occasion, or is it just for fun?

140
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,726
Well, I'm going for research.

141
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,520
These guys are just tagging along.

142
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:19,571
Mr. Pelle's invited us to an authentic
hippie midsummer at his yodeling farm.

143
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,030
Oh, yeah?

144
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,348
I mean, we were talking about it.

145
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,000
We were thinking about it.

146
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,663
For when?

147
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,541
Mid-June to mid-July?

148
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,502
Yeah, two weeks from now?

149
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,670
Yeah.

150
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,714
I mean, that's if we even go.

151
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,532
I'm probably not gonna go, but...

152
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,726
Yeah, we were talking about it.

153
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,886
You okay?

154
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:31,922
Fine.

155
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,187
That was just really weird.

156
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,023
What was?

157
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,656
The...

158
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,242
Sweden.

159
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,870
I had no idea.

160
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,340
Well, what do you mean?
'Cause I told you I wanted to go.

161
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,382
Okay, fine, but I didn't know
you were going.

162
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,678
I just decided today.

163
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,222
I wasn't keeping it from you.

164
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,933
You already have a ticket.

165
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,355
I'm sorry?

166
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,445
Okay. Well, just

167
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,240
imagine if you were at a party,
and someone said,

168
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,409
"Hey, what are you doing for summer?"

169
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,793
And then my friend said...

170
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,332
"Oh, we're going to China for three months
and we're leaving in two weeks."

171
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,250
- It's Sweden, for a month and a half.
- And it was the first

172
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,336
- you'd ever heard of it.
- Okay.

173
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,220
I told you I wanted to go to Sweden.

174
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,632
No, you said it would be cool to go.

175
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,050
Yeah, and then I got the opportunity

176
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,968
- and I decided to do it.
- Look, I don't mind you going.

177
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,221
I just wish
you would've told me, that's all.

178
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,973
Well, I just apologized, Dani.

179
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,033
You didn't apologize. You said "sorry,"
which sounds more like "too bad."

180
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,195
- Maybe I should just go home.
- What? No, no.

181
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,655
I'm just trying to understand.

182
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,450
- And I'm trying to apologize.
- And I don't need an apology. I don't.

183
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,634
I just wanted to talk about it,
that's all.

184
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,958
- I really think I should just leave.
- No, no, no, no.

185
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,585
Please, please, please.
I'm not trying to attack you. I'm not.

186
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,421
- It really feels like you are.
- Well, then, I'm sorry.

187
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,841
I just got confused. I'm sorry. I...

188
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,094
Hey, please, come on. Can you come...

189
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,178
- Just can you come...
- Just stop.

190
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,471
...and sit with me, please?

191
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,205
Please, and we can talk about it?

192
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,810
Look, it just felt really weird, okay?

193
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,194
But I'm fine. I think it's great
that you're going to Sweden, I do.

194
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,107
I think it's amazing.

195
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,902
Are you going for your thesis?

196
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,239
I don't know what my thesis is.

197
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,951
I know, and it can... it will...

198
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,995
It can be inspiring, right?

199
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:02,957
Right?

200
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,751
Hey.

201
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,879
Please, I overreacted. I'm sorry.

202
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,174
I'm sorry.

203
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,718
I know I get paranoid.

204
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,512
I don't mean to.

205
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,474
I know I overreacted, but I've been
trying to pull myself back up,

206
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,103
and I've been trying to deal
with this panic and my fears.

207
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,231
I didn't mean to put pressure on you
or to blame you for anything...

208
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,858
- Okay.
- I just got crazy for a second,

209
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,443
- and I didn't mean to project.
- Okay. Okay.

210
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,727
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

211
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,532
It's fine.

212
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,954
- I am sorry.
- It's fine.

213
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,299
I was gonna ask you
if you wanted to come with me.

214
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,305
What?

215
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,187
- What do you mean?
- What I just said.

216
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,605
To Sweden?

217
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,905
You don't want me to go.

218
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,699
I just asked.

219
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,083
- Yeah, after I broke down crying.
- Well, you ruined the surprise.

220
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,459
I wanted it to be romantic.

221
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,264
In Stockholm,
are there any, like, meatball sex clubs

222
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,248
we should hit up before we head north?

223
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,191
No, we're going straight north.

224
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,980
Not straight-straight, though, right?

225
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,690
We gotta go through Stockholm
to get there.

226
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,874
No, it's the opposite direction.
Stockholm is south of Arlanda.

227
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,444
Guys, it's Dani.

228
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,529
She's coming up.

229
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,574
Okay.

230
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,452
- Should we clear all this?
- No, it's fine.

231
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:14,296
I invited Dani to come to Sweden.

232
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,507
So you guys know.

233
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,758
She's not actually gonna come,

234
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,220
but I invited her
just to not make it weird.

235
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,307
You invited her to...

236
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,559
But she's not coming.

237
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,521
She doesn't want to?

238
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,859
I invited her, and she accepted,

239
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,112
but she's not actually coming to Sweden.

240
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,489
Okay.

241
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,442
Guys, you know what
she's been going through.

242
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,372
Yeah, no, dude, I just...

243
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,207
- thought you were...
- Yeah, dude, nobody minds.

244
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,168
Thought you were saying
something else, that's all.

245
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,253
Okay, that's great.

246
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,674
And just so we're clear,
you guys told me to invite her,

247
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,010
and you all know that she's coming,
agreed?

248
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,636
Yep.

249
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,570
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

250
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,849
Hey, guys.

251
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,976
- Hey.
- Yo.

252
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,145
How's it going?

253
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,064
We're chilling.

254
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,149
Nice.

255
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,194
So, Sweden.

256
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,446
- Yeah.
- You're coming, right?

257
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,698
I mean, I...

258
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,118
I guess so, if that's not
completely ruining you guys' plans.

259
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,121
- No, no.
- No, not at all.

260
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,943
Christian, can I get you to take a look
at this paragraph real quick?

261
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,883
Yeah, sure.

262
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,954
I'll be back.

263
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,559
- Hey, Pelle.
- Hi.

264
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,101
What were you drawing?

265
00:22:01,595 --> 00:22:02,695
Just the table.

266
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,366
How have you been?

267
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,034
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

268
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,286
Survived finals, so...

269
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,080
You know. And you?

270
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,991
I didn't... I didn't quite finish,
but they're giving me a break this year.

271
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,631
Oh, God, yes. Yes, of course. Sorry.

272
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,718
No, it's... How did you like
the anthropology department?

273
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,764
I like it, yeah.
Not as much as this one maybe, but...

274
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,192
You're doing psychiatry, right?

275
00:22:33,564 --> 00:22:34,894
Psychology, yeah.

276
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,147
- Okay.
- That's how you know I'm nuts.

277
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,581
Yeah. Also that funny look in your eye.

278
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,960
So you're coming to Hälsingland?

279
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,863
I guess so, yeah.

280
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:48,366
And we'll actually be arriving
on my birthday.

281
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,452
- Oh, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

282
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:55,707
Yeah, Christian says
you've got this special week planned.

283
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,461
Yeah. It's sort of a crazy
nine-day festival my family's doing.

284
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,089
Lots of pageantry and special ceremonies
and dressing up.

285
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,341
That sounds fun.

286
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,843
It'll probably seem very silly.

287
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,595
But it's like theater.

288
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,722
Yeah, Christian says you're

289
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,975
you're from, like, a commune, right?

290
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,435
Yeah, we're a small community.

291
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,520
Here.

292
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,939
I'll show you.

293
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,779
I see what you mean about the pageantry.

294
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,784
Yeah, we make those clothes special
for every winter and summer solstice.

295
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,787
We... I mean, everybody sort of does
everything together.

296
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,321
That's an interesting symbol.

297
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,209
Yeah. It's our special little language.

298
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,378
Who's that one?

299
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,796
That's last year's May queen.

300
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,508
Beautiful.

301
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,679
You know,
I'm very, very glad you're coming.

302
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,891
I... I think it's very good you're coming.

303
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,185
Thank you.

304
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,313
Also, I...

305
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,106
I never had the chance to tell you,

306
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,817
but I was...

307
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,821
I was so very sorry
to hear about your loss.

308
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:11,105
What happened. I mean, I...

309
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,909
can't even imagine.

310
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,911
I mean...

311
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,746
- I lost my parents, too, so...
- Okay.

312
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,081
I kind of have some idea.

313
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,291
- I'm sorry.
- No!

314
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,668
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, you're...

315
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,962
I'm gonna just go to the bathroom.
Thank you.

316
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,972
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

317
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,017
<i>we are beginning our initial descent
into Stockholm Arlanda.</i>

318
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,144
<i>The temperature right now...</i>

319
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,279
Oh, my God, the women here.

320
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,073
What is it that makes them hotter?

321
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,265
The Vikings grabbed
all the best babes from other countries,

322
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,162
and dragged them over.

323
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,665
How long is the drive?

324
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,167
About four hours.

325
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,752
Oh, my God.

326
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,547
I saw a video,
and it wasn't even like... It wasn't fake.

327
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,134
And there was this one woman
with three clits.

328
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,260
Actually. For real.

329
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,929
...sensitive about Hiroshima?

330
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,306
I am, actually.

331
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,516
- Trail of Tears?
- Yeah.

332
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,769
- Slavery?
- Dude, what do you think?

333
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:05,313
Like, imagine
trying to take a dude seriously,

334
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,231
and he's, like, reading out the news,

335
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,485
and you know he, like,
bludgeoned his wife with a pan.

336
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,332
Why are you reading that?

337
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,069
Ask Pelle.

338
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,739
We're taught the runic alphabet
in my village,

339
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,325
so Josh just carries that around
to annoy me.

340
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,328
What are you doing your thesis on again?

341
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:07,834
Well, my focus is actually
on European midsummer traditions,

342
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:12,130
which was basically the impetus
for this whole trip that we're all on.

343
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:16,259
Hey, that sounds similar
to what you're thinking of doing, right?

344
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,677
For your thesis?

345
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,932
Well, I don't know exactly
what I'm doing it on yet, as you know.

346
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,353
But I'm thinking of rooting it
in something Scandinavian, yeah.

347
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,772
See that, Pelle?

348
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,733
You've managed to brainwash
all of your friends.

349
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:35,237
Josh was already brainwashed
when I found him.

350
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,202
Okay, this is the first stop.

351
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,064
This is it?

352
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,649
Not quite. Almost.

353
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,989
Pelle!

354
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,990
- Hey!
- Hey!

355
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,158
- Just beautiful.
- Oh, my God.

356
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,828
Okay, guys, so these are
younger people from my village.

357
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,262
They're also returning
from their trips outside.

358
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,540
Come on over.

359
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,585
Hey!

360
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,785
These are my friends from America.

361
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,674
Oh, dude.

362
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,801
Just fuckin' walk.

363
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,511
Yeah, dude, there's so many bugs.

364
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,846
- You're not seeing this?
- It's beautiful, huh?

365
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,854
Okay, so this is

366
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,314
- Mark, Dani, Christian and Josh.
- Hi.

367
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,485
What?

368
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,528
Give me just one second.

369
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,073
- You think he knows that guy?
- He sounded mad.

370
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,718
Here. Come on over. Come on over.

371
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,221
This is...
These are my great friends from America.

372
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,265
- Christian, Dani, Josh, and Mark.
- Hi.

373
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,226
Meet my brother, Ingemar.

374
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,394
Best friends since we were babies,
actually.

375
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,729
Yeah.

376
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,273
So, Christian, Josh, Mark...

377
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,108
- Dani? Yeah!
- Yeah!

378
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,277
Awesome! And say hello to my friends.

379
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,654
- This is Simon and Connie from London.
- Hi.

380
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,947
- How's it going?
- Hi.

381
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,657
Simon and Connie, this is Pelle.

382
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:30,244
And these are all the names
I just learned two seconds ago.

383
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:36,584
Perfect timing, by the way.
We just took these five minutes ago.

384
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,418
Haven't even started coming up yet.

385
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,130
Oh, shit!

386
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,050
Do you guys wanna take it now,
or should we settle in first?

387
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,052
- Fuck it. Let's just take it now, right?
- Yeah.

388
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,428
Great.

389
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,141
You know what? I might have to
find my footing first, if that's okay.

390
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,817
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah? Okay.

391
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,521
And, listen, if you're feeling uneasy,
you don't have to take them at all.

392
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,399
No, no, no.
I just... I wanna feel settled first.

393
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,484
- Okay.
- Okay.

394
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,071
- I'll wait.
- No, no, you go ahead.

395
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,364
- No, I'll wait.
- Please.

396
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,074
I want us to come up together.

397
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,492
- Ready?
- Okay?

398
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,294
Guys, I'm gonna wait for Dani,
so you just go ahead.

399
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,500
Dude,
we can't take them at different times.

400
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,284
They'll be totally separate trips.

401
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,005
You wanna wait for us then?

402
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,304
You know what? It's fine, it's fine.

403
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,014
- Babe, no.
- I'm... It's... I'm ready.

404
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,265
- No, it's okay.
- Don't feel rushed.

405
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,934
I don't. It's fine. I'm ready.

406
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,854
Are you sure?

407
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,316
Yes, Mark, thank you.

408
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,651
They've made mushroom tea.

409
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,528
If you prefer against the taste.

410
00:31:45,963 --> 00:31:47,863
Yeah, okay. I'll try that. Thank you.

411
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,990
"Ingmar"? "Ingemar."

412
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,374
- Ingemar. Perfect.
- Ingemar, okay. Thank you.

413
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,079
- Don't let Mark pressure you.
- He's not.

414
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,580
- Of all people.
- He's not, he's not.

415
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,666
It will get complicated otherwise.
It's fine.

416
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,292
- Are you ready?
- Yes, thank you.

417
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,672
There you go.

418
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,087
Thanks, dude.

419
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,297
Okay, here we go then.

420
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,549
- Think happy thoughts!
- You sure about this?

421
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,233
- Yeah, I'm excited.
- Cheers.

422
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,638
- All right.
- Yeah?

423
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,848
Are you sure about this?

424
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,932
I think it's gonna be fun.

425
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,393
- Ready?
- Yep, go.

426
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,317
What time is it?

427
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,779
It's 9:00 p.m.

428
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,074
What do you mean?

429
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,119
What do you mean?

430
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,664
That can't be right. The sky is blue.

431
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,333
It's fine. It's Sweden.

432
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,503
That's not fine. Why is it like that?

433
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,589
It's okay, Mark. It's the midnight sun.

434
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,008
That feels wrong. I don't like that.

435
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,510
I promise you, it's okay.

436
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,803
I'm not okay.

437
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,764
Oh, fuck. It's a new person.

438
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:55,848
What?

439
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,725
I don't want new people right now.

440
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,104
No, new people are good, Mark.

441
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,439
Hi, hi!

442
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,445
- I'm just gonna lay down, okay?
- Yeah, do that.

443
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,489
Everybody else lay down.

444
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,078
Guys, do it. It feels so nice.

445
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,833
Josh, can you lie down, please?

446
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,086
Can you feel that?

447
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,546
The energy,

448
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,090
coming up from the earth?

449
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:43,980
Look.

450
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,691
The trees, too, they're breathing.

451
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:58,077
Nature just knows instinctually
how to stay in harmony.

452
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,541
Everything just mechanically
doing its part.

453
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,566
You guys are, like, my family.

454
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,514
You're, like, my real, actual family.

455
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,435
Dani?

456
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,356
Sorry.

457
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,943
I'm gonna... go for a walk.

458
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,835
I can walk too.

459
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,696
Sor... No, I'm gonna...

460
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,826
No, no, no, no, no.

461
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,539
Don't think that.
You're fine. It's almost your birthday.

462
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:47,751
You're okay. You're fine.
You're fine. You're fine.

463
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,929
No, stop it! You're fine.

464
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,515
Hey, Dani!

465
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,519
How are you?

466
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,813
They were laughing at me.

467
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,233
What? No, no, no. I'm sure they weren't.

468
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,069
They've been laughing.

469
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,780
You want to come meet my friends?

470
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,287
Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you.

471
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:32,296
Stop it! Stop it. Fuck!

472
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:39,012
You're okay. You're okay. You're okay.

473
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,257
Hey.

474
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,308
How long was I asleep?

475
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,521
I mean... we found you here,
like, six hours ago.

476
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,988
Did it get dark at all?

477
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,785
For a couple hours. Not completely.

478
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,455
Is it tomorrow?

479
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,209
I mean, from yesterday's perspective.

480
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,090
Come on.

481
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,594
Where are we going?

482
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,304
Where we came for.

483
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,002
Jesus, Pelle,
where are you taking us?

484
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,389
Yeah, this is
way the hell out there.

485
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,985
Do they have ticks in Sweden?

486
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,231
Sweden has a tick problem.

487
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,400
What? No, they don't. Do they really?

488
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,194
Actually, it is a big problem.

489
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,864
Last summer a record number of people
got tick-borne encephalitis.

490
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,116
What the fuck? Are you serious?

491
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,369
Yeah,
both my grandparents died from ticks.

492
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,204
Had to give them a closed-casket funeral.

493
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,957
Okay.
Josh, I actually have an uncle with Lyme.

494
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:17,795
And believe me, you ask him, it was not
worth the pleasant picnic in the park.

495
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,880
He's fucked.

496
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,258
So this is is the place.

497
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,969
The tranquil and majestic Hårga.

498
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,588
Pelle, you know all these people?

499
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,458
These are my family.

500
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,806
So we're stopping in Waco
before going to Pelle's village?

501
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,374
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

502
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,126
- Oh, thank you.
- What is it? Strawberry?

503
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,961
- No, rhubarb.
- Thank you.

504
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,796
This bag?

505
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,006
Thank you. Sorry.

506
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,759
Hey, guys?

507
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,303
Meet my sister, Dagny.

508
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,138
Born on the exact same day as me.

509
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,058
- Hi.
- Say hi to Dani, Josh, Mark, Christian.

510
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,979
Thank you.

511
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,763
- Thanks.
- Hey.

512
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,119
Father Odd.

513
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,722
Sorry. These are my friends.

514
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,183
Christian, Dani, Josh, Mark.

515
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,644
- Hello.
- Hi.

516
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:39,811
- Hello.
- Hey.

517
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,772
- Hello, hello. Welcome, welcome.
- Hi.

518
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,441
- Hi. Oh!
- Welcome home.

519
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:48,904
- We are so very happy to have you.
- Thank you.

520
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,782
Pelle has an immaculate sense for people.

521
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,160
I love what you're wearing.

522
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,538
My frock? Quite girly, no?

523
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,542
We do these as a tribute
in respect of Ymir

524
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,961
and because of the nature's

525
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:08,341
her... "hermaphrodite," I think?
These qualities.

526
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:12,637
I think the sakhis saints
do the same thing in Brajbhoomi.

527
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,057
So, we are your hosts.

528
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,227
So whatever you need, just say so,
and we will accommodate, okay?

529
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,812
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

530
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,356
Today is all festivities

531
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:28,026
just tomorrow the official ceremony begin,
and you are welcome.

532
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,487
- Welcome. Welcome, welcome.
- Thank you.

533
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,447
Yeah. Enjoy.

534
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,367
Yes. Thank you.

535
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,954
- That guy has a very red face.
- Yeah.

536
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,585
- Do we eat these?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

537
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,529
- Can I take photos?
- Discreetly.

538
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,908
Thanks.

539
00:42:58,993 --> 00:42:59,993
Oh, forgive me.

540
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,205
I'm excluding the ones
who aren't of Swedish tongue.

541
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,250
Welcome to Hårga,

542
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,669
and happy midsummer.

543
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,715
It has been 90 years
since our last great feast,

544
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,343
and it will be 90 years before our next.

545
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:21,182
And what poetry that it's now the hottest
and brightest summer on record.

546
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,268
We already have so much to give back.

547
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:29,356
And so, without any further blathering,
let's raise our glasses.

548
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,571
And let our Nine-Day Feast commence.

549
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,322
<i>Skål!</i>

550
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,074
<i>Skål!</i>

551
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,135
You know, that fire
hasn't burned out since I was born.

552
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,887
It's all of our jobs to keep it going.

553
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:43,430
Yeah.

554
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,266
Wait, what did you say?

555
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,309
I'll tell you later.

556
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,983
He's giving thanks.

557
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,693
For the food?

558
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,695
Yeah, and the weather and the crops.

559
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,568
Was that praying?

560
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:15,123
Maybe not praying,
but he was just addressing the...

561
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,668
The everything...
The harmony and the balance.

562
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,547
Can I get a translation of what was sung?

563
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,217
Yeah, I can get a translation
from him later.

564
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,721
Yeah, thanks. That would be amazing.

565
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,181
Sure.

566
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,365
Yes. Thank you, Pelle.

567
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,144
Of course.

568
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,236
You guys should join.

569
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,447
Oh, no. I'm too scared.

570
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,540
- All right.
- Thanks, babe.

571
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,511
What are the kids playing?

572
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,255
Skin the fool.

573
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,883
- Skin the fool?
- Yeah.

574
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:49,968
Precious.

575
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,073
Hey, Pelle, can anyone just join in?

576
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,284
You're an American.
Just jam yourself in there.

577
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:19,998
Hey.

578
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,251
Happy birthday.

579
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,673
Oh, my gosh, Pelle.

580
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,165
It's just something I do for birthdays.

581
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:31,718
Maybe it's not appropriate?

582
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:35,139
No, no, no, no, not at all.
Thank you so much.

583
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,349
It's beautiful.

584
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,810
Anyway, just between us.

585
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,312
Yeah, well...

586
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,233
Christian forgot anyway,
so this is amazing. Thank you.

587
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:53,031
No, no, no, no. I forgot to remind him,
and it's not his fault. It's...

588
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,202
Never mind. It's okay.
This is... This is beautiful.

589
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,496
Thank you so much. I'm really touched.

590
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,250
So, how do you support this place?

591
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,586
Lumbering, linen, homeopathics...

592
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,130
Water power plant.

593
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,341
School time over here.

594
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,887
- Carving runes.
- Really?

595
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,724
They put it under their pillow
and dream about its powers.

596
00:50:20,206 --> 00:50:22,058
Oh, yeah. I do that too.

597
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,477
- Oh, fuck. There's a big one.
- Oh, shit.

598
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,733
What alphabet is that from?

599
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:31,028
The Younger Futhark?

600
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,154
I think. Or is that medieval?

601
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,365
Actually, that is the Elder Futhark.

602
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,116
So, how long have you two been together?

603
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,228
Oh, geez.

604
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,604
Just over three and a half years.

605
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,749
Four years.

606
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,335
- No. Really?
- Yeah.

607
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,837
Four years and two weeks.

608
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,465
You're right. I'm sorry. You're right.

609
00:50:53,228 --> 00:50:54,591
Four years.

610
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,514
Yeah. How did you guys all meet?

611
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,517
Well

612
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,811
we were all working on the same farm,

613
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:09,441
and, funny enough, I was dating Connie
when Simon and me first became pals.

614
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,084
Well, we'd been on a date.

615
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,571
And I didn't even actually know
it was a date, so...

616
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:17,740
You're right. No, no, I meant that
Connie and me had just become friends.

617
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,659
We decided to be friends.

618
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,329
And that was just before
Connie and Simon started dating.

619
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,623
And now they're engaged.

620
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,583
What?

621
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:29,795
- Congratulations.
- Which is amazing. Yes, congratulations.

622
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,965
Thanks. Yeah, we actually asked Ingemar
to officiate the wedding.

623
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,675
- Really?
- Nah.

624
00:51:36,157 --> 00:51:37,928
What's that building over there?

625
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:42,212
It's like a sacred temple,
but no one's allowed in there.

626
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,769
Let me show you where we sleep.

627
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,064
Let me show you the <i>Rotvälta.</i>

628
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,532
So we're just gonna ignore the bear then?

629
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,236
It's a bear.

630
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,659
What's that?

631
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,203
We can check it out.

632
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:14,631
A little love story.

633
00:52:54,226 --> 00:52:55,515
What?

634
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,601
Oh, man.

635
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,481
It's like painted scripture.

636
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,243
What do you think?

637
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,788
It's like another world.

638
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:23,492
Amazing.

639
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,702
Do people just sleep here?

640
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:29,831
All the younger ones, until we turn 36,
and then we move to the laborers' house.

641
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:30,916
Why 36?

642
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,418
Well, we think of life like the seasons.

643
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:36,504
So you're a child until you're 18,
and that's spring.

644
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,589
And then at some point
we all do our pilgrimage,

645
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:41,843
which is between 18 and 36,
and that's summer.

646
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,929
And then from 36 to 54,

647
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,015
we're of working age, which is fall.

648
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,727
And then finally from 54 to 72,
you become a mentor.

649
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,523
What happens at 72?

650
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,194
Not a lot of privacy.

651
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,363
Yeah, what do you do
when you need to jerk off?

652
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,824
Especially with all these dicks
on the wall. There's a lot of dicks...

653
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,909
Oh, wait, no.
We got some pussy paintings too.

654
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,745
See, man, that guy dismissed me,

655
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:12,279
but this is exactly like the sakhis saints
and the cult of Aphroditus.

656
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:23,092
Maybe you forgot or something.

657
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:26,054
- It's Dani's birthday today.
- Oh, thank you.

658
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:31,225
- Did she say something?
- No, no, no, absolutely not.

659
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,686
I just wanted
to let you know before, so...

660
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,021
Are these the May queens?

661
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,065
Yeah.

662
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,769
Right.

663
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:40,766
You'll actually be here for that.

664
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,196
And who are your May queens?

665
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,407
Every midsummer
we have this dance competition,

666
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,076
and the winner gets crowned.

667
00:54:49,425 --> 00:54:50,675
- Beautiful.
- Hey.

668
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,174
Was that...

669
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,500
You saw that too, right?

670
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,138
Pelle, who was that?

671
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,892
- Inga.
- Oh, my God, I want to give her a bath.

672
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,769
Hey, can I pull you outside for a sec?

673
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,314
Yeah, sure.

674
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,866
Pelle, tell her to come back.

First of the big ceremonies.

<i>Attestupan.</i>

What's that?

695
00:56:55,734 --> 00:56:59,332
It's too hard to explain.
You'll get a better sense tomorrow.

696
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,116
- Wait, seriously?
- You can't just tell me now?

697
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,596
Wait, you're not talking
about an actual one.

698
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,717
I mean, it's pretty actual.

699
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:10,885
Fuck.

700
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,681
Do you know what it is?

701
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,269
Dude!

702
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,397
Is it scary?

703
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,777
That is so fucking annoying.

704
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,447
Pelle, check my scalp for ticks,
then I'll check yours.

705
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:15,106
Somebody should tell those girls
they're walking stupid.

706
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,310
How long do they typically stand?

707
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,605
We're going to stand
until it's right to sit.

708
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,103
Hey.

709
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,738
These for me?

710
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,931
- You pick them backwards?
- Yeah.

711
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,847
Are those the ones?

712
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,099
Yeah.

713
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:15,368
Dude, I'm so hungry.
It's like they're trying to make it gross.

714
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,024
Dude

715
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,100
is the girl from earlier
staring at me again?

716
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,909
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

717
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:51,507
Her mother is on pilgrimage.

718
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,975
It helps them to detach.

719
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:55,294
Okay.

720
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,328
The babies are raised here by everyone.

721
01:01:58,909 --> 01:02:00,325
You want this?

722
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,327
What do you think
that guy's reaction would be

723
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,661
if I just put my finger
in his butt right now?

724
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,319
Dude, are you following them out?

725
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,113
I'm beat. I'm gonna go take a nap.

726
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,615
- Okay, yeah.
- Yeah.

727
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,243
Wait. What are we doing now?

728
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:14,488
What is that book?

729
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,366
Rubi Radr. Our scripture.

730
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,370
Can I read that?

731
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:23,706
You would not be able.

732
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,459
No!

733
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:18,464
Oh, my God!

734
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,909
- It's fine. Don't worry.
- Did she jump?

735
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:27,514
- What the...
- It's part of the ceremony.

736
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:30,142
- What? No, she fell, she fell.
- Fuck!

737
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,726
- She fell, right?
- Did she jump?

738
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:35,272
- It's okay.
- Did she fall or did she jump?

739
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,149
- She jumped, right?
- It's okay. It's fine.

740
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:40,819
What do you mean it's fine?
She's fucking dead! Look at her head!

741
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,280
- What the fuck was that?
- Look at her head! She's dead!

742
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:44,364
It's part of the ceremony.

743
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,158
Why the fuck are you all
standing there like that?

744
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,160
She just fucking jumped off the cliff.

745
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,997
Are you freaking blind? What the fuck?

746
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,086
Oh, my God.

747
01:10:58,295 --> 01:10:59,422
What the fuck?

748
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:13,436
- No, no, no.
- No, he's doing the same thing.

749
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:17,731
- He's doing the same fucking thing!
- No, no, no.

750
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,441
Someone stop!

751
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,443
Sir, don't do it. Get him to stop.

752
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:24,029
Why's everyone just standing there?
What the fuck!

753
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:29,284
- Sir, don't jump, don't jump. Get him...
- Someone please do something.

754
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,370
What the fuck? No!

755
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,438
Fuck! He's still alive!

756
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:01,322
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

757
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:20,419
He's hurt... He's fucking alive!
Call an ambulance!

758
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:22,921
Yeah, I'm not going to argue.
Please try to respect it.

759
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,256
- He's alive!
- I'm sorry.

760
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,490
- What do you mean, "respect it"?
- Oh, my God!

761
01:13:04,806 --> 01:13:06,882
Shit. Fuck, we're going.

762
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:10,010
Fuck! This is fucked!

763
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:13,221
Fuck this! You're fucked!

764
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,307
Fuck! You're all just
fucking standing there watching.

765
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,392
What the fuck is wrong with you!

766
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:22,606
- No, fucking leave her alone!
- Please, please, please listen to me.

767
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,590
- What? Explain what?
- Let me explain!

768
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,610
- Please, my poor thing.
- Fucked!

769
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:28,820
What you just saw

770
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,948
is a long, long, long-observed custom.

771
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:33,742
- Custom? It's fucked!
- Yes.

772
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:38,997
Those two who jumped have just reached
the end of their Hårga life cycle.

773
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:42,584
And you need to understand it
as a great joy for them.

774
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,920
- A joy?
- Yes, and when it is my turn,

775
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:47,339
it will be a great joy for me.

776
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:50,342
We view life as a circle.

777
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:51,468
A recycle.

778
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,888
The lady who jumped,
her name was Ylva, yes?

779
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:57,850
And that baby over there
who is not yet born

780
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:00,477
will inherit that name.

781
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:04,940
Instead of getting old
and dying in pain and fear and shame,

782
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,151
we give our life.

783
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,694
As a gesture.

784
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,864
- A gesture?
- Before it can spoil.

785
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:16,452
It does no good dying,
lashing back at the inevitable.

786
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:18,829
It corrupts the spirit.

787
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,541
I am so sorry
I didn't warn you better.

788
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:28,839
You feeling okay?

789
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:33,051
I just really need to
not be here right now.

790
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,136
Yeah.

791
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:40,684
I'm gonna go.

792
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:42,668
Just take some time to yourself, okay?

793
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:23,184
<i>Number 8...</i>

794
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:26,646
<i>A businessman in Brussels
was receiving oral sex from his secretary</i>

795
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:28,732
<i>in his car while driving on the freeway.</i>

796
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:32,068
<i>Unfortunately, he needed to make
a sudden stop and was rear-ended,</i>

797
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:34,654
<i>startling his protégée
into biting down with such...</i>

798
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:36,031
How was the thing?

799
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:43,372
<i>...brute force that his penis was severed
clean from his body.</i>

800
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:45,373
<i>Hope you enjoyed the meal</i>

801
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:47,543
What's up, man?

802
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,940
Are you getting reception here?

803
01:15:59,616 --> 01:16:01,765
I'll talk to you in...
in just a minute.

804
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:10,941
- Hey, dude.
- Hey.

805
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,861
Holy shit, right?

806
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:15,779
Are you okay?

807
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,781
Yeah, I'm fine.

808
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:19,700
Good.

809
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:27,040
Hey, listen.

810
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:31,127
I've been thinking about something
that I wanted to ask you.

811
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:33,005
Or tell you, actually.

812
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:42,305
I've been thinking a lot about my thesis,

813
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:47,227
and I've decided
I'm going to do it here, on Hårga.

814
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:53,442
And I wanted to tell you first, just so
it didn't seem like I wasn't telling you.

815
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,870
I feel like...
I feel like I can't tell if you're joking.

816
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,956
I mean, you know
I'm doing my thesis on midsummer.

817
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,040
- That's the reason why I'm here.
- Yeah.

818
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,754
Yeah, but not on this community.

819
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:17,071
I mean, you're going to Germany
and England next.

820
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:21,512
Well, you knew
I was gonna want to do this.

821
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,598
- No.
- Oh, my God.

822
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:27,976
- I mean, did you even know until just now?
- Christian, of course you did.

823
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:31,021
Okay, do you think
I don't know what you're doing?

824
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,816
It's actually kind of
outrageously unsubtle.

825
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,527
The fact that you're being
this bald about it.

826
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:39,738
I'm honestly kind of impressed.

827
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:43,158
- What the fuck, man? What does that mean?
- Yeah, what the fuck!

828
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:45,942
This is what I've been working toward,
and you know it.

829
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:48,371
That's why you look so guilty right now...
Because you know.

830
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:51,916
You know that what you're doing
is unethical and leechy and lazy,

831
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,752
and frankly it's kind of sad.

832
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:57,297
- Fuck you.
- No, dude, not fuck me.

833
01:17:57,381 --> 01:18:00,508
Find your own subject.
Or-Or your own passion.

834
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,343
And... Because... All right, look.

835
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:05,597
This... I am...
I am actually invested in this.

836
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:10,393
This is not some glorified hobby
that I'm casually dipping my feet into.

837
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:11,478
Okay.

838
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,314
In case you hadn't noticed, Your Highness,

839
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:16,107
we're doing the exact same degree.

840
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,402
No, but not in the same way, Christian!

841
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:22,781
Okay? I have to hold your little hand
through everything.

842
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:26,534
You didn't even know how to use JSTOR
until I taught you,

843
01:18:26,618 --> 01:18:28,703
and you are a fucking grad student.

844
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,622
Why are you even in academia?

845
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:34,334
You don't care! Which is fine.
That is your prerogative.

846
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:38,213
But do not appropriate my actual work
for your new shortcut.

847
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,556
I'm gonna do my thesis here.

848
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:51,807
If you're going to do it here too,
I'm open to collaborating.

849
01:18:52,936 --> 01:18:56,440
And if not, I guess we can both do
separate theses on the Hårgas.

850
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:06,324
Dude,
of all the things to let me sleep through.

851
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,409
What?

852
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:21,595
- We're leaving tomorrow morning.
- I know we are.

853
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:29,768
Sorry...

854
01:19:29,956 --> 01:19:31,474
Hi. I don't mean to disturb you...

855
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,061
Hello.

856
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:35,896
Hi, I'm Christian.

857
01:19:42,235 --> 01:19:45,238
Hello. My name is Ulla.

858
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:48,199
- Ulla.
- Ulla. And this is Maja.

859
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:49,826
Maja, hi.

860
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,204
What are you guys doing?

861
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,749
We are decorating the tree.

862
01:19:57,042 --> 01:20:00,628
Right. I was wondering
if I could ask you a question.

863
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:02,422
- Of course.
- How many...

864
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:07,385
How many times have you seen
<i>Attestupan...</i> performed?

865
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,095
<i>- "Attestupan."
- "Attestupan."</i>

866
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:10,972
How many times you've seen it performed?

867
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:16,228
Every time one reaches age, so...

868
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,522
- Okay.
- A lot.

869
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,315
Okay.

870
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:24,485
And do you have a typical...
period of grieving?

871
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:27,447
Is there a-a time when you mourn?

872
01:20:29,335 --> 01:20:32,718
We grieve and celebrate.

873
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,706
- Yes.
- Okay. I see.

874
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:37,874
I told Christian this already,

875
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,834
and now I think he's trying
to pretend like it's his idea.

876
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,711
- So if he comes up to you...
- Well, no. Wait a minute.

877
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:45,590
I seriously doubt the elders will approve
of anything being written down.

878
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:46,799
They're extremely protective.

879
01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:49,135
So then I'll just use aliases
for everything. Problem solved.

880
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:52,013
Then what would be the point?
You couldn't even get it peer-reviewed.

881
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,015
And Christian did already ask me this,
by the way.

882
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,549
And I told him the same thing
I'm telling you now.

883
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,228
I thought you said
you hadn't talked to him.

884
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:00,813
Fuck. No.

885
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:03,984
Okay, look, I'll ask the elders.
Okay? Good?

886
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:17,039
Dani?

887
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,961
I'm really sorry, Pelle. Thank you
for inviting me, but I really have to go.

888
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:24,712
Can someone maybe drive me somewhere?

889
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:26,714
I know I shouldn't have let you
stay for that.

890
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:28,716
I mean, I know it looks extreme.

891
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,552
- But we only...
- I don't know why I'm here, Pelle!

892
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:34,138
I don't know why you invited us.
I don't know why...

893
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:35,682
- I don't know why I'm here.
- Okay, okay.

894
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:37,475
- It's fine. It's okay.
- I don't know, and I can't...

895
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,477
- Come on. Come on, sit down.
- No.

896
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,688
Dani, please. Please, sit down.

897
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,441
Dani.

898
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,737
I invited my friends because
this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing,

899
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:51,114
and I wanted to share it,

900
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:54,326
especially with my friends
who I knew would appreciate it.

901
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,202
Because I...

902
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:57,662
- I am proud of this place.
- Okay.

903
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:00,415
Okay, but I'm not an anthropologist,
and I don't understand any of this.

904
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:02,291
- Yes, yes, yes. I know, I know.
- I don't get it.

905
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:05,128
And yet,
I was the most excited for you to come.

906
01:22:06,546 --> 01:22:09,341
Here. Here, smell this.

907
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:12,427
What is it?

908
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:15,528
- It calms you down.
- No. I'm fine. I don't want it.

909
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,435
- Are you sure?
- No, I-I really want to go, Pelle.

910
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:22,854
- I don't... I don't want it.
- Okay.

911
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,306
I know what you're going through, Dani.

912
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,402
What am I going through?

913
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:31,904
- Because I lost my parents too.
- What?

914
01:22:31,988 --> 01:22:35,033
No, no, Pelle.
That is not what I'm talking about.

915
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,035
- I'm not talking about my family.
- I know you're not.

916
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:38,911
- I'm talking about...
- I lost my parents as I was a little boy.

917
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:41,789
- They burned up in a fire.
- No, I wasn't talking about that.

918
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:48,255
My parents, they burned up in a fire,
and I became technically an orphan.

919
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:51,799
So believe me when I tell you
that I know what it's like.

920
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:54,261
Because I do. I really, really do.

921
01:22:57,472 --> 01:23:00,558
Yet my difference is,
I never got the chance to feel lost

922
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:03,603
because I had a family... here,

923
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:08,441
where everyone embraced me
and swept me up.

924
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:12,945
And I was raised by a community
that doesn't bicker over

925
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:15,657
what's theirs and what's not theirs.

926
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,326
That's what you were given.

927
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:21,746
But I have always felt held.

928
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:29,129
By a family. A real family...

929
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:36,052
which everyone deserves.

930
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:39,389
And you deserve.

931
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:48,481
Pelle, Christian could walk in.

932
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,192
He's what I'm talking about.

933
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:55,295
He's my good friend,
and I like him, but...

934
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,075
Dani, do you feel held by him?

935
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:03,997
Does he feel like home to you?

936
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:47,207
Hey. How you doing?

937
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:50,085
Today was tough.

938
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:54,923
Are you going to be okay?

939
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,886
Are you not disturbed by what we just saw?

940
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,264
Yeah, of course I am.

941
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,934
That was really, really shocking.

942
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:10,011
I'm trying to keep an open mind though.

943
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,525
That's cultural, you know?

944
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:18,738
We stick our elders in nursing homes.
I'm sure they find that disturbing.

945
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:23,618
Hello.

946
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:28,123
Would you like to be joining us
with a special ceremony?

947
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:31,542
Why? What's happening now?

948
01:27:58,606 --> 01:27:59,858
What's happening?

949
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,282
What's happening?

950
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:15,164
No, wait, wait. Stop!

951
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:56,705
Okay, can you slow down?
Just wait a sec, babe.

952
01:28:56,789 --> 01:28:59,917
Please, Christian,
this is feeling really wrong.

953
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,377
We need to leave.

954
01:29:02,545 --> 01:29:04,380
I know that this is weird,

955
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:05,798
- but it's because it's alien.
- No...

956
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:08,300
We haven't been exposed
to anything like this.

957
01:29:08,384 --> 01:29:11,429
No, Christian. This is completely
backwards. We need to leave.

958
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:14,807
- We just need to acclimate.
- I don't want to acclimate. I want to go.

959
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:17,018
Well, I can't. I'm sorry. Period.

960
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:20,271
I'm doing my thesis on this.

961
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,773
What? Since when?

962
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:24,734
Since I decided today.

963
01:29:25,568 --> 01:29:28,195
You know how much of a nightmare
this has been for me to figure out.

964
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:30,948
And I've made the mistake of telling Josh,
and now he's competing with me.

965
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:34,160
So if he wants it, let him have it.
We need to leave.

966
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:39,374
Can you not see what's going on here?
This level of tradition?

967
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,918
No one's seen this.
No one's written anything on it.

968
01:29:43,002 --> 01:29:44,962
And they've invited us to be a part of it.

969
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:48,132
- Can't you see what a privilege that is?
- Why have they invited us?

970
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:49,842
- Because Pelle did.
- Why did Pelle?

971
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:52,376
- Because he trusts us.
- Why would they trust us?

972
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:55,681
You're opportunistic
anthropology students.

973
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:57,683
Maybe because we're anthropology students.

974
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:58,767
- Oh, my God.
- Maybe they want

975
01:29:58,851 --> 01:30:01,401
- someone to document this.
- Are you fucking blind?

976
01:30:01,604 --> 01:30:04,982
They're doing pagan rituals.
People are jumping off cliffs.

977
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,735
They depend
on no one knowing about this ever.

978
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:09,696
Not necessarily.

979
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:14,576
Okay. I want to leave.

980
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:19,914
Okay, then you can leave. But I'm staying.

981
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:24,794
I invited you, and I don't regret that,
but I'm here for a reason.

982
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:34,512
Do you not love me anymore?

983
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:44,195
What does that have to do with this?

984
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:46,732
We're in the devaluation phase.

985
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:49,693
We've been in it for a long time,
and next comes discard.

986
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:53,864
Can we spare our relationship
your textbook psychology keywords?

987
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:56,367
We've been in this for a while.

988
01:30:56,826 --> 01:30:59,626
You've been trying to pull away,
and I've been in denial.

989
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:08,755
Please. Give yourself some credit, babe.

990
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,966
Looks like
you've got this all figured out.

991
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:14,010
What?

992
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:18,746
Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna say one thing.

993
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:24,812
When you casually gift me
an impromptu bouquet of flowers,

994
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:26,397
- that just makes me think...
- What flowers?

995
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,781
...how and when
am I supposed to pay that back?

996
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:31,277
Everything you give me is a reminder

997
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:34,061
that I'm not doing enough for you
in this relationship.

998
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:35,990
What, at lunch?

999
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:39,243
I picked those on a whim!

1000
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,829
Oh, don't try to tell me
that you had no ulterior motive.

1001
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:43,706
- Yeah! What motives do I have?
- On your birthday?

1002
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:46,334
The day after I didn't get you something?

1003
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:49,504
Are you being serious?

1004
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:53,549
Okay, fine.

1005
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:55,843
Play the wounded party again.

1006
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:00,097
You're just a self-denying altruist,
and I'm a paranoid dick.

1007
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:02,141
You don't have a conniving bone
in your body.

1008
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:05,186
- What is it you imagine I'm conniving?
- You are, Dani!

1009
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:09,064
I feel locked into your debt every time
you do something "just because."

1010
01:32:09,148 --> 01:32:11,692
- I don't keep you in my debt!
- Because it's never "just because."

1011
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:13,152
I was being kind.

1012
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:14,695
Okay, fine. I'm the asshole.

1013
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,072
- Nobody's the asshole.
- I clearly am.

1014
01:32:17,156 --> 01:32:22,119
You selflessly gave me flowers,
and I feel trapped. Fuck!

1015
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:23,871
Are you actually gonna leave?

1016
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:27,772
- I'm supposed to be working here.
- You're gonna leave me like this?

1017
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:29,585
Christian!

1018
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:43,725
Hey, do you... Sorry.

1019
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:46,435
Do you have a sleeping pill I can take?

1020
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:48,396
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

1021
01:33:15,563 --> 01:33:17,399
You're going to wake her up.

1022
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:20,191
Yo, Pelle!

1023
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:36,832
Whatcha doin'?

1024
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:40,044
Just working in the garden.

1025
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:47,218
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

1026
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:49,053
Any word?

1027
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:51,889
Yeah. They say you can do it.

1028
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:54,474
As long as you absolutely
don't use any names or...

1029
01:36:54,558 --> 01:36:56,852
- Okay.
- ...the location is never even hinted at.

1030
01:36:56,936 --> 01:36:57,936
Okay.

1031
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:00,220
And you'll have to sign
an agreement to that.

1032
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:04,407
And you're splitting it with Christian
because he came to me first.

1033
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:08,238
Well, that's... We'll figure that out.

1034
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:09,365
I got to go take a leak.

1035
01:37:10,677 --> 01:37:12,159
Here, can I ask you something?

1036
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:13,368
Yeah.

1037
01:37:13,452 --> 01:37:16,080
Do you know what this is?

1038
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:19,208
I found it under Christian's bed.

1039
01:37:21,373 --> 01:37:24,338
That's a love rune.
Casts a love spell.

1040
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:26,048
A love rune.

1041
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:27,133
Yeah.

1042
01:37:27,883 --> 01:37:29,733
- Under Christian's bed?
- Yeah, yeah.

1043
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:33,431
What's going on?

1044
01:37:34,749 --> 01:37:36,516
The elders said you can do your thesis

1045
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,250
as long as you don't use
the actual names or location.

1046
01:37:40,062 --> 01:37:41,188
Are you serious?

1047
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:42,273
Yeah.

1048
01:37:42,898 --> 01:37:47,277
Oh, my God. Thank you, man.
That is incredible news. Thank you.

1049
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:49,196
Great.
You're splitting it with Josh as well.

1050
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,830
Yeah, I already told him
I'm totally fine with that.

1051
01:37:52,324 --> 01:37:55,786
Good. Well, I think my sister, Maja,
has taken a liking to you.

1052
01:37:57,621 --> 01:37:58,789
- Yeah?
- Yep.

1053
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:00,624
The redhead?

1054
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:04,754
And actually she just got
<i>byxmyndig</i> last year.

1055
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:12,428
It basically means that you are allowed
to have sex when you're 15. Pan's license.

1056
01:38:13,095 --> 01:38:15,848
Okay, good for her.

1057
01:38:24,106 --> 01:38:26,484
What? Okay, relax, relax. What did I do?

1058
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:30,362
- Pelle, what is going on?
- What happened?

1059
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:36,243
What did I do? What did I do wrong?

1060
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:40,497
Dude, okay! Relax!

1061
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,457
You pissed on the ancestral tree.

1062
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:43,792
- The tree? So what?
- Yes, yes.

1063
01:38:43,876 --> 01:38:44,877
"So what"!

1064
01:38:45,961 --> 01:38:47,462
- I didn't know.
- No, it's...

1065
01:38:47,546 --> 01:38:49,632
That tree is tied to all of our dead.

1066
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:52,926
It's a dead tree though. It's dead.

1067
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:54,928
Yeah, yeah, I know.
But it's important to us.

1068
01:38:55,012 --> 01:38:57,180
I just had to pee.
I didn't know it was special.

1069
01:38:57,264 --> 01:39:00,267
No, I know. We know that
you didn't know that, but it's just...

1070
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:03,562
- Well, how was I supposed to know...
- You wouldn't pee on a gravestone, right?

1071
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:05,063
Obviously not, but...

1072
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:09,943
- Fuck! I mean...
- What did you do to him?

1073
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:12,777
I don't know what I'm apologizing for...
Do I apologize?

1074
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:14,615
Apologize later.

1075
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:17,785
- Okay.
- Oh, shit. Hi.

1076
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:27,475
- Okay.
- What the fuck!

1077
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:33,384
What did she say?

1078
01:39:34,009 --> 01:39:36,219
She said it's gonna be okay,

1079
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:39,848
and she'll talk to Ulf
and apologize for the mistake.

1080
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:42,351
Seriously? What else did she say?

1081
01:39:54,613 --> 01:39:55,614
Hey.

1082
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:56,782
Hi.

1083
01:39:57,491 --> 01:39:58,951
You get some good sleep?

1084
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:02,371
Good.

1085
01:40:03,289 --> 01:40:04,748
What happened over there?

1086
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,626
Mark's... just...

1087
01:40:23,225 --> 01:40:24,685
I'm sorry about last night.

1088
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:26,812
How are you feeling?

1089
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:33,083
I don't want us to be fighting, Christian.

1090
01:40:34,069 --> 01:40:35,070
Well

1091
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:37,698
me neither.

1092
01:41:09,271 --> 01:41:10,522
Hey.

1093
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:12,649
Hey. It was really nice to meet you.

1094
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:15,193
I'm so sorry. We're actually leaving.

1095
01:41:15,277 --> 01:41:16,278
What?

1096
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:18,405
- Yeah.
- Connie.

1097
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:20,574
Simon is getting the truck
with one of them now.

1098
01:41:20,658 --> 01:41:22,508
- Connie.
- Is everything okay?

1099
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:25,120
Connie.

1100
01:41:26,288 --> 01:41:27,289
Oh, there.

1101
01:41:28,341 --> 01:41:33,461
Simon, he told me to tell you
that Jan drove him to the train station.

1102
01:41:33,545 --> 01:41:38,508
And after Simon gets dropped off,
he's sending the truck back for you.

1103
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:39,593
What?

1104
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:42,221
You will meet him there.

1105
01:41:42,888 --> 01:41:47,142
No. Why would he just go without me?
He wouldn't do that.

1106
01:41:47,893 --> 01:41:50,145
Well, the truck only had room for two.

1107
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:55,150
What does that mean?

1108
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:57,944
That doesn't even make any sense.
He would have told me.

1109
01:41:58,028 --> 01:42:00,363
Today's only train leaves in 90 minutes.

1110
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:02,782
It takes about 35 minutes
to go there and back.

1111
01:42:02,866 --> 01:42:04,566
So they didn't want to waste time.

1112
01:42:05,744 --> 01:42:07,329
So I could have sat on his lap.

1113
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:12,710
Yes, I imagine that too, but, you know,
we don't break traffic laws, okay?

1114
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,298
So they've just gone.
They've left me just now.

1115
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:21,134
Now, Connie,
there was no room in the truck.

1116
01:42:21,218 --> 01:42:24,471
Yet it is coming right back for you. Yeah?

1117
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:29,059
This is bullshit.

1118
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:40,696
Okay, lunch in a bit.

1119
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:03,677
And how are... jobs or roles assigned?

1120
01:43:04,386 --> 01:43:06,430
That's based on traits we show as kids.

1121
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:11,309
For example, he was assigned to protect.

1122
01:43:11,393 --> 01:43:13,437
So he made his pilgrimage as doctor.

1123
01:43:15,397 --> 01:43:16,648
Is he gonna be okay?

1124
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:19,401
I mean...

1125
01:43:19,485 --> 01:43:22,196
Yeah, he's a very sensitive guy.

1126
01:43:22,821 --> 01:43:24,198
It's a big week for him.

1127
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,117
- Hey.
- Hi. Sorry.

1128
01:43:29,532 --> 01:43:31,163
Simon left without Connie.

1129
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:33,540
Jesus, really?

1130
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,459
- Yeah.
- What a dick move.

1131
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:39,045
- Is she okay?
- No.

1132
01:43:39,129 --> 01:43:40,297
- She just got told.
- Did she say why?

1133
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:41,382
No, no.

1134
01:43:42,674 --> 01:43:43,884
That sucks.

1135
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:49,462
On the... On the subject
of couples, actually...

1136
01:43:51,016 --> 01:43:53,477
is there ever an issue here with incest?

1137
01:43:55,729 --> 01:43:58,357
Sorry. I mean, you know...
small communities.

1138
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:02,861
Well, the bloodlines
are very well preserved.

1139
01:44:02,945 --> 01:44:04,655
So the elders must approve mates.

1140
01:44:05,531 --> 01:44:10,702
Cousins can sometimes mate.
But we do respect the incest taboo.

1141
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:13,372
So we often need to...

1142
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:16,792
We often need to invite outside peoples.

1143
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:38,313
Excuse me. Hey.

1144
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:41,275
Would you like to help join us?

1145
01:44:45,571 --> 01:44:46,571
Sure, yeah.

1146
01:44:46,655 --> 01:44:47,656
Come.

1147
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:50,853
Do you... Do you know...

1148
01:44:51,244 --> 01:44:53,153
Have you seen Simon anywhere?

1149
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:57,249
Yes. He was driven to the station.
Did you not say good-bye?

1150
01:44:57,833 --> 01:45:02,129
No. No, I didn't.
But that's okay, that's okay.

1151
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:03,881
Hi.

1152
01:45:08,844 --> 01:45:10,044
What are we making here?

1153
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:11,513
Meat tarts.

1154
01:45:14,661 --> 01:45:15,856
Thank you.

1155
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:19,855
She says you're so beautiful.

1156
01:45:21,451 --> 01:45:22,649
Thank you.

1157
01:45:23,201 --> 01:45:24,776
She's so beautiful.

1158
01:45:44,129 --> 01:45:48,133
We describe it like emotional sheet music.

1159
01:45:48,217 --> 01:45:49,634
What does it say?

1160
01:45:49,718 --> 01:45:55,265
Well, each runic letter stands for
one of the 16 <i>affekts,</i>

1161
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:58,435
which are graded from
most holy to most unholy.

1162
01:45:59,019 --> 01:46:01,563
This one, for example, is about grief.

1163
01:46:02,648 --> 01:46:06,818
You can see at the end, however,
we have blank pages.

1164
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:12,949
This is because the Rubi Radr
is a work forever in progress.

1165
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:16,828
Forever evolving.
We have many, many hundreds of these.

1166
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:21,583
And who decides what gets added?

1167
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:26,547
Well, this iteration
is being written by Ruben.

1168
01:46:31,346 --> 01:46:32,800
The disabled...

1169
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:34,513
Since birth.

1170
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:38,684
He draws, and we the Elders interpret.

1171
01:46:40,602 --> 01:46:44,690
You see, Josh,
Ruben is unclouded by normal cognition.

1172
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,193
It makes him open for the source.

1173
01:46:50,789 --> 01:46:55,325
What happens when Ruben... dies?

1174
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:58,120
Do you just wait for a baby that is...

1175
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:01,456
not clouded?

1176
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:06,211
No, no, no.
Ruben was a product of inbreeding.

1177
01:47:06,795 --> 01:47:10,549
All of our oracles
are deliberate products of inbreeding.

1178
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:15,679
Can I take a photograph?

1179
01:47:17,347 --> 01:47:18,348
What?

1180
01:47:19,653 --> 01:47:21,267
- A photograph?
- No.

1181
01:47:21,351 --> 01:47:23,478
- Absolutely not.
- Okay, sorry.

1182
01:47:24,062 --> 01:47:26,189
Absolutely not.

1183
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:52,966
Oh, fuck. Yep, that's her.

1184
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:01,725
Hey.

1185
01:48:09,909 --> 01:48:11,566
Great. She's walking away.

1186
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:32,923
Thank you.

1187
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:41,139
Thanks.

1188
01:48:41,223 --> 01:48:42,224
<i>Tack.</i>

1189
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:43,767
Thanks.

1190
01:48:49,981 --> 01:48:51,316
Has anyone seen Connie?

1191
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:55,310
I think Mark saw her earlier.

1192
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:59,449
I'm sure I saw her trying out
for the sprinting Olympics earlier.

1193
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:02,160
- What? Where?
- Sorry, but I can say what happened.

1194
01:49:02,828 --> 01:49:04,871
Her boyfriend called
the landline from the train station

1195
01:49:04,955 --> 01:49:06,164
and calmed Connie down.

1196
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:09,490
Then she begged our pardon
and I drove her to meet him.

1197
01:49:12,754 --> 01:49:16,133
- Okay. Well, that's a relief.
- Why would Simon leave without her?

1198
01:49:17,968 --> 01:49:19,968
I'm sure it was just a miscommunication.

1199
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:39,120
I could see you possibly doing that.

1200
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:46,028
What the hell does that mean?

1201
01:49:52,294 --> 01:49:53,295
Never mind.

1202
01:50:00,552 --> 01:50:03,096
Someone's still sore
about their ancestral tree.

1203
01:50:09,227 --> 01:50:10,854
Dude, is he gonna kill me?

1204
01:50:14,065 --> 01:50:16,165
Did you learn anything
about the Rubi Radr?

1205
01:50:22,657 --> 01:50:24,117
Oh, so now you want to collaborate?

1206
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:25,743
Okay, thank you.

1207
01:50:25,827 --> 01:50:26,911
- I know that one elder...
- Thank you.

1208
01:50:26,995 --> 01:50:30,245
- ...gave you a glimpse of it.
- Thank you. Sorry I brought it up.

1209
01:50:53,605 --> 01:50:55,607
Oh, my God, dude. What the fuck?

1210
01:50:56,733 --> 01:50:58,401
- Is that...
- What is that?

1211
01:50:58,485 --> 01:51:00,027
Is that a fucking pube?

1212
01:51:00,407 --> 01:51:01,487
It's just a hair.

1213
01:51:01,571 --> 01:51:02,781
Yeah, a pubic hair.

1214
01:51:03,573 --> 01:51:05,366
Dude, calm down.

1215
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:09,162
Why are you embarrassed? You're not
the one giving out... hair pies.

1216
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:31,790
Jesus Christ.
He's still fucking lookin' at me.

1217
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:34,354
Hey. You'll come with me?

1218
01:51:35,981 --> 01:51:37,440
- What?
- You'll come?

1219
01:51:38,738 --> 01:51:39,948
I'll show you.

1220
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:41,652
Okay, sure.

1221
01:51:41,736 --> 01:51:43,988
- Yeah?
- Yeah, great.

1222
01:51:46,111 --> 01:51:48,462
I'll be back.
I guess she's going to show me.

1223
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:13,518
Hey, can I borrow
another sleeping pill?

1224
01:52:13,602 --> 01:52:15,103
- Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Thanks.

1225
01:52:18,023 --> 01:52:19,024
Thank you.

1226
01:54:08,675 --> 01:54:10,051
What the fuck, Mark?

1227
01:54:10,677 --> 01:54:14,527
What the fuck are you doing? Close the
door! We're not supposed to be in here.

1228
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:13,479
Do you think
Mark's still off with that girl?

1229
01:55:14,407 --> 01:55:15,658
I wouldn't be surprised.

1230
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:20,413
What about Josh, though?

1231
01:55:20,497 --> 01:55:22,290
I'm honestly not too concerned.

1232
01:55:26,086 --> 01:55:31,216
We... have something regretful
to announce.

1233
01:55:31,966 --> 01:55:37,806
This morning the 19th Book of Rubi Radr
was found missing from the temple.

1234
01:55:39,349 --> 01:55:42,226
We don't want to point fingers,

1235
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:46,647
yet we kindly ask that whoever took it
to return it to its original place.

1236
01:55:46,731 --> 01:55:48,482
You can leave it in the temple,

1237
01:55:48,566 --> 01:55:50,693
which will be left unguarded
and unwatched.

1238
01:55:51,528 --> 01:55:54,239
Nobody needs to know it was you.

1239
01:56:07,335 --> 01:56:08,794
Where is your friend, Josh?

1240
01:56:08,878 --> 01:56:11,923
I know. We have no idea.

1241
01:56:12,590 --> 01:56:17,428
He and your other friend,
they both disappears the same day.

1242
01:56:19,222 --> 01:56:20,222
You see how it looks?

1243
01:56:20,306 --> 01:56:23,392
Yes, obviously. But I swear to you
we are in the dark on this.

1244
01:56:23,476 --> 01:56:25,176
We're just as confused as you are.

1245
01:56:26,896 --> 01:56:29,296
We did see Mark go off
with that girl last night.

1246
01:56:30,191 --> 01:56:32,151
- What girl?
- Inga.

1247
01:56:32,235 --> 01:56:33,861
Yeah, but Mark wouldn't have done this.

1248
01:56:33,945 --> 01:56:35,245
Josh, on the other hand

1249
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:38,240
he came to bed with us,
and when we woke up he was gone.

1250
01:56:38,324 --> 01:56:41,035
And if he did take that book,
I just pray you understand

1251
01:56:41,119 --> 01:56:45,456
we don't associate as friends of his
or collaborators or anything.

1252
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:47,958
We would just be so embarrassed
to be connected to this

1253
01:56:48,042 --> 01:56:49,419
in any way, shape or form.

1254
01:56:51,504 --> 01:56:53,923
Let's hope it gets returned.

1255
01:56:54,799 --> 01:56:55,925
I hope so too.

1256
01:56:56,009 --> 01:56:57,302
I feel responsible.

1257
01:56:58,052 --> 01:57:00,930
Well, you and Odd,
you can go looking for them.

1258
01:57:01,014 --> 01:57:02,932
- Yes.
- Maybe you can redeem this.

1259
01:57:05,018 --> 01:57:08,521
You are going with the women
for the day's activity.

1260
01:57:08,605 --> 01:57:10,022
Oh, hi.

1261
01:57:10,106 --> 01:57:12,942
And Siv wants to see you in her house.

1262
01:57:20,825 --> 01:57:22,202
Okay?

1263
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:24,120
Okay.

1264
01:57:25,788 --> 01:57:26,789
Okay.

1265
01:58:08,164 --> 01:58:09,374
This is the big one.

1266
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:12,293
Okay. Thank you.

1267
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:17,631
Look into her eyes.

1268
01:58:20,266 --> 01:58:22,313
Can I ask what this is exactly?

1269
01:58:23,179 --> 01:58:26,266
It's... tea for the competition.

1270
01:58:32,397 --> 01:58:35,692
And then you... glass here.

1271
01:58:37,652 --> 01:58:39,111
And then we drink it.

1272
01:58:39,195 --> 01:58:40,446
- Okay?
- Okay.

1273
01:58:41,781 --> 01:58:42,782
Okay.

1274
01:58:51,082 --> 01:58:52,667
- Oh, God.
- Here we go.

1275
02:00:55,581 --> 02:00:56,833
Please. Come in.

1276
02:01:50,428 --> 02:01:54,181
Firstly, I just have to say
I have no idea where Josh is.

1277
02:01:54,265 --> 02:01:56,433
And I can swear to that
on my mother's life.

1278
02:01:56,517 --> 02:01:58,102
How do you feel about Maja?

1279
02:02:03,065 --> 02:02:04,358
About Maja?

1280
02:02:10,656 --> 02:02:12,408
How do I feel about her how?

1281
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:14,994
You have been approved to mate with her.

1282
02:02:15,912 --> 02:02:18,956
You're an ideal astrological match.

1283
02:02:19,999 --> 02:02:22,084
And she has fixed her hopes on you.

1284
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:28,172
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

1285
02:02:30,551 --> 02:02:32,470
I haven't even spoken to her.

1286
02:02:33,679 --> 02:02:36,140
She fixed on you before you came.

1287
02:02:36,224 --> 02:02:38,351
Pelle showed her a photo.

1288
02:02:46,526 --> 02:02:48,569
I'm here with someone.

1289
02:02:48,653 --> 02:02:50,195
I'm here with Dani.

1290
02:02:50,279 --> 02:02:51,781
Dani will not know.

1291
02:02:53,407 --> 02:02:55,368
I am not proposing marriage.

1292
02:02:56,661 --> 02:02:58,412
You wouldn't be approved for that.

1293
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:03,626
Okay, so what is it you're asking?

1294
02:03:05,086 --> 02:03:08,130
I'm asking if you care to mate with Maja.

1295
02:03:08,881 --> 02:03:10,341
It's a one-night offer.

1296
02:03:18,808 --> 02:03:21,101
I think I ate one of her pubic hairs.

1297
02:03:21,497 --> 02:03:23,286
Sounds probably right.

1298
02:03:25,523 --> 02:03:27,774
From an academic perspective

1299
02:03:27,858 --> 02:03:32,154
it would also provide a unique glimpse
into our sexual rites.

1300
02:03:38,953 --> 02:03:42,081
Can I not have a unique glimpse
without participating?

1301
02:04:33,633 --> 02:04:34,800
- Stay here.
- What?

1302
02:04:35,718 --> 02:04:36,719
Are you ready?

1303
02:04:37,595 --> 02:04:39,263
- What are we doing?
- You'll see.

1304
02:05:55,589 --> 02:05:57,883
- You're so good.
- What does that mean?

1305
02:05:57,967 --> 02:05:59,468
- Eight, eight!
- What?

1306
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:00,969
We're now eight left!

1307
02:06:24,034 --> 02:06:25,827
Christian?

1308
02:06:26,668 --> 02:06:27,950
For you?

1309
02:06:30,082 --> 02:06:31,917
Thanks.

1310
02:06:32,668 --> 02:06:34,253
- What is it?
- It's...

1311
02:06:34,879 --> 02:06:36,297
Sorry.

1312
02:06:37,339 --> 02:06:42,178
Spring water with special properties.

1313
02:06:45,848 --> 02:06:46,849
Okay.

1314
02:06:48,476 --> 02:06:49,726
What does it do?

1315
02:06:51,604 --> 02:06:55,399
It breaks down your defenses

1316
02:06:55,483 --> 02:06:58,986
and opens you for the influence.

1317
02:07:00,362 --> 02:07:01,363
Okay.

1318
02:07:03,115 --> 02:07:04,158
Thanks.

1319
02:07:05,117 --> 02:07:06,118
You're welcome.

1320
02:07:07,745 --> 02:07:08,788
You know what?

1321
02:07:09,872 --> 02:07:11,456
I'm worried I'll have a bad trip.

1322
02:07:11,540 --> 02:07:14,084
Oh, no. You won't. You won't. Trust me.

1323
02:08:58,564 --> 02:09:00,065
I don't speak Swedish.

1324
02:09:00,149 --> 02:09:01,525
What?

1325
02:09:40,564 --> 02:09:41,764
What's happening?

1326
02:09:44,234 --> 02:09:47,279
You are our May queen.

1327
02:09:48,197 --> 02:09:49,447
- Me?
- Yes.

1328
02:09:49,531 --> 02:09:50,991
- Why?
- You won!

1329
02:09:52,701 --> 02:09:53,911
What does that mean?

1330
02:09:54,995 --> 02:09:55,996
Oh, my God.

1331
02:10:45,421 --> 02:10:47,256
Mom? Mom?

1332
02:10:49,258 --> 02:10:52,219
Oh, my God, Dani! May queen!

1333
02:13:30,252 --> 02:13:31,253
Herring?

1334
02:13:32,045 --> 02:13:33,088
What for?

1335
02:13:34,506 --> 02:13:36,216
It's tradition. For good luck.

1336
02:13:36,967 --> 02:13:37,968
Yeah!

1337
02:13:38,552 --> 02:13:39,552
What?

1338
02:13:39,636 --> 02:13:41,262
And you must eat it whole.

1339
02:13:41,346 --> 02:13:43,473
- But the tails go in first.
- No, no, no.

1340
02:13:44,683 --> 02:13:47,227
You must try! You must try!

1341
02:13:49,688 --> 02:13:51,440
Aww.

1342
02:13:58,113 --> 02:14:00,240
A very good try.

1343
02:14:03,368 --> 02:14:04,661
Excuse me?

1344
02:14:05,829 --> 02:14:06,830
What's going on?

1345
02:14:16,506 --> 02:14:17,799
Why did you do that?

1346
02:14:25,057 --> 02:14:26,850
To our May queen!

1347
02:14:28,393 --> 02:14:30,311
<i>Välkommen! Skål!</i>

1348
02:14:30,395 --> 02:14:32,272
<i>Skål!</i>

1349
02:14:44,284 --> 02:14:45,869
You are in the family now. Yes?

1350
02:14:46,703 --> 02:14:48,205
Yes, you are in the family.

1351
02:14:49,081 --> 02:14:50,082
Like sisters.

1352
02:16:24,926 --> 02:16:29,931
Now it's traditional for the May queen
to bless our crops and livestock.

1353
02:16:31,725 --> 02:16:35,687
And after the luck you just inherited
from that salt herring,

1354
02:16:35,771 --> 02:16:38,398
we should all be doubly encouraged.

1355
02:16:51,953 --> 02:16:53,413
Can Christian come with me?

1356
02:16:54,414 --> 02:16:55,623
Nay.

1357
02:16:55,707 --> 02:16:57,042
The queen must ride alone.

1358
02:19:54,803 --> 02:19:56,179
So repeat after me?

1359
02:20:42,726 --> 02:20:43,727
Breathe in.

1360
02:20:47,063 --> 02:20:48,607
For your vitality.

1361
02:25:16,916 --> 02:25:18,668
We shall go now to Siv's house.

1362
02:25:19,460 --> 02:25:20,669
What's this?

1363
02:25:20,753 --> 02:25:23,172
It's a special meeting,
only for the queens.

1364
02:25:23,798 --> 02:25:25,216
She will bless you.

1365
02:25:29,053 --> 02:25:30,304
What's that?

1366
02:25:30,388 --> 02:25:31,514
That's not for us.

1367
02:25:37,395 --> 02:25:38,646
I think you should not.

1368
02:27:28,089 --> 02:27:29,340
No, no, no.

1369
02:32:33,602 --> 02:32:34,603
Christian?

1370
02:32:36,689 --> 02:32:37,690
Christian.

1371
02:32:40,818 --> 02:32:41,819
Hi.

1372
02:32:43,446 --> 02:32:45,072
Hello. There you are.

1373
02:32:45,948 --> 02:32:50,453
Listen. You can't speak. You can't move.

1374
02:32:51,704 --> 02:32:52,705
All right?

1375
02:32:53,831 --> 02:32:54,832
Good.

1376
02:33:05,217 --> 02:33:10,264
On this,
the day of our deity of reciprocity,

1377
02:33:10,348 --> 02:33:15,019
we gather to give special thanks
to our treasured sun.

1378
02:33:15,978 --> 02:33:22,610
As an offering to our father,
we will today surrender nine human lives.

1379
02:33:24,028 --> 02:33:27,823
As Hårga takes, so Hårga also gives.

1380
02:33:28,616 --> 02:33:33,287
Thus, for every new blood sacrificed,

1381
02:33:33,371 --> 02:33:36,540
we will dedicate one of our own.

1382
02:33:37,917 --> 02:33:43,089
That is four new bloods. Four from Hårga.

1383
02:33:44,340 --> 02:33:47,093
And one to be chosen by the queen.

1384
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:50,388
Nine in all to die

1385
02:33:51,055 --> 02:33:54,308
and be reborn in the great cycle.

1386
02:33:55,810 --> 02:33:59,021
The four new bloods
have already been supplied.

1387
02:33:59,939 --> 02:34:04,026
As for our end,
we have two already dedicated...

1388
02:34:07,905 --> 02:34:11,117
and two who have volunteered.

1389
02:34:11,784 --> 02:34:13,911
Ingemar and Ulf.

1390
02:34:17,456 --> 02:34:20,376
You have brought outside offerings.

1391
02:34:21,085 --> 02:34:23,963
Thus volunteering your own bodies.

1392
02:34:25,172 --> 02:34:27,299
You will today be joined

1393
02:34:27,383 --> 02:34:29,218
in harmony with everything.

1394
02:34:30,719 --> 02:34:36,684
And to Pelle, who has brought
new blood and our new May queen,

1395
02:34:37,393 --> 02:34:41,188
you will today be honored
for your unclouded intuition.

1396
02:34:42,565 --> 02:34:45,860
And so for our ninth offering

1397
02:34:47,486 --> 02:34:50,614
it is traditional
that our fair queen shall choose

1398
02:34:50,698 --> 02:34:56,203
between a preselected new blood
and a specially ordained Hårgan.

1399
02:35:23,063 --> 02:35:24,482
Torbjorn.

1400
02:35:25,441 --> 02:35:28,694
Honorable Torbjorn, please step forward.

1401
02:35:33,407 --> 02:35:34,408
And...

1402
02:35:53,135 --> 02:35:54,803
Christian Hughes.

1403
02:35:58,182 --> 02:36:02,269
These are the candidates
for the ninth and final offering.

1404
02:36:03,979 --> 02:36:06,815
We patiently await your verdict.
