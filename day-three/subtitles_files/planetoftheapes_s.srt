2
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:18,244
You lose.

3
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:20,580
Again.

4
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,127
I changed your flight sequence.

5
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:28,213
That's enough.

6
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:29,964
Pay attention.

7
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:32,425
Pericles, stop! Or no treat!

8
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:38,139
How well do I know you?

9
00:05:19,263 --> 00:05:21,265
Hey, there you are.

10
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:24,769
Was the homo sapien mean to you?

11
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:27,397
We all know it's just rocket envy.

12
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:31,401
- Ever consider a boyfriend?
- Do I enjoy being miserable?

13
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:33,903
- I'll stick with my chimps.
Hey.

14
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,911
- I'm teaching him.
- You're teasing him.

15
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,124
He's gene-spliced, chromosome-
enhanced. He can handle it.

16
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:51,170
When you frustrate them, they lose
focus. They even get violent.

17
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:54,507
Hey, Pericles,
you're gonna be a daddy.

18
00:05:55,425 --> 00:06:00,304
- Thought I saw a smirk on his face.
- The female was the aggressor.

19
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:02,807
Hey, Leo. You got a postcard.

20
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:07,937
<i>Leo!</i>

21
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:12,608
<i>It's been two years.
When are you coming home?</i>

22
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:15,653
<i>Not too quick.
I'm enjoying that apartment.</i>

23
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:18,614
<i>- No, we miss you!
- Are you flying yet?</i>

24
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:23,786
<i>- Or are the chimps doing the work?
- We got something to tell you.</i>

25
00:06:25,663 --> 00:06:28,624
<i>When you gonna make
that kind of commitment...</i>

26
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:57,612
<i>Captain Davidson,
report to the bridge.</i>

27
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:09,749
Found it.
It's moving like a storm.

28
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:12,752
It is. It's an electromagnetic storm.

29
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,714
The digital clocks are stopped.
It's beautiful.

30
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:20,384
- So is the sun till you get close.
This is weird.

31
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:24,430
I hear frequency patterns.
- Tune them in.

32
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:30,144
It's electronic communication
from Earth, from all time.

33
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:33,147
The storm's bouncing it back to us.

34
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:37,735
We'll start with a pass
through the core.

35
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:42,156
Take radiation gamma-ray reading.
Get your monkey ready.

36
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:45,368
Sir, this is a waste of time.

37
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:47,328
We have standard procedures...

38
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:51,624
- I'm aware of the procedures, but...
- No manned flights.

39
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:55,670
We send an ape. If it's safe,
we talk about a pilot.

40
00:07:55,878 --> 00:07:58,881
Why don't you just allow me
to do my job?

41
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,594
He's the canary, that's the coal mine.
He launches at 16:00.

42
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:25,616
Just follow your sequence
and come home. Understand? Home.

43
00:08:36,877 --> 00:08:40,756
<i>Stand by. Alpha pod launch
in 30 seconds.</i>

44
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:00,609
<i>Chart his course
to the eye of the storm.</i>

45
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:06,198
<i>Okay, Pericles, start sequence one.</i>

46
00:09:13,664 --> 00:09:15,708
Activate reading systems.

47
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:22,882
<i>Ignition.</i>

48
00:09:31,557 --> 00:09:34,769
<i>Have him start
taking perimeter readings.</i>

49
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:42,818
- What's wrong?
- He's off-course.

50
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:44,153
Lock on him.

51
00:09:46,906 --> 00:09:48,532
He can't respond, sir.

52
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:53,370
- There's a surge in the heart rate.
- Light him up again.

53
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:55,414
I can't.

54
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,043
He's gone.

55
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:01,462
He's trained to come back.

56
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:04,381
You think he's still alive?

57
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:12,264
- Sir...
- For now, we just sit tight and wait.

58
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:17,937
I'm gonna run some sequences
to see what he did wrong.

59
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:29,365
<i>The signal is breaking up.
He must be panicking.</i>

60
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:31,575
<i>He'll return to the Oberon.</i>

61
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:33,244
<i>I can 't hold him.</i>

62
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:35,162
<i>That's it, we lost him.</i>

63
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:39,166
Wanna send up another chimp?
- It's too dangerous.

64
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,502
<i>I won 't waste another pod.</i>

65
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:44,255
<i>Shut down launch operations.</i>

66
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:17,496
Sir?

67
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:19,581
Delta pod has launched.

68
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:24,837
Your flight is not authorized!

69
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm going to get my chimp.

70
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:30,592
<i>Bring that thing back here!
Return to base!</i>

71
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:33,846
Never send a monkey to do a man's job.

72
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,618
I got a visual on Alpha pod.

73
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:14,470
<i>Oberon, come back!</i>

74
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,069
<i>Oberon, come in!</i>

75
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:43,874
- I'm getting a mayday, sir.
- Alpha pod?

76
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:47,544
- I don't know, but it's strong.
Put it up.

77
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,881
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Come in!</i>

78
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:54,718
<i>Request... We're going down! Mayday!</i>

79
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,222
Delta pod, abort.

80
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,168
This one looked at me.

81
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,721
Take your stinking hands off me,
you damn dirty human!

82
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:54,953
Stinking humans!

83
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,455
You guys smell!

84
00:19:51,175 --> 00:19:53,177
Hey, where am I?

85
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:57,098
What is this place?

86
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:11,446
Here! I'm open! Come on!

87
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:14,532
Dribble it down! Take it!

88
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:20,538
Make way! Clear the path!

89
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:22,415
Get the humans!

90
00:20:26,044 --> 00:20:28,379
You guys smell!

91
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:31,382
Take this!

92
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:37,388
Stupid human!
Stop it!

93
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:44,562
- Who said to throw stones at humans?
- My father.

94
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:46,522
Well, he's wrong.

95
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:49,942
- And you can tell him I said so.
- Human-lover.

96
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:12,965
Move along!

97
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:21,307
Are you trying
to put me out of business?

98
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:25,061
These are the skankiest, scabbiest...

99
00:21:25,311 --> 00:21:27,980
...skuzziest humans I've ever seen.

100
00:21:28,314 --> 00:21:32,318
- You don't want them?
- I'll take the whole lot.

101
00:21:33,986 --> 00:21:36,656
I must be out of my mind.

102
00:21:36,989 --> 00:21:39,367
I'll have to make it up on volume.

103
00:21:39,617 --> 00:21:42,412
All right, get them out...

104
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,331
...and get them clean! Chop, chop!

105
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:52,630
Let's go!

106
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,549
Keep it moving!

107
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,384
Come on! Hurry up!

108
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:04,600
Gentlemen to the left!
Ladies to the right, please!

109
00:22:05,017 --> 00:22:06,269
Don't be afraid.

110
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:08,146
Come on.

111
00:22:09,021 --> 00:22:12,942
Very touching. I can't see
for the tears in my eyes.

112
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:16,362
Come on. That one's
crawling with lice.

113
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:22,243
Check the teeth
on that little one. Nice.

114
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,505
Stay back. Back!

115
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:38,342
Get in there!

116
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:43,890
Move! You too!

117
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:50,354
How many times have I told you to
wear gloves when you handle humans?

118
00:22:55,234 --> 00:22:58,321
You normally hack off a limb, Limbo.

119
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:01,449
Yes, general. That's true.

120
00:23:01,657 --> 00:23:04,952
Unfortunately,
they're worth more intact.

121
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:09,832
Keep your eye on this one.

122
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:13,294
He's feisty.

123
00:23:18,591 --> 00:23:22,136
Were these the ones
raiding the orchards?

124
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:26,599
I know an old country remedy
that never fails.

125
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:30,770
You gut one human,
and you string the carcass up.

126
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:34,774
The Human Rights faction
is on me already.

127
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:38,945
Do-gooders. Who needs them?
I'm for free speech as long as they...

128
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:42,531
...keep their mouths shut.

129
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:43,949
My niece wants one
for her birthday.

130
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:50,831
Excellent. The little ones
make wonderful pets.

131
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,377
But be sure
you get rid of it by puberty.

132
00:23:54,585 --> 00:23:59,340
One thing you don't want in your
house, it's a human teenager.

133
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:05,304
Any one you'd like, sweetheart.

134
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:08,974
That one.

135
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,520
Oh, isn't she pretty.

136
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:19,694
I'll get that for you, sir.

137
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:41,340
And I have a pretty new collar...

138
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:43,759
...just for you.

139
00:24:45,177 --> 00:24:47,054
Compliments of the house.

140
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:53,853
You stink of humans.

141
00:25:05,698 --> 00:25:08,909
It's disgusting
the way we treat humans.

142
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,745
It demeans us as much as them.

143
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,545
Ari, let's go.

144
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:30,306
Get them marked!
I got orders to fill!

145
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:52,828
Next!

146
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:08,802
Not you again.

147
00:26:09,011 --> 00:26:13,807
I can't stand by while humans
are being mistreated and tortured.

148
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:20,230
The only reason I put up with your
nonsense is because of your father!

149
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:23,525
You want me to stop?
Give up the business.

150
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:27,112
Hey, I do the job
that nobody else wants!

151
00:26:27,446 --> 00:26:30,991
I don't see you bleeding-hearts
spending all day...

152
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,870
...with these dangerous,
dirty, dumb beasts.

153
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:38,707
They can be taught
to live with us as equals.

154
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:41,543
I'm gonna prove it.

155
00:26:42,127 --> 00:26:44,213
Don't do that.

156
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,757
Don't do that.

157
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:49,718
Stay back.

158
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:53,222
Well, now there's your proof.

159
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:56,475
Now I'm gonna have to put him down.

160
00:26:56,809 --> 00:26:58,143
Help me.

161
00:26:58,644 --> 00:26:59,895
Please.

162
00:27:01,146 --> 00:27:02,648
Please help me.

163
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:08,654
You're giving me such a headache.

164
00:27:13,158 --> 00:27:15,327
I don't need this aggravation!

165
00:27:16,662 --> 00:27:17,830
Sell him to me.

166
00:27:18,163 --> 00:27:21,667
Are you crazy? He's wild.
They're both wild.

167
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,419
Then I'll buy them both.

168
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:27,005
That would be expensive.

169
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,676
That would be...

170
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:33,011
...very, very expensive.

171
00:27:39,852 --> 00:27:41,270
I'm sure we can...

172
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:44,022
...you know, come to a deal.

173
00:27:46,024 --> 00:27:47,192
You know?

174
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:55,200
Deliver them to my house.

175
00:27:58,871 --> 00:28:01,206
<i>Semos, help me!</i>

176
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:05,711
Rise when your master enters.

177
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:12,301
Wild humans...

178
00:28:13,385 --> 00:28:15,554
...in my house.

179
00:28:16,138 --> 00:28:18,056
This one seems different.

180
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:22,853
How could he be different?
You can't tell one from the other!

181
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:24,730
My guests are here.

182
00:28:25,063 --> 00:28:28,817
Keep the savage ones out of sight.

183
00:28:33,614 --> 00:28:35,991
Especially from General Thade!

184
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,203
You'd better be nice to him!

185
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:45,792
And wash your hands before dinner.

186
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:56,845
Senator, good evening.
Dear, you look lovely tonight.

187
00:28:57,095 --> 00:28:59,598
But I'm having a bad hair day.

188
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:02,684
Yet, she spends a fortune grooming.

189
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:05,020
And I'm worth every penny.

190
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:09,107
Would you like to freshen up?

191
00:29:10,525 --> 00:29:11,735
We're fine.

192
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,048
- How'd these monkeys get like this?
- How else would they be?

193
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:38,303
- They'd be begging me for a treat.
- What tribe are you from?

194
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:41,890
U.S. Air Force. I'm going back to it.

195
00:29:57,572 --> 00:29:59,741
Finish your work.

196
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:06,915
Please, everyone sit.

197
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:12,254
We just returned
from our country house.

198
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:14,589
- How was it?
- Boring.

199
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:19,594
I find it relaxing being away
from the bustle of the city.

200
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:22,097
There was no place to go.

201
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:25,559
Nothing but trees and rocks.

202
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:28,937
- All you did was nap.
- Exactly.

203
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:31,690
Time away from politics...

204
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:33,775
...is what I needed.

205
00:30:35,152 --> 00:30:39,823
We'd lose ourselves for days
in the forest when we were young.

206
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:42,242
Now I can barely climb a tree.

207
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:46,663
Trite but true:
"Youth is wasted on the young."

208
00:30:47,998 --> 00:30:52,085
Oh, how did I get so old so fast?

209
00:30:52,294 --> 00:30:56,757
Living with your daughter
would age any ape quickly.

210
00:30:56,965 --> 00:30:59,509
You've been a stranger lately.

211
00:30:59,718 --> 00:31:02,929
I apologize for my lateness, senator.

212
00:31:05,724 --> 00:31:07,851
I stopped to see my father.

213
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:11,229
- How's my old friend?
- Slipping, I'm afraid.

214
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:15,817
I'd like to see him more,
but these are troubled days.

215
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:18,320
The humans infest the provinces.

216
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,864
We encroach upon their habitat.

217
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:24,451
They breed while we grow soft
in our affluence.

218
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,120
They outnumber us four to one!

219
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:29,915
Why can't we simply
sterilize them all?

220
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:32,918
The cost would be prohibitive.

221
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:35,462
Although scientists tell me...

222
00:31:35,712 --> 00:31:39,049
...these humans
carry terrible diseases.

223
00:31:39,257 --> 00:31:40,675
How would we know?

224
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:44,596
The army burns the bodies
before they're examined.

225
00:31:48,517 --> 00:31:49,768
Father?

226
00:31:54,773 --> 00:31:59,402
At times, perhaps, the senate feels
that the army has been...

227
00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:01,279
...a tad extreme.

228
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:06,910
Extremism in defense of apes
is no vice, senator!

229
00:32:07,244 --> 00:32:09,955
Your ideas threaten our prosperity!

230
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:13,625
The human problem
can't be solved with money!

231
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:17,003
We tried that once,
and all we got was...

232
00:32:17,212 --> 00:32:20,090
...a welfare state that nearly broke us.

233
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,678
I think the city has about
as much diversity as I can handle.

234
00:32:25,303 --> 00:32:30,100
This garment was made
by one of my humans.

235
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:33,895
And can you deny the skill?

236
00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:37,607
Obviously, they're capable
of a real culture.

237
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,196
Everything in the human culture
takes place below the waist.

238
00:32:50,328 --> 00:32:51,705
Bow your heads!

239
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:58,920
We give thanks
for the fruit of the land.

240
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:03,967
Bless us, holy father, who created
all apes in his image.

241
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:09,597
Hasten the day when you will return
and bring peace to your children.

242
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:12,517
<i>- Amen.
Amen.</i>

243
00:33:20,025 --> 00:33:23,695
Next you'll be telling us
these beasts have a soul.

244
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:25,530
Of course they do.

245
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:29,659
The senator's daughter
flirts with blasphemy.

246
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:43,882
Is there a soul in there?

247
00:33:56,978 --> 00:33:58,646
Do you have a towel?

248
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,697
I've lost my appetite.

249
00:34:43,107 --> 00:34:45,610
I'm bored by these society dinners.

250
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:49,697
- I came to see you.
- Oh, how sweet.

251
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:51,866
You've wasted your time.

252
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,536
My feelings haven't changed.

253
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:57,330
I still care about you.

254
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:05,255
You only care about my father's
influence. And your own ambition.

255
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:11,928
I know about the trouble
you caused today.

256
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:16,558
- I could have you arrested.
- I'd do it again.

257
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:20,645
You feel so much for these humans...

258
00:35:21,312 --> 00:35:23,606
...yet you feel nothing for me.

259
00:35:36,661 --> 00:35:38,037
A moment, sir.

260
00:35:39,998 --> 00:35:41,374
What is it?

261
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:45,378
We found something.
We think you should see it.

262
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:18,661
There's a curfew.

263
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,247
If they see you, they kill you.

264
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:24,459
You stay here, you're already dead.

265
00:36:27,378 --> 00:36:30,089
Can you take me to
where we were caught?

266
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:32,550
Not without my family.

267
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:53,404
This is where I saw it.

268
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:57,492
Go on.

269
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:02,538
Something fell from the sky
with wings of fire.

270
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:07,043
There was a thunderous sound
and the ground itself shook.

271
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:11,214
- You weren't dreaming this?
- It was no dream, sir.

272
00:37:11,422 --> 00:37:12,840
Look.

273
00:37:20,223 --> 00:37:22,892
- You told no one?
No, sir.

274
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:25,770
We had to come right to you.

275
00:37:27,522 --> 00:37:29,941
You did exactly the right thing.

276
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:19,740
You smell that?

277
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:22,535
Don't start now. We're off-duty.

278
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:24,495
And I'm starving.

279
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:37,300
You're hurt.

280
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:39,802
How did you get away?

281
00:38:58,029 --> 00:39:00,781
- Who are you?
- Somebody trying to get out.

282
00:39:05,453 --> 00:39:07,788
She promised to take me back.

283
00:39:09,123 --> 00:39:13,252
This is a house-human.
He thinks he's better than us.

284
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:14,420
Hey!

285
00:39:17,048 --> 00:39:18,674
We'll go together.

286
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:52,226
Good night, little girl.

287
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:17,918
You go this way.

288
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:20,170
The rest of you, come with me.

289
00:41:35,352 --> 00:41:37,813
Send a squad to the north gate! Hurry!

290
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,650
Wait! Someone's coming.

291
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:59,126
You're lucky I found you first.

292
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:02,212
Come on. I can reason with them.

293
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:05,591
- We know how apes reason.
- How can we escape?

294
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:08,427
Don't get involved with these humans.

295
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:11,263
Why did you help me?

296
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:14,391
Why would you take that chance?

297
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:16,810
Because...

298
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:20,773
...you're not usual.

299
00:42:21,357 --> 00:42:26,695
Show me a way out. I'll show you
something that will change your world.

300
00:42:31,075 --> 00:42:32,534
Trust me.

301
00:42:42,544 --> 00:42:43,879
When I was little...

302
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:48,884
...I used to sneak outside the city,
where no one could find me.

303
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,513
I can show you.

304
00:42:53,555 --> 00:42:56,308
If we're caught, no one can protect us!

305
00:42:57,017 --> 00:42:58,394
Trust me.

306
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:05,275
What about her?

307
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:11,115
- A human child won't survive.
- Bon can take her. Hide her at home.

308
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:28,632
Check every house!

309
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:34,429
Have you seen any humans?
- No.

310
00:43:43,939 --> 00:43:45,315
Hurry!

311
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:50,654
- Father.
- I'll be right beside you.

312
00:43:50,863 --> 00:43:51,905
Come on!

313
00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:10,007
No!

314
00:44:13,135 --> 00:44:14,386
Stop!

315
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:44,499
- Where are the other humans?
- Through the tunnels.

316
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:47,252
When you find them, kill them all.

317
00:44:48,295 --> 00:44:52,841
Except for the troublemaker.
I want to talk to him before he dies.

318
00:44:53,508 --> 00:44:56,428
Sir, the senator's daughter is with them.

319
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:03,518
- They took her?
- She's helping them. I saw her myself.

320
00:45:07,564 --> 00:45:11,026
She had no choice.
They threatened her life.

321
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:18,325
I'll report to the Senate. They'll beat
their chests and ask for my help.

322
00:45:18,617 --> 00:45:21,036
They are weak without you, sir.

323
00:45:41,723 --> 00:45:44,643
- Your dad was brave.
- What do you know?

324
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,232
Let me go.

325
00:45:56,947 --> 00:46:00,450
Thade will come soon.
We can still go back.

326
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:04,413
I can't now.

327
00:46:25,892 --> 00:46:27,769
That's where I flew in.

328
00:46:29,896 --> 00:46:30,981
You did that?

329
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:32,816
No, my retroburners.

330
00:46:33,608 --> 00:46:37,779
- I'm sure he'll explain.
- He can't explain what can't exist.

331
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:40,073
Talking monkeys can't exist.

332
00:46:46,538 --> 00:46:48,248
Apes.

333
00:46:48,456 --> 00:46:52,335
Monkeys are further down
the evolutionary ladder.

334
00:46:52,544 --> 00:46:55,505
Just above humans.

335
00:47:00,385 --> 00:47:01,970
Calm down, will you?

336
00:47:07,434 --> 00:47:10,896
- What's wrong?
- Afraid of water. Apes can't swim.

337
00:47:11,104 --> 00:47:12,189
We drown.

338
00:47:12,439 --> 00:47:15,317
That's why every day we pray for rain.

339
00:47:41,718 --> 00:47:45,013
How long can a human
hold its breath underwater?

340
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:42,070
Thought you were afraid of water.
Two dead monkey...

341
00:48:42,278 --> 00:48:44,114
Apes down at the bottom.

342
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:47,867
Someone else knows you're here.

343
00:49:09,472 --> 00:49:11,433
- What's that?
- A frequency with...

344
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:13,810
...my ship so I can talk to them.

345
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:15,019
It talks?

346
00:49:16,396 --> 00:49:17,647
With radio waves.

347
00:49:17,897 --> 00:49:19,399
Sorcery.

348
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:21,443
Not sorcery, science.

349
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:32,328
I have contact.

350
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:36,291
They're already here.
They must be waiting for me.

351
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:39,169
It'll lead us to them.

352
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,549
We're in control now.
We're the 800-pound gorilla.

353
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:49,179
Who are you?

354
00:49:49,387 --> 00:49:52,140
Captain Leo Davidson.
Pilot, U.S. Air Force.

355
00:49:52,348 --> 00:49:55,476
- From planet Earth.
- Your apes let you fly?

356
00:49:55,685 --> 00:49:58,521
They live in zoos and do what we say.

357
00:50:00,648 --> 00:50:02,942
This is hostile.
I got 36 hours...

358
00:50:03,151 --> 00:50:06,696
...to find my friends
and I'm out of this nightmare.

359
00:50:06,988 --> 00:50:09,741
What happens to us?
Where do we go?

360
00:50:11,951 --> 00:50:14,579
You go nowhere. He belongs to me!

361
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:17,415
Stop!

362
00:50:17,624 --> 00:50:19,500
You, I've had enough of!

363
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:35,600
Take it easy, little fella.

364
00:50:35,808 --> 00:50:37,894
I'm not gonna hurt you.

365
00:50:38,394 --> 00:50:40,605
I wouldn't hurt my property.

366
00:50:43,566 --> 00:50:45,568
But I'll make an exception.

367
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,663
No harm done. Come here, kid.

368
00:50:57,205 --> 00:50:58,998
Come here.

369
00:50:59,707 --> 00:51:03,795
You're not hurt, right? You're young.

370
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:07,131
Oh, these kids.
They bounce right back.

371
00:51:08,216 --> 00:51:09,634
Play dead.

372
00:51:11,094 --> 00:51:13,221
- Kill him.
- Slave trader.

373
00:51:15,932 --> 00:51:19,352
You kill him, you lower
yourself to his level.

374
00:51:19,811 --> 00:51:21,062
Exactly.

375
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:24,440
She is extremely smart.

376
00:51:24,691 --> 00:51:27,819
I've heard her talk
about apes and humans.

377
00:51:28,027 --> 00:51:32,115
"Separate but equal."
"To each his own."

378
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:34,659
Something like that. Right?

379
00:51:34,909 --> 00:51:37,870
Whatever it is, I agree.

380
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,790
Can't we all just get along?

381
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:50,717
I'm probably just in the way.
So why don't I just get going?

382
00:51:52,927 --> 00:51:54,929
He'll lead them to us.

383
00:51:55,138 --> 00:51:57,181
Then we'll make him our guest.

384
00:51:58,057 --> 00:51:59,517
Cuff him.

385
00:52:05,606 --> 00:52:07,817
Ow! These things hurt.

386
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:16,784
- What are you doing?
- You could use that against us.

387
00:52:17,034 --> 00:52:20,037
- Who invented that?
- It was gonna save us.

388
00:52:20,246 --> 00:52:21,998
- We're better off now.
- We?

389
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:25,877
- You're so difficult.
- Like a slave?

390
00:52:26,085 --> 00:52:28,463
- That's not what...
- Shut up!

391
00:52:29,505 --> 00:52:31,591
That goes for all species.

392
00:52:41,684 --> 00:52:46,814
If ever I thought those humans were
capable of kidnapping my daughter...

393
00:52:47,023 --> 00:52:49,484
Don't blame yourself, senator.

394
00:52:49,692 --> 00:52:52,695
You've been compassionate with them.

395
00:52:52,945 --> 00:52:54,989
Look how they've repaid you.

396
00:52:55,198 --> 00:52:57,074
Can you find her?

397
00:52:59,952 --> 00:53:01,704
If you untie my hands.

398
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,957
What do you want?

399
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:07,126
Declare martial law.

400
00:53:08,503 --> 00:53:10,630
Give me absolute power...

401
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,342
...to rid this planet of humans
once and for all.

402
00:53:16,177 --> 00:53:20,389
Now is not the time to be timid
or indecisive.

403
00:53:21,182 --> 00:53:24,977
I'm the one who can bring
your daughter back alive.

404
00:53:44,205 --> 00:53:46,249
He's not in the city.

405
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:49,001
We underestimate this human.

406
00:53:50,711 --> 00:53:52,296
I'll hunt him down.

407
00:54:01,555 --> 00:54:05,017
Your father sent me.
You must come quickly.

408
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:10,022
Warn the outposts.
Don't let the humans pass.

409
00:54:10,272 --> 00:54:11,607
I understand, sir.

410
00:54:12,608 --> 00:54:15,569
Apart from my father,
I rely on you most.

411
00:54:15,778 --> 00:54:19,323
We are not just soldiers.
We are friends.

412
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:21,659
I'll depend on you.

413
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:23,411
Yes, sir.

414
00:54:39,301 --> 00:54:42,179
- So many questions I want to ask.
- Me too.

415
00:54:42,388 --> 00:54:44,056
These "zoos"...

416
00:54:44,265 --> 00:54:47,518
What are they? This word is
not familiar.

417
00:54:47,727 --> 00:54:51,564
- Our last apes are in zoos.
- What happened to them?

418
00:54:51,772 --> 00:54:53,232
Gone.

419
00:54:53,441 --> 00:54:55,901
After we cut down the forests...

420
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:58,821
...the ones who survived...

421
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,741
...were locked up in cages.

422
00:55:01,991 --> 00:55:04,452
Used for scientific experiment.

423
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:08,456
- That's horrible.
- We do worse to our own kind.

424
00:55:08,664 --> 00:55:11,625
I don't understand.
You seem intelligent.

425
00:55:11,834 --> 00:55:15,755
Smarter we get, the more
dangerous our world becomes.

426
00:55:17,423 --> 00:55:19,717
I knew it. You're sensitive.

427
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:23,012
Uncommon quality in a male.

428
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:28,851
Why don't your apes object
to the way you treat them?

429
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,895
They can't talk.

430
00:55:31,103 --> 00:55:34,899
Maybe they choose not to,
given the way you treat them.

431
00:55:36,984 --> 00:55:38,694
Apes in cages. Right.

432
00:56:02,676 --> 00:56:04,386
Father.

433
00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:10,893
I don't have much time.

434
00:56:11,143 --> 00:56:14,188
Tell me about this human...

435
00:56:14,563 --> 00:56:16,440
...who troubles you.

436
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:20,528
I will capture him
with little trouble.

437
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:24,782
No. You're not telling me everything.

438
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:29,787
You believe he is not born
of this world.

439
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:35,167
Has he come alone?

440
00:56:35,668 --> 00:56:36,877
Yes.

441
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:40,923
More will come looking for him.

442
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,259
How can you possibly know?

443
00:56:47,012 --> 00:56:50,224
I have something to tell you.

444
00:56:50,975 --> 00:56:53,686
Something my father told me...

445
00:56:53,894 --> 00:56:57,564
...and his father told him.

446
00:56:57,815 --> 00:57:02,194
Back along our bloodlines to Semos.

447
00:57:03,862 --> 00:57:05,948
In the time before time...

448
00:57:06,198 --> 00:57:09,743
...we were the slaves
and the humans...

449
00:57:10,577 --> 00:57:12,079
...were the masters.

450
00:57:13,706 --> 00:57:15,082
Impossible.

451
00:57:39,231 --> 00:57:40,274
Break it.

452
00:57:59,585 --> 00:58:03,797
What you hold in your hand
is the proof of their power.

453
00:58:04,298 --> 00:58:06,216
Their power of invention.

454
00:58:06,467 --> 00:58:08,927
Their power of technology.

455
00:58:09,136 --> 00:58:14,308
Against this, our strength
means nothing.

456
00:58:17,686 --> 00:58:22,858
This has the power
of a thousand spears.

457
00:58:23,525 --> 00:58:24,943
I warn you.

458
00:58:25,152 --> 00:58:29,823
Their ingenuity goes hand in hand
with their cruelty.

459
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:32,826
No creature...

460
00:58:33,035 --> 00:58:36,830
...is as devious, as violent.

461
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:40,209
You must find this human quickly.

462
00:58:40,459 --> 00:58:44,755
Do not let him get to Calima.

463
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,965
The forbidden area?

464
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:53,680
Calima holds the secret
to our true beginnings.

465
00:58:57,059 --> 00:58:58,727
Damn them.

466
00:58:59,228 --> 00:59:01,814
I will stop him, Father.

467
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:04,733
Damn them.

468
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:08,111
Damn them all to hell.

469
00:59:49,486 --> 00:59:50,862
What is it?

470
00:59:51,363 --> 00:59:53,991
They're to keep us away.

471
00:59:54,449 --> 00:59:56,910
What's on the other side?

472
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,080
It leads to the sacred
ruins at Calima.

473
01:00:00,497 --> 01:00:04,668
- What is that?
- Calima? That's where, well...

474
01:00:04,918 --> 01:00:08,839
...according to our holy writings,
creation began.

475
01:00:09,715 --> 01:00:14,261
Where the Almighty
breathed life into Semos...

476
01:00:14,469 --> 01:00:16,513
...the first ape.

477
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:20,017
In the time before time.

478
01:00:22,936 --> 01:00:25,731
It is where Semos will return.

479
01:00:25,939 --> 01:00:31,111
Most educated apes consider
such religious notions as fairy tales.

480
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:35,532
Metaphors we use to explain our origins.

481
01:00:35,741 --> 01:00:38,952
I doubt if there ever really was a Semos.

482
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,335
My crew is there, so we're going.

483
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:48,420
Doesn't he ever stop?

484
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:13,695
- They're scared of water?
- We'll cross somewhere else.

485
01:01:15,947 --> 01:01:19,326
No time. Gets dark,
we're going right through.

486
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,710
Semos smiles on me.

487
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:30,337
I win again.

488
01:01:32,506 --> 01:01:36,176
You win too often.
What's hidden up your sleeve?

489
01:01:38,136 --> 01:01:39,262
All of them.

490
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:42,432
Cheater!

491
01:01:55,237 --> 01:01:58,281
- Who's in charge here?!
- I am, sir!

492
01:01:59,407 --> 01:02:02,828
- I didn't know...
- This camp is a disgrace.

493
01:02:03,578 --> 01:02:07,958
Some humans have escaped!
- If they come, we will crush them.

494
01:02:08,166 --> 01:02:11,628
These humans are different.
They travel with apes.

495
01:02:16,216 --> 01:02:18,051
You find this amusing?

496
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:19,928
No, sir.

497
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:24,683
I'm assuming command.
This camp will be prepared!

498
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,082
Just grab the reins.

499
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:52,210
Hold tight. We're gonna
cross the river.

500
01:02:56,673 --> 01:03:00,635
Horses are great swimmers.
They'll carry you across.

501
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:11,730
Good luck. Have a nice ride.
Leave me. I'll only slow you down.

502
01:03:11,938 --> 01:03:14,774
- Letting him go?
- No. He'll ride with us.

503
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:18,778
No, wait. Wait. This is suicide.

504
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:22,657
Only a human would think
that this could work.

505
01:03:41,718 --> 01:03:46,097
Hear my prayers, Semos,
father of all apes.

506
01:04:16,002 --> 01:04:18,129
No! No! I'm on your side!

507
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:26,763
Come on!

508
01:05:39,544 --> 01:05:41,588
Come on! We have to swim.

509
01:05:42,422 --> 01:05:43,548
Hey!

510
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,301
I won't let go of you!

511
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:48,011
Come on!

512
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:32,847
No, no, wait. There's no need now.

513
01:06:33,139 --> 01:06:34,724
- Says who?
- Them.

514
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:39,520
They tried to kill me like
I was nothing but a miserable...

515
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:42,774
Human?

516
01:07:17,892 --> 01:07:18,976
Ow.

517
01:07:19,227 --> 01:07:20,603
You're hurt.

518
01:07:21,187 --> 01:07:23,523
She was holding on pretty tight.

519
01:07:25,191 --> 01:07:29,779
The soldiers will cross downstream.
We should move quickly!

520
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,456
They crossed the river.
- You didn't stop them?

521
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:44,585
Horses carried them.

522
01:07:49,048 --> 01:07:50,424
Horses?

523
01:07:51,259 --> 01:07:53,511
Our horses, sir.

524
01:08:30,548 --> 01:08:34,427
Forgive me, my friend.
I'm not angry with you.

525
01:08:34,635 --> 01:08:36,345
Father was taken from me.

526
01:08:36,929 --> 01:08:41,350
He was a great leader
and a direct descendant of Semos.

527
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:45,062
Now it's time for you to lead.

528
01:08:46,981 --> 01:08:48,816
Form the divisions.

529
01:08:49,108 --> 01:08:50,234
Form divisions!

530
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,115
Full battle ready!

531
01:08:59,452 --> 01:09:01,370
Sound the call to march!

532
01:09:32,443 --> 01:09:35,321
Tomorrow we reach Calima.

533
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:52,046
He'll stay like that all night.

534
01:09:53,881 --> 01:09:55,508
A soldier, isn't he?

535
01:09:55,716 --> 01:09:59,762
A general. Well, he was
until he opposed Thade.

536
01:10:00,012 --> 01:10:04,016
When Thade ruined his career,
my father took him in.

537
01:10:05,976 --> 01:10:09,563
He was a great soldier.
Attar was his best pupil.

538
01:10:10,231 --> 01:10:12,441
Now they're enemies.

539
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:19,657
I'd like to see your world.

540
01:10:20,157 --> 01:10:24,954
They'd probably prod you and poke you
and throw you in a cage.

541
01:10:27,706 --> 01:10:29,417
You'd protect me.

542
01:10:43,597 --> 01:10:46,016
They think you'll save them.

543
01:10:48,352 --> 01:10:52,440
After you meet your friends,
we'll never see you again.

544
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:57,653
Well, I didn't promise them anything.

545
01:10:58,529 --> 01:10:59,780
No.

546
01:11:00,906 --> 01:11:03,659
You just dropped in from the stars.

547
01:12:17,858 --> 01:12:19,652
They're not here.

548
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,249
Hello?

549
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,516
They were never here.

550
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:55,104
You said they'd come for us.

551
01:13:22,923 --> 01:13:24,717
That's impossible.

552
01:13:45,946 --> 01:13:46,822
What is it?

553
01:13:48,449 --> 01:13:50,159
It's my ship.

554
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:55,164
These ruins are
thousands of years old.

555
01:13:56,081 --> 01:13:58,500
I was just here a few days ago.

556
01:14:16,101 --> 01:14:19,146
<i>This is what I was
picking up. The Oberon.</i>

557
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:29,990
What are you doing?

558
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:33,744
It has a power source
that lasts forever.

559
01:14:45,505 --> 01:14:48,592
Maybe I can access
the ship's visual log.

560
01:14:49,468 --> 01:14:52,471
Then I can figure out what happened.

561
01:15:00,938 --> 01:15:03,190
<i>Mayday! Come in, guidance!</i>

562
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,943
<i>Request instructions!
Going down!</i>

563
01:15:09,613 --> 01:15:13,867
<i>We were searching for a pilot
in an electromagnetic storm.</i>

564
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:18,038
I got pushed forward through time.

565
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:22,668
<i>We haven 't had any communications
since we crashed.</i>

566
01:15:23,543 --> 01:15:26,546
<i>This planet is uncharted, uninhabited.</i>

567
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:32,177
<i>The apes we've brought along with us
are a lot stronger...</i>

568
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:33,887
<i>... and a lot smarter...</i>

569
01:15:34,304 --> 01:15:36,264
<i>... than we ever imagined.</i>

570
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,273
<i>Apes are out of control.</i>

571
01:15:45,857 --> 01:15:47,401
<i>One male named Semos...</i>

572
01:15:48,485 --> 01:15:52,781
<i>... who I raised myself,
has taken over the group.</i>

573
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:56,576
<i>We have weapons but I don 't
think we'll last long.</i>

574
01:15:56,785 --> 01:16:00,247
<i>Maybe I saw the truth,
but I wouldn't admit it.</i>

575
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:02,374
<i>They were good students...</i>

576
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:16,346
They're all dead
because they looked for me.

577
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:23,437
We're alive because of you.

578
01:16:47,294 --> 01:16:48,336
Who are they?

579
01:16:48,712 --> 01:16:51,590
Your story is spreading.
They want to see...

580
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,509
...this human who defies the apes.

581
01:16:55,469 --> 01:16:57,053
Send them all back.

582
01:16:57,262 --> 01:17:00,557
Where? They left their homes
to be with you.

583
01:18:14,005 --> 01:18:15,382
I saw them.

584
01:18:15,715 --> 01:18:16,967
How many?

585
01:18:17,175 --> 01:18:19,177
As far as I could see.

586
01:18:20,178 --> 01:18:24,182
Thade has all his legions.
The senate's capitulated.

587
01:18:25,016 --> 01:18:27,310
He answers to no one now.

588
01:18:32,732 --> 01:18:36,736
You're gonna have to get your people
out of here.

589
01:18:37,487 --> 01:18:39,197
They won't listen to me.

590
01:18:53,336 --> 01:18:55,463
This is a fight we can't win.

591
01:18:56,589 --> 01:18:58,800
Break up and scatter.

592
01:18:59,467 --> 01:19:02,345
I'll draw them off.
I'm who they want.

593
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:05,849
All right? Come on!

594
01:19:06,391 --> 01:19:07,767
Let's go!

595
01:19:08,184 --> 01:19:09,644
Let's go!

596
01:19:12,856 --> 01:19:13,940
Come on!

597
01:19:24,492 --> 01:19:27,036
You've gotta make them understand.

598
01:19:27,287 --> 01:19:29,664
It's over. No help is coming.

599
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:39,048
You came.

600
01:20:07,285 --> 01:20:10,622
Stop!
Come closer and identify yourself!

601
01:20:15,835 --> 01:20:18,463
How dare you show your face here?!

602
01:20:19,506 --> 01:20:22,425
It is not my decision.

603
01:20:30,642 --> 01:20:32,852
I wish to speak to Thade.

604
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:13,393
Why have you come?

605
01:21:24,445 --> 01:21:26,239
To be with you.

606
01:21:39,043 --> 01:21:40,169
A trade?

607
01:21:40,503 --> 01:21:44,215
You're proposing that?
Yourself for the humans?

608
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,514
Even when you were a child,
you took in stray humans.

609
01:21:51,723 --> 01:21:54,267
Your family indulged you.

610
01:21:58,771 --> 01:22:00,481
Look what you've become.

611
01:22:02,066 --> 01:22:03,568
I've been...

612
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:05,987
...mistaken.

613
01:22:09,073 --> 01:22:10,575
Forgive me.

614
01:22:28,384 --> 01:22:31,304
So you want to be human?

615
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:40,688
Then wear their mark!

616
01:22:48,821 --> 01:22:49,947
Let her return.

617
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:54,035
She'll die with her friends tomorrow.

618
01:23:34,742 --> 01:23:39,914
<i>We were searching for a pilot
in an electromagnetic storm.</i>

619
01:23:40,331 --> 01:23:43,876
<i>We haven 't had any communications
since we crashed.</i>

620
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:45,753
I'm so sorry.

621
01:23:48,339 --> 01:23:50,967
I'm responsible for all of this.

622
01:23:51,467 --> 01:23:53,678
And I'm never going home.

623
01:23:56,013 --> 01:23:57,765
Just like them.

624
01:24:00,851 --> 01:24:03,020
<i>The apes are out of control.</i>

625
01:24:15,241 --> 01:24:17,451
I can't go home, either.

626
01:24:19,203 --> 01:24:21,163
Maybe we're not so different.

627
01:24:23,499 --> 01:24:27,128
No. We're very different.

628
01:24:29,839 --> 01:24:32,883
You care about everybody but yourself.

629
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:38,431
Doesn't matter. Apes, humans.
My planet, your planet.

630
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:41,892
The universe rewards cruelty with power.

631
01:24:43,185 --> 01:24:44,353
No.

632
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:49,442
Not always. Not if we fight back.

633
01:24:55,031 --> 01:24:57,074
I'm just not sure how.

634
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:06,876
Better take care of that.

635
01:25:16,969 --> 01:25:20,014
I respect your courage.

636
01:25:20,931 --> 01:25:24,810
But my advice to you is
to put that away...

637
01:25:25,519 --> 01:25:27,772
...and head for the mountains.

638
01:26:13,025 --> 01:26:14,777
There's one possibility.

639
01:26:15,778 --> 01:26:18,739
I want those people behind the ship.

640
01:26:18,948 --> 01:26:22,368
- Not hiding, they need to be seen.
- And us?

641
01:26:22,785 --> 01:26:25,663
You'll be in front. You're the bait.

642
01:26:25,871 --> 01:26:28,666
- I won't move.
- You won't be there.

643
01:26:28,916 --> 01:26:33,420
- I can do this!
- I know. I need you back with them.

644
01:26:35,214 --> 01:26:36,632
We got one shot.

645
01:26:42,137 --> 01:26:43,472
Listen!

646
01:26:43,889 --> 01:26:45,349
I got an idea.

647
01:26:45,599 --> 01:26:49,436
We may have a chance.
I need you behind the ship.

648
01:26:52,314 --> 01:26:54,525
Hey, we can win this.

649
01:26:54,733 --> 01:26:58,028
It's been done before. On my planet.

650
01:26:58,821 --> 01:27:02,157
Men have done amazing things in history.

651
01:27:02,366 --> 01:27:04,326
That history belongs to you.

652
01:27:06,036 --> 01:27:09,707
Sometimes even a few
can make a difference, okay?

653
01:27:10,958 --> 01:27:16,005
This is the day you've waited for!
You get to stand up to the apes!

654
01:27:17,423 --> 01:27:18,674
Leo!

655
01:27:22,052 --> 01:27:25,014
You know you can't defeat Thade's army.

656
01:27:26,682 --> 01:27:30,561
We might confuse them.
It could give us a chance.

657
01:27:32,938 --> 01:27:37,901
You don't understand Thade.
He'll keep coming for you.

658
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:39,612
No matter what.

659
01:27:40,112 --> 01:27:42,114
That's what I'm counting on.

660
01:28:24,823 --> 01:28:26,408
Get behind the ship!

661
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,495
Get children behind the ship!

662
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:32,831
Come on, move! Now!

663
01:28:53,435 --> 01:28:54,812
- Let me go.
- No.

664
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:57,981
- Let me prove I can help!
- I need you here.

665
01:28:58,232 --> 01:29:00,025
Help clear them back.

666
01:29:24,508 --> 01:29:26,135
- What?
- I'm part of this!

667
01:29:26,343 --> 01:29:27,970
- Get back!
- No!

668
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,638
I'm staying!

669
01:29:39,731 --> 01:29:41,942
Send in the first wave.

670
01:29:48,323 --> 01:29:49,366
Here they come.

671
01:29:51,535 --> 01:29:52,828
Now!

672
01:30:06,049 --> 01:30:07,801
Oh, God.

673
01:30:35,787 --> 01:30:36,830
Come on.

674
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:57,392
Jesus!

675
01:31:05,609 --> 01:31:07,027
Come on.

676
01:32:01,081 --> 01:32:02,249
Wait.

677
01:32:22,769 --> 01:32:24,521
Now! Go!

678
01:32:39,286 --> 01:32:42,539
With that weapon,
we cannot defeat them!

679
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:59,222
I'm tired of this human.

680
01:34:14,673 --> 01:34:16,174
No! Wait!

681
01:35:17,986 --> 01:35:21,448
My fight is with Thade, not you!

682
01:35:21,698 --> 01:35:24,367
Then your fight is with me!

683
01:38:15,413 --> 01:38:17,081
Semos.

684
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:53,784
Pericles. A better landing than me.

685
01:38:58,164 --> 01:39:00,875
Sir, the prophecy is true.

686
01:39:01,083 --> 01:39:03,628
Semos has returned to us.

687
01:39:06,923 --> 01:39:08,090
Come on.

688
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:12,136
Let's go explain evolution
to the monkeys.

689
01:42:31,794 --> 01:42:33,879
He'll turn us into slaves!

690
01:42:34,171 --> 01:42:35,214
Kill him!

691
01:42:35,506 --> 01:42:38,509
Listen. This is where you're from.

692
01:42:38,717 --> 01:42:44,014
We brought you here. It's true.
We lived in peace together. Semos...

693
01:42:44,265 --> 01:42:46,100
...killed everybody.

694
01:42:51,939 --> 01:42:53,107
He's lying!

695
01:42:53,691 --> 01:42:54,817
Help me!

696
01:42:55,276 --> 01:42:58,654
My friend, kill him!

697
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:09,248
Everything I have believed is a lie!

698
01:43:09,665 --> 01:43:13,585
You and your family have betrayed us!

699
01:43:14,128 --> 01:43:16,922
I won't help you anymore.

700
01:43:25,556 --> 01:43:27,182
Ari...

701
01:45:18,293 --> 01:45:19,336
You okay?

702
01:45:20,087 --> 01:45:21,880
You came home.

703
01:45:22,172 --> 01:45:25,634
It's safe.
You can come out now.

704
01:45:28,387 --> 01:45:30,013
What? It's over?

705
01:45:30,305 --> 01:45:33,517
I was just getting ready
to make my move.

706
01:45:44,236 --> 01:45:47,155
We'll leave the graves unmarked.

707
01:45:47,364 --> 01:45:51,493
No one who comes will be able
to tell apes from humans.

708
01:45:51,702 --> 01:45:53,495
They'll be mourned together...

709
01:45:54,162 --> 01:45:57,749
...as it should be, from now on.

710
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:12,347
Take good care of him, okay?

711
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:16,810
I can promise you
I won't put him in a cage.

712
01:46:33,827 --> 01:46:36,747
It found the storm
that brought me here.

713
01:46:37,581 --> 01:46:38,999
You know...

714
01:46:39,541 --> 01:46:42,419
...it would mean much to everyone...

715
01:46:42,669 --> 01:46:44,463
...if you would stay.

716
01:46:48,008 --> 01:46:49,801
Would mean much to me.

717
01:46:50,969 --> 01:46:52,846
I have to leave now.

718
01:46:53,096 --> 01:46:55,140
I have to get back.

719
01:47:00,395 --> 01:47:03,690
You know, one day,
they'll tell a story...

720
01:47:03,899 --> 01:47:08,028
...about a human who came
from the stars...

721
01:47:08,695 --> 01:47:10,530
...and changed our world.

722
01:47:13,450 --> 01:47:16,369
Some will say it was just
a fairy tale...

723
01:47:19,498 --> 01:47:21,792
...that he was never real.

724
01:47:24,294 --> 01:47:26,129
But I'll know.

725
01:47:47,734 --> 01:47:48,568
Oh.

726
01:47:48,902 --> 01:47:49,945
Keep it.

727
01:47:50,862 --> 01:47:53,698
You know, I'd like to thank you...

728
01:47:53,907 --> 01:47:59,329
...for opening my eyes to a brave new
world of trade with the humans.

729
01:48:00,622 --> 01:48:02,040
Yeah, no problem.

730
01:48:02,415 --> 01:48:04,584
Farewell, spaceman.

731
01:48:05,126 --> 01:48:09,756
All right, kids, who wants
to buy some aspirin?

732
01:48:21,685 --> 01:48:23,395
Maybe you'll come back.

733
01:50:39,656 --> 01:50:44,786
<i>Z.D. C. Air Route Traffic
Control to unidentified aircraft.</i>

734
01:50:46,788 --> 01:50:49,374
<i>Unidentified craft, do you copy?</i>

735
01:50:49,791 --> 01:50:55,213
<i>- Copy that.
- You're entering restricted airspace.</i>

736
01:50:55,755 --> 01:50:58,508
<i>- Permission to land!
- You're off-target. Abort!</i>

737
01:51:00,552 --> 01:51:02,428
I can't!

738
01:52:24,177 --> 01:52:26,137
Stay where you are!

739
01:52:26,346 --> 01:52:28,348
Show your hands!

740
01:52:44,906 --> 01:52:46,699
Keep your hands up!
