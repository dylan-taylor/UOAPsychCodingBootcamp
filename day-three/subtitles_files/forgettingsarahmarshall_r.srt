00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,474
Hi.

175
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:43,893
Hi.

176
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,396
-Hi.
-Hi.

177
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:47,897
Hi.

178
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,569
Hi.

179
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,903
Hi.

180
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:59,701
Okay, do you mind not saying that
over and over again?

181
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,203
You can gag me.

182
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,542
You brought a gag?

183
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,878
And handcuffs.

184
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,713
Do you wanna gag me?

185
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,299
Kind of, now.

186
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,973
What've we got today?

187
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,933
Just a walk and
talk at the lab.

188
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,105
<i>That's what 20 years
on Vice will do to you.</i>

189
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,275
<i>What've we got here?</i>

190
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,361
<i>The victim's penis was found
behind the AC unit.</i>

191
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,447
<i>Ouch!</i>

192
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,949
<i>Can you say "dicksicle"?</i>

193
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,870
<i>Let's do this.</i>

194
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,164
Okay, I'm ready.

195
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,543
<i>The victim's penis
was found behind the AC unit.</i>

196
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,213
(PLAYING UPBEAT MELODY)

197
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,966
Just go with
the usual stuff, maybe.

198
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,593
Something dark
and ominous.

199
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,553
Like losing your
penis is a bad thing.

200
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,142
Oh, you want dark
and ominous.

201
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,646
Come on, I got Allman Brother tickets,
I gotta get out of here!

202
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,484
<i>That's what 20 years
on Vice will do to you.</i>

203
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,527
<i>What've we got here?</i>

204
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,364
Peter! Peter,
Jesus Christ!

205
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,034
You're fucking Billy Baldwin,
aren't you?

206
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,453
-Aren't you?
-Pete, Pete, Pete.

207
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,956
-Stop staring at me.
-Pete!

208
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,710
You know you're not getting paid
for today's session, right?

209
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,712
-I'm aware of that.
-Fucking asshole.

210
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,506
(BANGING ON DOOR)
BRIAN: Peter!

211
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,758
Hey, don't walk away
from me.

212
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,510
You come close.

213
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,180
Your place
is disgusting, Peter.

214
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,474
Hey, don't walk
away from me.

215
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,268
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

216
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,978
What are you burning, man?
Come on.

217
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,145
It's everything.

218
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,940
It's everything that reminds me
of her and I need it gone!

219
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,484
Okay, I thought I was
fine, Brian, and I'm not.

220
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,278
I'm not fine at all.

221
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,281
Okay, let's just
put the picture down.

222
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,367
Put that down.
Let's discuss this.

223
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,286
-I love her, man.
-I know.

224
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:12,417
Look, Liz and I,
we think the world of Sarah.

225
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,544
We think she's great.

226
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,963
Okay, but everything...

227
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,173
I'm just being
honest here.

228
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,552
Every time she would
come over to our house,

229
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,430
she always acted,

230
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,892
you know,
like a little bitch!

231
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,937
Okay, okay,
pump the brakes.

232
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:36,316
Dating Sarah is not
like dating Liz. Okay?

233
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,359
Sarah is better than Liz.

234
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,237
You really wanna
have this conversation?

235
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,866
Do you really wanna have
this conversation?

236
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,619
-Yes.
-She is the mother of my unborn child.

237
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,164
-Sorry.
-You're my stepbrother. We're not even blood.

238
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,957
I have no qualms
with sticking you.

239
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,542
I will equalize you.

240
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,419
-Sorry.
-You dick!

241
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,171
I'm just worked up.

242
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,549
You gotta get your
shit together, man.

243
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,635
I'm trying to.
It's so hard here.

244
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,180
Brian, everywhere I look,
I'm reminded of her, okay?

245
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,099
Like, she got me this,

246
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,853
okay, because I would always leave
my cereal boxes open,

247
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,313
and the cereal
would get stale,

248
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,191
and so one day I came home,
and she had this waiting for me,

249
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,318
because it keeps
my cereal fresh.

250
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,570
And now I have
the freshest cereal.

251
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,575
Why don't you, you know what,
go on a vacation?

252
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,327
Go to the Alps.

253
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,330
-Alps?
-Go to Gstaad. It's the best.

254
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,748
I could go to Hawaii.

255
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,166
Sarah was always
talking about this place

256
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,626
in Hawaii that was
supposed to be nice.

257
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,419
No, don't.
I wouldn't go there.

258
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,004
What, I can't go to
Hawaii now,

259
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,131
because Sarah Marshall
has heard of Hawaii?

260
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,634
Then go to Hawaii.
Go to Hawaii.

261
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,302
Do it.

262
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,473
(MUMBLING)

263
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,018
No, no, no,
don't destroy the computer.

264
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,436
I'm just
deleting these pictures.

265
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,064
Okay, I need them
off my computer.

266
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,902
You know what? You're not even doing
a proper permanent delete.

267
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,237
Well...

268
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,655
If we end up
getting back together,

269
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,115
I wanna have
a few of them left.

270
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,282
You're crazy.

271
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,826
-No, no, please don't delete them.
-They have to go.

272
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,620
(SCREAMING)
Done, done.

273
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,091
<i>Aloha!</i>

274
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,136
Check in this way.

275
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,691
-Just married?
-Yes, how did you guess?

276
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,528
Oh, you've got that
magic newlywed dust all over you.

277
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,697
Oh, my wife.

278
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,073
Oh, my husband.

279
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,908
-Oh, my wife.
-My husband.

280
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,952
My old ball and chain.

281
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,667
You quit squirming
and come here.

282
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,670
What is into you?

283
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,964
Not me, yet.

284
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,008
Here is your room key.

285
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,093
So you're all set. Room 222.

286
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,262
Room key's inside,
and the elevators are to the right.

287
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,555
<i>Mahalo.</i>

288
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,223
Congratulations.

289
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,936
Here you go, sir.
Have some POG juice.

290
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,980
Welcome to Turtle Bay.
What can I do for you?

291
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,357
I'm checking in. My name's Bretter,
Peter Bretter,

292
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,651
but actually,
I don't have a reservation.

293
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,237
I just thought
I'd take my chances.

294
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,282
Bold!

295
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,453
We are all booked up, but we do have
the Kapua suite available.

296
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,413
Okay. How much is that?

297
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,873
$6,000 a night.

298
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,876
-Wow.
-Beautiful views.

299
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,002
I can imagine.

300
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,128
That's a little bit
out of my price range.

301
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,880
Sorry.

302
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,424
That's a shame.
This is a beautiful

303
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,469
hotel.

304
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,306
Oh, yeah, it's Sarah Marshall
from <i>Crime Scene.</i>

305
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,392
People are excited
that she's here.

306
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,270
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We broke up three weeks ago.

307
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,773
I'm sorry, sir.

308
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,316
-Right. This is fine, right?
-Sir?

309
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,276
It's totally fine.
Okay, there she is.

310
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,531
-Did she see me?
-Uh-huh.

311
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,157
-Is she coming over here?
-Yup.

312
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,909
I wish I wasn't
wearing this fucking shirt.

313
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,994
Fair enough. Why don't you
try to unbutton it?

314
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,332
Button it back up.

315
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,126
-Peter!
-Hey.

316
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:25,836
Hi.

317
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,004
What are you doing here?

318
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,423
Came here to murder you.

319
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,926
Really, what are you
doing here?

320
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,472
l have been having a tough time,
you know, back in LA.

321
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,600
But then I came here,
and here you are.

322
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,353
I just think that's
too crazy to be...

323
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,981
Hello there,
you little sex object.

324
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,315
I've lost a shoe.

325
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,733
Have you
seen it anywhere?

326
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,988
It's like this one, but, you know,
obviously it's the opposite one.

327
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,908
Excuse me,
missus, I've lost a shoe.

328
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,578
Like this one.
It's like this one's fellow.

329
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,914
-Sort of the exact opposite, in fact, of that.
-RACHEL: Uh-huh.

330
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,375
Not an evil version,
but just, you know,

331
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,502
a shoe like this,
but for the other foot.

332
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,713
Otherwise,
I'd have two right...

333
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,256
Aldous, this is Peter.

334
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,216
Hey, all right, Peter.

335
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,218
Nice to meet you, mate.
Aldous.

336
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,470
Good to meet you, man.

337
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,638
My ex-boyfriend.

338
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,890
Right.
Hey, I'm Aldous Snow.

339
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,393
I know who you are.
Yeah, you're very, very famous.

340
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,478
Yeah, I am.
I am for my sins.

341
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,023
So are you
staying here, as well?

342
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,482
-I'm not, as a matter of fact...
-I'm sorry.

343
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,110
Excuse me, Mr. Bretter,
Ms. Marshall,

344
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:35,573
but we were able to book the
Kapua suite for you, sir, for four nights.

345
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,994
-You were?
-Yes, sir.

-Marvelous.
-Perfect. Perfect amount of time.

347
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,751
Listen, if you wanna have dinner
with us one of those nights...

No.

That's very gentlemanly of you,
but you two enjoy your trip.

351
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,966

Thank you.
Thank you for bailing me out.

357
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,524
I still can't
afford that room.

358
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,110
Nobody can. It's for, like, Oprah or,
like, Céline Dion.

359
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,487
Really, it's not a big deal.

360
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,114
So you can stay in the suite,
but since you're not technically a guest,

361
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,367
you have to clean
up after yourself.

362
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,078
Otherwise,
here is your room key

363
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,914
and enjoy your stay.

364
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,541

doing this for me?

365
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,587
She's here with
some guy already?

366
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,255
Kind of messed up.

367

-Right?
-Yeah.

368
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,302

-Really, it's not a big deal.

<i>Are there other

375
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,232
(WHISPERING) Of course
there are other hotels,

376
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,359

it'll look like I'm running away.

377
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,486
Wait. Why are you whispering?
You're not following them, are you?

378
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,030
I had a girlfriend,
right?

379
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:02,201
And Liam and Noel Gallagher
both had it off with her right in front of me,

380
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,703
so that's similar.

381
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,287
And that was
a bit awkward, actually.

382
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,332
So if you do wanna change hotels,
I quite understand.

383
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,918
No, no, I'm not
changing hotels.

384

00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,647
I'm on <i>Sex and the City.</i>

518
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,691
What's up, Miranda?

519
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,738
I'm Samantha.
I have sex with everyone.

520
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,823
Maybe it's a good
thing that they're here.

521
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,826
You know what I mean?
Maybe this is a challenge from God

522
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,995
for me to forget her.
You know?

523
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,374
Or maybe it's a sign from God
that you should be with her.

524
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,919
I love her show.

525
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:30,589
When they mix the sexuality
and the violence, I like it.

526
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,175
What the hell is wrong with you two?
You gotta move on.

527
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,469
I hear you say that,
but it's not that easy.

528
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,429
It's that easy.
Promise you it is.

529
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,306
I lived in South Central.

530
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,226
South Central.
And I hated it.

531
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,602
That's why
I moved to Oahu.

532
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,938

over 200 different kinds of fish.

-Oh, yes, I can.

534
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,191
-Do it.
-Yeah, you cannot.

00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,034
Yeah, bitch.

00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,202
Hey.

540
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,411
You ready?

541
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:02,746
Yeah, just gonna
close up.

Mr. Brayden.

sir?

544
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,714
She is in bed.

545
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,800
How are things
going with the lady?

546
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:19,054
Not awesome. She's complicated,
like <i>The Da Vinci Code,</i>

547
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,766
you know,
but harder to crack.

548
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,894
But life is full of lessons.

549
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,938
You learn
something new every day.

550
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,359
Wonder what I'm going
to learn tomorrow.

551
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,903

-Good night.

the mythical clitoris.

555
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,580
So, Peter,

556
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,416
were you able to get
that crying lady out of your room?

557
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,210
'Cause I could
send someone up, if you want.

558
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,171
-Oh, you could?
-Yeah.

559
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,716
That's very funny. It is.

560
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,971

561
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,807
I do the music
for that program.

562
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,519

that the music rocks?

563
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,814
That's very sweet of you.

564
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,691
That's very
sweet of you to say.

565
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,860
You don't have to say that, though.
It's not music.

566
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,654
There's no melody,
it's just tones.

567
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,240
Just dark, ominous tones.

What about,

It means Chuck.

I plugged it into a database.

There's a thing you can go on,
on the Internet,

622
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,864
you just type in your name,

623
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,200
and it just says it.

624
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,826

Because he's a man
like anyone else.

He just wants
to be loved.

896

to a human woman,

897
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,350
he ends up
smothering and killing her,

898

-It's true.

1036
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:52,299
Don't waste your time, man.
Believe me, it is a nowhere road. I know.

1037
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,801

her ex-boyfriend?

1038
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,386
He is ridiculous.

1039
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,721
Who, Greg?
I love Greg, man.

1040
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,558
I saw him beat up
a guy with a starfish.

1041
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,142
Okay, that's just
ridiculous.

1042
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:03,727
That guy was me.

1043
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,730
Dude, my homie over here,
on his honeymoon?

1044
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:09,400
Getting as much sex
as he possibly can ever have.

1045
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,235
Are you giving to her
hard and rough, dude?

1046
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,861
Come on.

1047
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:20,077
The wife wants me to do certain things
that I find inappropriate.

1048
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,038
Let me just say that if God was
a city planner,

1049
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:27,001
he would not put a playground
next to a sewage system.

1050
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:33,257
We're trying to fuck,
but we're not having fun fucking.

1051
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,344
We're just, like...
I'm stabbing her private parts,

1052
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,346
and it's not fun,
and it causes anxiety.

1053
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,390
Fucking is...

1054
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,144
And then when
you're not fucking...

1055
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,520

someone's gotta stop him.

1056
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,938

Hi, do you wanna
come back to bed?

1062
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,828
Sure.

1063
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,082
Have fun.

1064
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,252
I like her hair.

1065
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,463

matches her pubes.

Oh.

That's good, 'cause
that's what you wanted.

00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,411
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1073
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:50,834
It's just... I guess I thought
we had another year left.

1074
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,128
It seems like we did, and...
This'll be good,

1075
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:56,340
'cause it's been a long-awaited
transition into film for me.

1076
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,050
Don't get me wrong,
but it's just...

1077
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,760
It's a surprise.

1078
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,512
Come on tour with me.

1079
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:06,475

I didn't know you
were going on tour.

1081
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,603
Yeah, I'm going
in two weeks.

1082
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:13,732
It's like an 18-month tour,
43 countries, Infant Sorrow,

1083
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:15,943
and it's gonna
be a massive tour.

1084
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,529
Yeah. I can't come
'cause I have a job.

1085
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:21,198
I'm a working actress.

1086

Not anymore.

1087
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,619
You're an unemployed
actress, perfect.

1088
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:30,457
You could be the queen of the groupies,
queen of the Sorrow Suckers.

1089
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,876
The Sorrow Suckers.

1090

why they call them that.

Mr. and Mrs. Snow, sorry.

1092
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:39,842
Sorry to bother you.

1093
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,178
The hotel wanted to offer you some
complimentary coconut cake.

1094
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:46,640
It's from the hotel. It's definitely not
from me personally, so...

00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:49,560
Yeah, thanks.

1096
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:50,686
Okay, great.

00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,106
When were you
planning on telling me this?

1098
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,941
I just told you, then.

1099
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,818
Yeah. No, I know.

1100
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:02,740
But telling me now isn't really
the same as telling me.

1101
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,617
Well, look, you know, I've not told you
I've got genital herpes,

1102
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,078
because it's not
inflamed at the moment.

1103

1104
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,582
or do you want it
without your cake?

00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,333
ALDOUS: I don't drink.

1106

All right, so I came here
to give you my demo. I just...

1107

I worship you, and I just wanted
to give you my demo.

really interesting news this morning.

What's up?

1125

1126

1127
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,917
Wow.

-You all right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

1129
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,385
I mean, I've been waiting
to take the next step,

1130
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,304
you know, into features for a long
time, so it's a really good thing.

This isn't <i>The View.</i>

1132
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,433
I mean, we can have an honest talk
about this if we want.

1133
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,939
I don't wanna step out of the spotlight
and then be forgotten.

1134
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,608
I don't wanna disappear.
I'm freaked out.

1135
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:04,361
I wanna be honest. I'm really freaked
out right now, okay?

1136
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:08,448
Because, seemingly, the only actresses
that actually can survive

1137
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,992
are the ones that
show their cooter,

1138
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,577
and, excuse me,
but I refuse to do that.

1139

I have a little dignity.

1140
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:15,998
And I don't have the frame to
support plastic surgery. I would tip over.

1141
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,165

Just tell me
specifically what I need to do.

1176
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:46,213
You need to penetrate deeply
and stimulate the clitoris simultaneously.

That's what you gotta do.
That's what it's about.

the anus in that,

00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,923
<i>LIZ: No.</i>

1204
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:34,177
I would really love to get the woman's
perspective on the matter.

1205
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:35,762
<i>-Really?</i>
-No

1206
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,556
But come on in
and just sit down.

1207
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,890
<i>Stay. You have to…</i>

1208
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,267
<i>Honey, no,
no, the camera's right there.</i>

1209
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,476
<i>No, I know, but I just wanna
tell him, though.</i>

1210
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,644
<i>No, the camera…</i>

1211
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,021
<i>Think about how
much she's hurt you.</i>

1212
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,439
-Hey, Liz?
<i>-Yeah?</i>

1213
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,732
I think you need to
move just a tiny bit

1214
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:48,025
further away
from the microphone.

1215
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,151
<i>-Just…</i>
-No, closer.

1216
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,193
-Now a little further.
<i>-Okay.</i>

1217
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,319
-Closer.
<i>-And then…</i>

1218
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,155
-And then a little further, and then closer.
<i>-I don't know.</i>

1219
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,489
-Keep your head down, though.
<i>-I'm bad at this thing.</i>

1220
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:57,117
<i>-Can you hear me?</i>
-Yeah, closer. Further away.

1221
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,201
<i>I know what
you're doing.</i>

1222
00:58:58,285 --> 00:58:59,786
<i>That's not funny
at all.</i>

1223
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,288
<i>You stop that.</i>

1224
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,289
What?

1225
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,916
<i>-What's he doing?
-Come on. Yeah, yeah, real funny.</i>

1226
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,418
Hey, that's a great
necklace, Liz.

1227
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,545
<i>-Thank you!</i>
-Did you have that a second ago?

1228
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,214
<i>That's gross!</i>

1229
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:12,466
<i>-LIZ: I don't get it.
-Stop it.</i>

1230
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,761
Hey, Dracula!

1231
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:20,348
"And when I see Van Helsing,
I swear to the Lord, I'II slay him."

1232
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:21,475
(GROWLS)

1233
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,186
That shit is funny, dude!

1234
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,812
Hey, Pete.

1235
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:29,232
So I was gonna go over
to Lazy Joe's later tonight,

1236
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:32,110
and I wanted to see
if you wanted to come and join.

1237
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:34,905
I think I'm confused,
because I thought last night...

1238
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,823
Oh, my God.
Dude, get out of your head.

1239
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,742
It's really nice out here.

1240
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,578
Yeah, I bet it is.

1241
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:42,746
All right, yeah.
You know what?

1242
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,247
I could totally use
a friendly hangout, so...

1243
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,373
All right.

1244
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,917
I don't know if you want,
instead of Lazy Joe's,

1245
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,960
I was thinking of going
to Laie Point right now.

1246
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,253
-Really?
-Yeah.

1247
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,798
I heard that place
was a pain in the ass.

1248
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:55,258
RACHEL: Okay.

1249
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:57,552
-Hey!
-DWAYNE: Yo, what's up, guys?

1250
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:58,762
PETER: We're just
going for a hike.

1251
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,515
No, you're not,
you're going snorkeling.

1252
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,974
PETER: I think we're
gonna go on a hike.

1253
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:06,228
DWAYNE: It is sea turtle
fucking season, dude. Let's go.

1254
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,896
They fuck for
three hours, dude.

1255
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,606
I mean, that's magical.

1256
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,566
-No, we're going on a hike.
-I think we'll go on a hike, yeah.

1257
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,485
What? Your loss.

1258
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,696
Why won't anybody
go snorkeling with me?

1259
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:25,038
How you doing back there?

1260
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,415
Awesome.

1261
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:30,794
I don't think I've ever been
this covered in sweat before.

1262
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,921
It's like I have
some sort of fever.

1263
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,048
I told you this was
a pain in the ass.

1264
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,259
Could've been
at Lazy Joe's.

1265
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,927
Oh, yeah.

1266
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,679
PETER: Oh, shit.

1267
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,514
-You good?
-No.

1268
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,391
(LAUGHING)

1269
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,228
PETER: Wow, we're really going
up to the edge of this, huh?

1270
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,646
Look!

1271
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,820
Wow, this is
really beautiful.

1272
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,533
All right,
so now that your show's done,

1273
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,952
are you gonna finish
the Dracula musical?

1274
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,246
It's not that easy,
you know.

1275
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,916
Sarah always thought
it was crazy, and...

1276
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,294
Well,
you're definitely crazy.

1277
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:14,754
But so is everyone, right?
So who cares?

1278
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,464
I just don't feel
like doing anything.

1279
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,258
Why?

1280
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,551
'Cause my heart
is broken,

1281
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,429
and I can't imagine
doing anything right now.

1282
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:26,474
It's probably the same reason
you don't go back to school, you know?

1283
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:32,772
Maybe it's good we
got hurt like that, you know?

1284
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:38,111
I don't know about you,
but it makes me feel impervious to pain.

1285
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:41,781
Yeah. Kind of like
there's nothing left to be afraid of.

1286
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,116
Yeah. No, exactly.

1287
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,492
Right.

1288
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:48,830
We could leap off this rock,
and it won't hurt us as bad as they did.

1289
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,876
So jump, then.

1290
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,295
No, I meant that,
like, as a metaphor, you know?

1291
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,464
No. Just do it.

1292
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:03,261
You'll be fine. Jump.

1293
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,019
What the hell?

1294
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:16,066
Oh, God! Oh, God.
I made her kill herself!

1295
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,112
(EXCLAIMING)

1296
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,240
You must be crazy!

1297
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:24,699
So are you
gonna jump or what?

1298
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,243
No!

1299
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:27,994
Come on, Peter!

1300
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,788
I can see your
vagina from here!

1301
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:32,582
I can see your hoo-ha.

1302
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,001
I mean, I'll jump!

1303
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:37,170
Chicken! Come on!

1304
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:43,510
(GROANING)

1305
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,974
(SHOUTING)

1306
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,940
Please, God,
don't let me die today.

1307
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,443
-I'm okay!
-Okay!

1308
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:01,945
I'll just let go, right?

1309
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,446
No, no, no!

1310
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:07,867
If you fall straight down, you'd probably
hit a rock and kill yourself!

1311
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,870
-Totally.
-Yeah.

1312
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,122
So what do I do?

1313
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,958
Why don't you press your feet
up against the rock,

1314
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,043
and, like,
shoot yourself off!

1315
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,795
-What, like a frog?
-I don't know, Peter!

1316
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:21,506
Just get off
the fucking rock!

1317
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,716
Here I go!

1318
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:23,967
Okay!

1319
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,343
PETER: One!

1320
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,346
Two!

1321
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,223
Two!

1322
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:33,977
Two and a half!

1323
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:35,145
Jump!

1324
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,646
Three!

1325
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:53,705
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1326
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,623
-You saw that, right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw it!

1327
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:58,084
I was there.
I witnessed it.

1328
01:03:58,168 --> 01:03:59,586
Thanks.

1329
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:07,802
Come on.

1330
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,563
You've got Christ
between your thighs,

1331
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,858
but with a shorter beard.

1332
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:23,610
<i>Mahalo.</i>

1333
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:25,070
<i>Aloha.</i>

1334
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:26,571
Sex!

1335
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,822
I'm cramping, I'm cramping.

1336
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:29,115
-Okay.
-Okay, okay.

1337
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,204
Petey? Petey?

1338
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:40,752
Sorry. I knocked a bunch.

1339
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,545
You were really out.

1340
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:43,630
Ken sent me.

1341
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,383
Dakota Farming and her people,
they need this room.

1342
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:47,467
Oh.

1343
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,720
So does that mean I
have to leave the hotel?

1344
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:52,597
Ken found you a room.

1345
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,599
I'll take it, yeah.

1346
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,643
I wanna hang out with
Rachel a little more.

1347
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:01,022
Are those sad tissues
or happy tissues?

1348
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:07,195
Maybe you should
just give me a minute.

1349
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:13,410
It was the only
room available!

1350
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,245
I'm sure it was!

1351
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,125
Hey, how's it going?

1352
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,418
It's all right.

1353
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:22,877
Really?

1354
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:25,171
I think you got some
pain behind those eyes.

1355
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,132
-A kind of pain that only...
-Okay, you know what?

1356
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,383
Let's cut the bullshit.

1357
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,427
I wanna stand up on
a wave before I leave.

1358
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:32,303
I don't think
you're ready yet, man.

1359
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:34,139
I'm ready to
ride giants, Koonu.

1360
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,433
I think you're ready.

1361
01:05:58,538 --> 01:05:59,873
Petey!

1362
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,087
-Hi.
-Hi.

1363
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:08,798
Miss Marshall,
what can I do for you?

1364
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,468
Is there a place to get good
sushi around here?

1365
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,720
Yeah. Yeah,
there's a really great place

1366
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,014
about five minutes
from here called Asuki.

1367
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,515
Perfect.

1368
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,184
-Do you want me to get you a map?
-Please.

1369
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:20,518
Okay.

1370
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:24,564
So, this is where we are.

1371
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:28,693
Head down Kamehameha, and then pass
Funaho Loko Marsh.

1372
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,695
And it should be
right to the left.

1373
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,947
It might take,
like, five minutes.

1374
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,782
Great. Thank you.

1375
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:35,992
Any time.

1376
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,371
Um...

1377
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:44,167
-I saw you with Peter Bretter...
-Yeah.

1378
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,920
...who's my ex-boyfriend.

1379
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:50,256
Oh, my God.
I'm really sorry.

1380
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,758
-It's not like that at all.
-No.

1381
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,343
-It's not what you're…
-No, it's fine.

1382
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,345
I'm just really glad you're keeping
him company, 'cause...

1383
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:56,763
Gosh, no.

1384
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,223
...you seem like
a really nice person,

1385
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:01,017
-and you're very pretty.
-Thank you.

1386
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,561
Gosh, you're,
like, way prettier.

1387
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:06,022
No, you're, like,
so pretty.

1388
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,442
Really?

1389
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:13,112
-Yeah.
-Wow, thank you. Thank you.

1390
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,949
And one more
thing about Peter.

1391
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,952
He's a really good guy.
Really good.

1392
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:21,955
Like, great, actually.

1393
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:23,790
Yeah.

1394
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,250
Um...

1395
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:31,673
Please don't cry,
Miss Marshall.

1396
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:34,509
God. Do you need me
to get you a tissue?

1397
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:37,303
Oh, no, I'm good,
I'm good. I'm okay, I'm okay.

1398
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:39,639
Okay.

1399
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,476
Thank you, Rachel.

1400
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,478
Any time, Miss Marshall.

1401
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,490
Hey, ahoy, there!

1402
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,242
You surf, too?

1403
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,660
Good Lord, no.

1404
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,245
I'm just drifting around,
you know?

1405
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:04,455
Getting in touch with
the ocean and stuff.

1406
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,708
It's really pleasant.

1407
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,376
It was, yeah.

1408
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,212
I'm gonna head in.

1409
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:13,590
Before you go, actually, Peter,
I just wanted to tell you,

1410
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:16,009
l was listening to Sarah's
iPod the other day,

1411
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:19,929
and amidst the interminable dross
that's on that thing,

1412
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:22,181
I found one track
that I quite liked.

1413
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:25,310
So I checked what it was,
and it was actually one of yours.

1414
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:27,854
And it kind of
reminded me of a dark,

1415
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:30,481
gothic Neil Diamond.
It's great.

1416
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,776
That's, like,
exactly what I'm going for.

1417
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,403
Right, yeah.

1418
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,575
Fuck.

1419
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,037
Fuck, you're cool.

1420
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:50,293
It's so hard to say, because, like,
I hate you in so many ways,

1421
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,255
but whatever. I can see why
Sarah likes you.

1422
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,007
No accounting for taste,
I suppose.

1423
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,800
In her case, anyway.

1424
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:00,970
She was with me for five years,
so there you go.

1425
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:04,057
Yeah, you got four
on me there, mate.

1426
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:09,270
You slept with
Sarah a year ago?

1427
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:10,521
I thought you knew!

1428
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,982
Peter, please,
don't take it seriously.

1429
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:14,942
What the fuck, man! You've...

1430
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,778
Don't get
offended by that.

1431
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,280
You can't be so
casual about this!

1432
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:20,573
This isn't Europe, okay?

1433
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,991
There are rules here.

1434
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,159
I'm really sorry.

1435
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,161
I apologize for
offending you, Peter.

1436
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,873
I just hope this
doesn't ruin our friendship.

1437
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,375
Well, what's that about?

1438
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,293
What do you think it's about?
This is a big deal!

1439
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:34,170
What about a code of the ocean?
That's not on.

1440
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:35,505
What about codes
among men?

1441
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,173
You don't sleep with another
man's girlfriend!

1442
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,383
-Think of...
-Get out of here!

1443
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,635
-All right, okay! All right!
-Get out of here!

1444
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,412
Oh, God!

1445
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:31,811
PETER: Koonu!
This guy needs help! Koonu!

1446
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:33,646
(SCREAMING)

1447
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,357
Should I call
the front desk?

1448
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:37,942
It hurts. It hurts.

1449
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,319
Wow, you got coral
right there in your leg!

1450
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:41,904
Can you get it out
of my leg, please, hotel man?

1451
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:43,072
Can you do
something about that?

1452
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:45,908
I'd love to,
you know, but hotel policy...

1453
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,326
They don't let me do
that kind of thing.

1454
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,328
They get all weirded out.
Insurance...

1455
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:51,247
Koonu, can you call
the front desk for me, please?

1456
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,957
-Yeah.
-It really hurts.

1457
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,002
Koonu, call
the front desk now!

1458
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,087
Okay, monster man.

1459
01:10:58,171 --> 01:10:59,922
Pete, he's not gonna
do nothing.

1460
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:01,966
I kind of have this
thing about blood, okay?

1461
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,092
Look at it.
It's raping my leg.

1462
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:05,011
Peter, get it out of
my fucking leg, please!

1463
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:08,097
One, two.

1464
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,266
-You can't get it out.
-It's really in there.

1465
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:11,517
Get it out of me!

1466
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,769
Three!

1467
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:15,104
Fuck my arse!

1468
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:18,065
Okay, I got it.
It's all done. It's all over.

1469
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,692
Everything looks fine.

1470
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,698
It's all good!
They're coming <i>wiki wiki.</i>

1471
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:27,867
Can you get some
towels for me, please?

1472
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:30,036
I'm really
losing a lot of blood.

1473
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,121
(IN ENGLISH ACCENT)
You sound like you're from London.

1474
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,373
Yeah, I'm from London.

1475
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,506
What's going on?

1476
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:43,591
SARAH: You fainted.

1477
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,718
I didn't want you to
wake up by yourself.

1478
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,470
How's your friend?
Is he all right?

1479
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,263
Yeah.

1480
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:51,682
They gave him stitches,
and he's sleeping it off.

1481
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,893
-Hey, you wanna hear something funny?
-What?

1482
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:56,187
Are you ready to laugh?
'Cause this is a gas.

1483
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,522
Okay.

1484
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:59,232
Edward Scissorhands
over there told me

1485
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,025
that you two were
fucking each other

1486
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,903
for a whole God damn year
while we were together.

1487
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:04,987
Shit.

1488
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,781
How about that, Sarah?

1489
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,658
I'm sorry, Peter.

1490
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,662
Pete, you shouldn't be up
and walking around. Can you please...

1491
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:13,996
Please don't touch me.

1492
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:15,331
Just don't touch me,
okay?

1493
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,083
I'm not touching you.

1494
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,585
Will you just please sit?
Please?

1495
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:23,339
All right, I'II sit down,
but I'm sitting down 'cause I want to,

1496
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:27,510
not because you've
asked me to sit, okay?

1497
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,928
Great.

1498
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,102
A year?

1499
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:39,522
Listen, I get it, okay?
I just...

1500
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,567
I need to understand what I did
to make you cheat. I just...

1501
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:49,073
Pete, it's not
anything you did.

1502
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:51,617
You didn't do anything.

1503
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:52,952
I mean, you were great.

1504
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:55,746
Will you please cut the bullshit
and have a talk with me?

1505
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,708
Fine. Cutting the bullshit.

1506
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,751
It got really hard to
keep taking care of you

1507
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,879
when you stopped
taking care of yourself.

1508
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,213
I tried to get you
out of the house.

1509
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:09,135
I tried to get you off your little island
you loved so much, the couch.

1510
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,887
You didn't wanna
see the light of day!

1511
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:15,308
God, there was one week
when you wore sweatpants! Every day.

1512
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:23,816
You shall not pass!

1513
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:26,819
You know what? If they were
Sean John sweatpants,

1514
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,112
it would have been fine.

1515
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:29,655
But because
they're Costco brand,

1516
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,282
it's like the worst thing
I could do.

1517
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,408
That has nothing
to do with it.

1518
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,160
That's what you don't get.

1519
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,787
I'm sorry that
I didn't end up being

1520
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,706
who we thought I was
gonna be, you know?

1521
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:41,125
I tried really hard.
I promise you that.

1522
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,586
I just didn't have it in me.

1523
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:46,130
I think if you had just,
maybe tried harder.

1524
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:48,549
I tried!

1525
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:51,093
You have no idea how
hard I tried, Peter.

1526
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:52,803
I talked to a therapist.

1527
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:53,971
I talked to my mother.

1528
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,181
I read every book possible.

1529
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,391
I took love seminars.
I took sex seminars.

1530
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:58,684
None of it worked.

1531
01:13:58,809 --> 01:13:59,977
None of it made
a difference to you.

1532
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:03,522
And I couldn't
drown with you anymore.

1533
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:08,194
Don't you dare sit there
and tell me that I didn't try.

1534
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:10,321
I did.

1535
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,990
You were just too
stupid to notice.

1536
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:45,731
(CLEARS THROAT)

1537
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:48,901
Whoa. I thought you were gonna
wear the shirt I got you.

1538
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,695
What? No.

1539
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:53,489
I mean, I do love
that shirt you got me.

1540
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:56,200
I admire Sir Tommy
Bahama an awful lot.

1541
01:14:56,283 --> 01:15:00,329
He's a talented man, but tonight, I feel
that this is appropriate.

1542
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:08,921
Wow, thank you.
Yeah, Sarah got it for me.

1543
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:13,592
This is, like, way more convenient
than my backpack.

1544
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,221
(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)
Awesome hat!

1545
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:18,597
Thank you.

1546
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,057
Yeah,
my girlfriend got it for me!

1547
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,434
I'm fucking with you!

1548
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:22,768
Cool!

1549
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:30,484
Sarah, can I borrow
this lipstick?

1550
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,779
Sure. I don't care.

1551
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,034
I think it looks great.
But if you're not, let's go change.

1552
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:39,744
No, I like it.
I didn't like it at first.

1553
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:41,537
Now I really think it's...

1554
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,247
Oh, bloody hell.
This is a small resort.

1555
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,832
SARAH: Hi, Peter.

1556
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,461
Hey. Wow.

1557
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,964
Aldous,
Sarah, this is Rachel.

1558
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:54,508
Sarah bought me this shirt.

1559
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:55,926
I could've guessed that.
Yeah.

1560
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,178
-Looks great.
-You look great.

1561
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:59,096
Looks awesome.

1562
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,181
See.

1563
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:01,348
Thanks.

1564
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:03,517
Mr. Snow, I'm so sorry.

1565
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,686
I did not know you
guys were coming.

1566
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:06,812
You're gonna have
to wait five minutes.

1567
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:07,980
I did not know you
guys were coming.

1568
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,732
It's okay.
It's not a problem.

1569
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,567
I didn't see you guys, so...

1570
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:14,236
ALDOUS: There's
really no need to weep.

1571
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,530
I'm not crying.

1572
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,283
It's no problem, honestly.

1573
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,743
It's not a problem.

1574
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,913
-So, your table is ready, guys.
-Oh, great.

1575
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:25,498
Hey, have a lovely evening,
you two.

1576
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:27,416
-Thank you. Have a great dinner, you guys.
-Thank you.

1577
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,876
You're welcome to join us,
obviously, if you want.

1578
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:30,753
-Wouldn't dream of it. What?
-Okay.

1579
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,088
What?

1580
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,840
-Oh, okay.
-Okay.

1581
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:36,592
-RACHEL: That's great. Awesome.
-Sure.

1582
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:37,927
Great. I'll just
set two more places.

1583
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,095
-Okay.
-Not a big deal.

1584
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:40,596
Awesome.

1585
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,681
So this is
actually happening.

1586
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,183
We're gonna
let this happen.

1587
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,435
I am so sorry.

1588
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:49,480
I never thought in a million
years she would say yes.

1589
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:50,606
I did.

1590
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,108
What? I just
accepted an invitation.

1591
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,651
I didn't wanna be rude.

1592
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:55,444
It's got us in
a terrible situation.

1593
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,488
Now I'm gonna have to sit with him
wearing this shirt all night.

1594
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,281
You're wearing
the shirt regardless.

1595
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,075
Australia is amazing.

1596
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,370
-I'm telling you. It is a great place to shoot.
-Yeah?

1597
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,413
Rachel, you would love it.

1598
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:08,124
You would love it.

1599
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:10,918
I wanna go. I really,
really wanna go there.

1600
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,461
Wait, so when's
the movie coming out?

1601
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:16,090
It came out.

1602
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:18,634
-It was already released.
-Oh.

1603
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:19,927
(SNICKERING)

1604
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,721
Well, you know,
it's an island.

1605
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:23,848
It's isolated.

1606
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,349
-Yeah.
-Movies don't really come out here.

1607
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,226
-Obviously.
-Did you like it?

1608
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,854
-The movie?
-Yeah.

1609
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:32,857
-It was...
-Awful bloody film.

1610
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,151
I say, it's just
a ridiculous premise.

1611
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:38,863
What would happen if your mobile
phone killed you?

1612
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:41,240
Why would a mobile phone kill anyone?
Doesn't make sense.

1613
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:44,076
How can a mobile phone have
an agenda and kill people...

1614
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,744
I told her that when
she read the script.

1615
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,454
Yeah. You were
the voice of reason, mate.

1616
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,165
I tried to be,
but she didn't listen.

1617
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:50,541
Going around
killing people.

1618
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,959
A mobile phone,
like, doing murders.

1619
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,003
Why couldn't you just take the
battery out of the phone?

1620
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,421
ALDOUS: Right. That's it.
The battle's over.

1621
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,589
Yeah, we've won.

1622
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:57,756
ALDOUS: I hated it.

1623
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,967
Well, it's not for everyone,
but it...

1624
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,094
No, it's ridiculous.
Here's my favorite scene.

1625
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,846
Ring-ring. Hello?

1626
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:06,432
-ALDOUS: (LAUGHING) Right. It would never happen.
-Yeah.

1627
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:07,850
No, it could never happen.

1628
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:12,021
It's a metaphor for
addiction to technology.

1629
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:16,192
For society, for how we're
reliant on technology.

1630
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:17,359
I get it. I'm with you.

1631
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,944
It's a metaphor
for a crap movie.

1632
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:21,238
Well, it was the right choice
for me at the time.

1633
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:22,990
-RACHEL: Sure.
-You know?

1634
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:38,255
Well, this is awkward.

1635
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,176
Yeah?

1636
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:43,969
It's a bit more
awkward now.

1637
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,262
RACHEL: A little.

1638
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:46,722
PETER: Hey, excuse me.

1639
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:48,224
Can we get another
bottle of wine, please?

1640
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:49,516
-Sure.
-Thank you.

1641
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,601
Mr. Snow?

1642
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:53,020
Can I get cranberry juice
with a bit of lime in it, please.

1643
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:54,730
Do you want cranberry juice
or cranberry cocktail?

1644
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:55,981
Because I can probably
rustle up either one.

1645
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:57,274
Throw some OJ...

1646
01:18:57,358 --> 01:18:59,443
I don't care.

1647
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:00,986
Okay, great.

1648
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:12,873
Hey, can we get
another bottle of wine?

1649
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:24,343
If I've learned anything from
addiction, it's that,

1650
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:28,931
you know, life is as brief as the
twinkling of a star over all too soon.

1651
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,933
So if you're in a situation
where you're with a woman,

1652
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:32,685
why not do
the most interesting thing

1653
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,436
that you can do
in that situation?

1654
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,022
And by which, I don't mean
have a conversation,

1655
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:38,524
have a chin-wag,
a bit of a chat.

1656
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:41,986
Lose yourself in something
that's both ancient and perennial.

1657
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,196
Find something eternal,
perpetual.

1658
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:46,490
Lose yourself in fuck.

1659
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,494
I'm going to disagree.

1660
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,037
Respectfully,
of course, sir.

1661
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:54,164
Maybe for you, that works.

1662
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:57,459
For me, it's much more enjoyable
to get to know somebody.

1663
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,003
If you end up
sleeping with them, that's great.

1664
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:01,297
But I like getting
to know somebody.

1665
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,381
But he...

1666
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:06,844
What he's saying is that
he's gonna stick it wherever he wants,

1667
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:09,555
but he's joking.

1668
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,265
I ain't.
No, I'm not joking.

1669
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,851
It's just what I believe,
really.

1670
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:16,562
So...

1671
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:19,481
Just so we're clear
and so I can hone in

1672
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:22,318
on your central
thesis of the night,

1673
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:23,944
wade through
all the bullshit,

1674
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:26,655
you're telling me
that you think you have the right

1675
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:29,408
to just fuck anyone,
anywhere, anytime?

1676
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:31,452
-Yes. There it is. That's right.
-That's what you're saying?

1677
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:34,538
Not so eloquently
as you just put it, sweetheart.

1678
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:35,998
But ultimately,
yes, that is...

1679
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:38,042
Oh, no! Not the shirt!

1680
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:40,753
Take my eyes,
but not the shirt.

1681
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:44,631
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I believe, Sarah.

1682
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:47,176
When you're done making jokes,
are you gonna get a napkin?

1683
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,678
Do you know what? I think I've improved
it, actually, against all odds.

1684
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:51,055
I think I deserve
a design award.

1685
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:53,182
Please get some
seltzer water.

1686
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,309
Garçon,
could we get some...

1687
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,519
I saw it from farther away.

1688
01:20:57,603 --> 01:20:59,521
-Okay.
-Just lean back for a second.

1689
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,315
No, it's all right.
It's not there. Let me...

1690
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:02,858
You're very diligent.
I appreciate it.

1691
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,777
Let go of the glass now.
You're gonna have to walk away.

1692
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,612
Bless you.
There you are.

1693
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:08,739
Oh, me, oh, my.

1694
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,282
Call the doctor.

1695
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:11,658
Oh, good.

1696
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,416
(PETER MOANING)

1697
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:21,877
I love Hawaii.

1698
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,003
RACHEL: Is it good?

1699
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:27,174
Yeah, it's nice,
but I think for like a week tops.

1700
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:28,967
Any more than that,
I know I'd go crazy,

1701
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:32,846
because I think that
Hawaii is a place to escape

1702
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:35,974
for people who can't deal
with the real world.

1703
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,646
Yeah, you know,
there's so few

1704
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:43,232
personal shoppers
and pet therapists.

1705
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,484
Gosh, it's such a hard life.

1706
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:57,538
I like living here.

1707
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,083
Anyone need any more vino?

1708
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,001
I think we're good.

1709
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,422
I've a question for
you real quick, Mr. S.

1710
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:08,090
I was actually
meaning to ask you,

1711
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:09,758
what did you
exactly think of my demo?

1712
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:12,177
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

1713
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:15,055
Oh, no.
I was gonna listen to that,

1714
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:18,350
but then I just
carried on living my life.

1715
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:39,329
Wait, wait, wait.

1716
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:41,290
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1717
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:44,460
Are you sure that you're not,
like, too drunk?

1718
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:47,296
Jesus, would you
stop being so sensitive.

-Okay!

Excuse me?

01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,732
You should've seen yourself
at dinner, Sarah.

Then we come back here, and you
put on that ghastly performance.

women do fake orgasms,

Let me tell you something
about these tattoos, okay?

That is Buddhist.
That is Nordic.

1761
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:01,471
That is Hindu.
That's just gibberish.

1762

They are completely
conflicting ideologies.

or did you fake that?

Right. I'm gonna
probably clear off now.

sleep for a few hours,

in the morning, okay?

Am I okay? I'm better
than okay, my friend.

You seem sprightly.

I…

1803
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:14,998
I had a great
time last night.

-Thank you.

1805
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:20,295
What about you?
What's with the bag?

1806
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:23,799
Right, yeah. I'm off
back to England, mate.

1807
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:25,217
Oh, you and Sarah
are going to England.

I'm just going alone.

Yeah, it was really...

1811
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:34,100
How you served
five years under her, I don't know.

1812
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:36,436
You deserve
a medal or a holiday

1813
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:38,814
or at least
a cuddle from somebody.

1814
01:28:38,897 --> 01:28:40,524
You were only
here for a week.

1815
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:42,734
Well, I don't know.
For me, that one week of it

1816
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:45,070
was like going
on holiday with,

1817
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:47,405
I don't know,
I wouldn't say Hitler,

1818
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:49,115
but certainly Goebbels.

1819
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:50,909
It was like a little
holiday with Hitler.

1820
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:52,327
Jesus.

1821
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:56,122
Hey, listen, at least it's clear now
for you two to reconnect.

1822
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:57,249
Oh...

1823
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:00,669
No, no. No.

1824
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:03,171
You know what? I have a good thing
going on with Rachel,

1825
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:04,965
and I want to
see that through.

1826
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:06,675
Well, maybe you
could have both of them.

1827
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,468
Rachel and Sarah.

1828
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:09,928
They got on all right,
didn't they, at dinner?

1829
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:11,429
So maybe...

1830
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:13,849
You know what? First of all,
I'm not that kind of guy.

1831
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:16,226
And even if I was,
I don't think that I have

1832
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,645
the sexual competency
to really pull that off.

1833
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:20,313
Yeah. It's a gift.

1834
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:22,524
Okay. Well, I think
my ride's here.

1835
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:25,277
So I'm gonna skedaddle then
before anything else happens to me.

1836
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,028
Before life
gets any more daft.

1837
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,655
Is someone gonna take that?

1838
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:31,449
Listen, don't let
them grind you down.

1839
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:33,869
Take it easy.

1840
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,787
Hey, look at my driver.
I'm gonna have sex with her.

1841
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:43,837
He said it was
clear I wasn't over you.

1842
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:48,133
And then he left.

1843
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:49,759
Fucking prick.

1844
01:29:51,678 --> 01:29:54,973
And then I started thinking,
what if he's right?

1845
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,976
What if I'm not over you?

1846
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:02,272
-Sarah...
-Please just let me finish, Pete.

1847
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:12,991
What if I made a really,
really horrible mistake?

1848
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:17,537
-Sarah.
-Yeah?

1849
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:20,081
-Sarah.
-Yeah?

1850
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,626
Stop pulling my
face towards your face.

1851
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:24,419
Why?

1852
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:26,087
You don't like it?

1853
01:30:26,171 --> 01:30:28,423
Listen, pulling my shirt
towards you

1854
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:30,759
is the same concept
as pulling my face.

1855
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:33,553
Let's spend one more
night here together,

1856
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:35,096
and then let's go
home and then...

1857
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,098
And we'll just pretend
like it never happened.

1858
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,225
-That's the big plan?
-…face reality. No.

1859
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:41,061
No. I love you.

1860
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:42,687
That's not fair.

1861
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:44,356
That's not fair of
you to say that to me.

1862
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:47,776
Please, Peter.

1863
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:51,821
Tell me you're sorry.

1864
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:53,156
I'm so sorry.

1865
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:58,078
I missed you.

1866
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:04,542
I'm sorry.

1867
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:09,547
God, I missed you, Peter.

1868
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:18,014
All right.

1869
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:21,726
Get hard for me, Pete.
Get hard for me.

1870
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:23,103
I know what
I'm supposed to do.

1871
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:24,521
Okay.

1872
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:26,564
Just do it.
Come on. Get hard.

1873
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:28,274
-I'm trying.
-Okay.

1874
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,318
-Here. Just let me do it for a second.
-Okay.

1875
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:35,657
I really want you, Peter.
I missed you.

1876
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:37,117
You don't want help?

1877
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:39,452
-You don't want help?
-Can you be quiet just for a minute?

1878
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:41,705
Do you want my hands?

1879
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:45,083
Maybe just don't talk for
a second is what I mean.

1883

1884
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,560

1892

Excuse me.

1894
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:25,415
No, I haven't had
anything to drink today.

1895
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:32,338
Maybe the problem is that
you broke my heart into a million pieces,

1896
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:36,051
and so my cock doesn't want
to be around you anymore, okay?

1897

1898

Hey.

1903
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:05,622
Hey, Rachel.

1904
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:08,374
Sarah and Aldous
broke up this morning.

1905
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,959
What a surprise.

1906
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:12,837
So I went to
check on Sarah, and...

1907
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:18,051
Listen, I'm here because I don't want
to lie to you, okay?

1908
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:20,011
Some stuff happened.

1909
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:22,013
I'm really,
really sorry that it did,

1910
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:25,016
but I'm also really
glad that it did, because

1911
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,601
I'm able to see
so clearly now

1912
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,437
that Sarah and I are
not right for each other.

1913
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:32,440
What stuff?

1914
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:40,240
I went up to make sure that she
was okay, and it got weird.

1915
01:33:40,323 --> 01:33:42,117
But now everything
is fine.

1916
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,785
And I need you
to understand

1917
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:46,079
that I meant everything that I said
to you this morning.

1918
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:47,413
What exactly happened,
Peter?

1919
01:33:47,497 --> 01:33:49,040
We fooled
around a little bit.

1920
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:52,377
Shut the fuck up,
and tell me exactly what you did.

1921
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:56,881
All right.
I went to her room,

1922
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:59,884
and she was crying
and crying and crying.

1923
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:02,262
And I felt like
I should comfort her.

1924
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:05,682
And then she started kissing me
because I was comforting her.

1925
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:07,809
And then the next thing I
knew, I was kissing her

1926
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:10,019
because she had been kissing me
because of the comforting.

1927
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,980
Then she started
taking my clothes off,

1928
01:34:12,105 --> 01:34:14,023
and then her
clothes were off.

1929
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:20,905
Then she performed 10 to 15
seconds of oral sex on me.

1930
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:22,407
Okay. Peter,
you can leave now.

1931
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,825
At the most. Maximum.

1932
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,285
Thank you for
staying at Turtle Bay.

1933
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:26,369
Rachel,
please don't do this.

1934
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:28,872
The only reason I'm telling you this is
because I really care about...

1935
01:34:28,955 --> 01:34:30,999
Listen to me, Peter.

1936
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:34,127
I was a mess, too.
I understand. Okay?

1937
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:37,505
But it does not excuse
you acting like a complete asshole.

1938
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:40,300
Listen, I know that
I fucked things up for a minute,

1939
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:42,010
but I'm not like
every other asshole.

1940
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:45,680

with anybody right now.

01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:25,723
Yeah, you know, I'm kind of
checking out some schools.

2051
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:27,933
Congratulations.

2052
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:29,477
Yeah, maybe.

2053
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:34,231
You never called.

2054
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:38,819
You told me not to.
And I listened.

2055
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:40,946
Right.

2056
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:42,114
Wasn't easy.

2057
01:42:42,198 --> 01:42:44,659
I might have
called once and hung up.

2058
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:46,744
-No. No.
-From a private number.

2059
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:49,121
No.

2060
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:50,998
Maybe.

2061
01:42:51,082 --> 01:42:52,083
MAN 1: Peter!

2062
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:53,334
MAN 2: Nice job, Bretter.

2063
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:54,543
Well, you should
probably go back.

2064
01:42:54,627 --> 01:42:56,837
Would you like to hang out
while you're here?

2065
01:42:56,921 --> 01:42:58,047
Maybe we could
go to dinner or...

2066
01:42:58,172 --> 01:42:59,340
Yeah.

2067
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:01,717
-Still have my number?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.

2068
01:43:01,801 --> 01:43:03,094
Go.

2069
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:04,512
Yeah, I should do that.

2070
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:06,514
Yeah, yeah. Go mingle.

2071
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:11,811
-MAN 1: Hey, Peter!
-MAN 2: Hey, Bretter!

2072
01:43:11,894 --> 01:43:13,521
Come over here
and meet my mom!

2073
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:14,897
Go, go.

2074
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:16,273
Off I go.

2075
01:43:16,357 --> 01:43:17,983
-MAN 1: Hey, Peter.
-MAN 2: Nice job, Bretter.

2076
01:43:18,067 --> 01:43:20,027
The play was sick, man.
Good work.

2077
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:21,112
Nice job.

2078
01:43:21,278 --> 01:43:22,279
Good job, man.
That was awesome.

2079
01:43:22,363 --> 01:43:23,531
So cool!

2080
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:25,533
Peter, congratulations.

2081
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:27,284
I just wanted
to say thank you.

2082
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,078
I had such
a great time tonight.

2083
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:31,497
Oh, good. You know what?
I'm gonna change out of this unitard,

2084
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:33,457
-'cause I'm getting a chafe. Okay.
-Enough said.

2085
01:43:33,541 --> 01:43:34,542
Congratulations.

2086
01:43:34,667 --> 01:43:35,668
Thank you.

2087
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:03,279
Hey, Peter?

2088
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:09,618
I was just calling you.

2089
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:16,000
Wow.

2090
01:44:16,125 --> 01:44:17,168
Oh, Peter.

2091
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,336
I'm sorry.

2092
01:44:19,503 --> 01:44:20,921
Stop laughing.

2093
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:23,632
Can you please
stop laughing?

2094
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:27,887
I missed you.

2095
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:32,308
I just... You know,
I actually wanted to tell you

2096
01:44:32,433 --> 01:44:34,685
that I've been
thinking so much about...

2097
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:29,281
<i>NARRA TOR: This fall, Sarah Marshall is
back in a brand-new role.</i>

2098
01:45:29,365 --> 01:45:33,160
Your wife had no enemies
that you're aware of.

2099
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:35,830
<i>NARRATOR: Get ready for the most
daring show on television.</i>

2100
01:45:35,913 --> 01:45:37,540
Just came home,
and she was lying there.

2101
01:45:37,665 --> 01:45:39,250
Right.

2102
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:42,670
<i>NARRATOR: In a world where you
don't know who to trust.</i>

2103
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:46,006
(YELPS)

2104
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:49,009
Charlie,
who's Franco Marconi?

2105
01:45:49,093 --> 01:45:50,553
No. No.

2106
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:52,179
Gun, gun, gun, gun.
Drop it, drop it.

2107
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:54,765
<i>NARRATOR: Go with
your animal instincts.</i>

2108
01:45:54,849 --> 01:45:56,350
<i>(DOG HOWLING)</i>

2109
01:45:58,644 --> 01:46:02,106
-How did you know?
-She's an animal psychic.

2110
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:06,485
<i>NARRATOR: Sarah Marshall
returns on</i> Animal Instincts.

2111
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:08,362
Life's a bitch.

2112
01:46:08,445 --> 01:46:11,365
And where you're going,
that's exactly what you'll be.
