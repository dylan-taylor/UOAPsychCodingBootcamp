1
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:21,094
People do not give it credence
that a young girl could leave home

2
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:24,000
and go off in the winter time
to avenge her father's blood.

3
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,992
But it did happen.

4
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:28,262
I was just fourteen years of age

5
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:31,728
when a coward by the name of
Tom Chaney shot my father down.

6
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:34,626
And robbed him of
his life, and his horse.

7
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:38,255
And two California gold pieces
that he carried in his trouser band.

8
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,369
Chaney was a hired man.

9
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,308
And Papa had taken
him up to Fort Smith

10
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,273
to help lead back a string of
mustang ponies he'd bought.

11
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:50,160
In town, Chaney
had fallen to drink,

12
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:53,587
and cards, and
lost all his money.

13
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,178
He got it into his head
he'd been cheated,

14
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:59,556
and went back to the boarding
house for his Henry rifle.

15
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:02,241
When Papa tried to intervene,

16
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:04,191
Chaney shot him.

17
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,242
Chaney fled.

18
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,759
He could have walked his horse,

19
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,461
for not a soul in that city could
be bothered to give chase.

20
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,394
No doubt Chaney fancied
himself scott free.

21
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:24,573
But he was wrong.

22
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:28,284
You must pay for everything in
this world, one way or another.

23
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:30,869
There is nothing free

24
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,587
except the grace of God.

25
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,215
Is that the man?

26
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:26,205
That is my father.

27
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,205
If you would like to kiss him,

28
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,389
it would be all right.

29
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,857
He has gone home.

30
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:34,420
Praise the Lord.

31
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,211
Why is it so much?

32
00:03:36,212 --> 00:03:38,005
The quality of the casket

33
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:39,642
and of the embalming.

34
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:42,902
The lifelike appearance
requires time and art.

35
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:46,957
And the chemicals come dear.
The particulars are in your bill.

36
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:51,814
If you'd like to kiss him,
it would be all right.

37
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,726
Thank you, the spirit has flown.

38
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:55,544
Your wire said fifty dollars.

39
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:58,280
You did not specify that
he was to be shipped.

40
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:01,660
Well sixty dollars is every cent we have.
That leaves nothing for our board.

41
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:05,624
Yarnell, you can see to the body's transport
to the train station and accompany it home.

42
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,012
I will have to sleep here tonight.

43
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,723
I still have to collect father's things
and see to some other business.

44
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:12,733
Your mama didn't say nothing
about you settling no business here.

45
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:15,976
It's business Mama didn't know about.
It's all right, Yarnell, I dismiss you.

46
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:16,889
I am not sure.

47
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,866
Tell Mama not to sign
anything until I return home

48
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:21,161
and see that Papa is buried
in his Mason's apron.

49
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:24,853
Your terms are agreeable,
if I may pass the night here.

50
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:27,795
Here, among these people?

51
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:32,574
- These people?
- I'm expecting three more souls.

52
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:37,294
Sullivan, Smith, and
His-Tongue-in-the-Rain.

53
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:40,306
Ladies and gentlemen, beware.

54
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,810
And train up your children in
the way that they should go.

55
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:46,194
You see what has become of me.

56
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:47,680
Because of drink,

57
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,579
I killed a man.

58
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:53,965
In a trifling quarrel
over a pocket knife.

59
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:57,213
If I had received good
instruction as a child...

60
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,963
Can you point out the sheriff?

61
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:00,792
Him with the mustaches.

62
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:05,753
I would be with my wife and children today.
I do not know what is to become of them.

63
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:14,254
But I hope and pray that she will not slight
them and compel them to go into low company.

64
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,280
Well...

65
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:29,202
I killed the wrong man, is the
which of why I'm here.

66
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,439
Had I killed the man I meant to,
I don't believed I'd have been convicted.

67
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,155
I see men out there in that
crowd that's worse than me.

68
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,533
Okay.

69
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:47,261
Before I am hanged,
I would like to say...

70
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:00,734
Naw, we ain't arrested him.

71
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,755
Ain't caught up to him,
he lit out for the Territory.

72
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:08,482
I would think that he's throwed in with
Lucky Ned Pepper, whose gang robbed

73
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,842
a mail hack yesterday
on the Poteau River.

74
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:12,644
Well, why are you
not looking for him?

75
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:14,871
I have no authority
in the Indian Nation.

76
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:18,001
Tom Chaney is the business
of the U.S marshals now.

77
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,388
When will they arrest him?

78
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:22,465
Not soon, I'm afraid.
The marshals are not well-staffed.

79
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,478
And I'll tell you, frankly,

80
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:27,434
Chaney's at the end of a long
list of fugitives and malefactors.

81
00:06:27,843 --> 00:06:30,915
Could I hire a marshal
to pursue Tom Chaney?

82
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,819
You have a lot of experience
with bounty hunters, do you?

83
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,552
That is a silly question.
I am here to settle my father's affairs.

84
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:39,257
- All alone?
- Well I am the person for it.

85
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:42,256
Mama was never any good at sums,
and she could hardly spell 'cat'.

86
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:44,420
I intend to see
Papa's killer hanged.

87
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:48,820
Well, nothing prevents you from offering
a reward and so informing a marshal.

88
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:50,944
It'd have to be real money though,
to be persuasive.

89
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:53,322
Chaney's across the river,
in Choctaw Nation.

90
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:56,187
I will see to the money.
Who's the best marshal?

91
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:58,263
I'd have to weigh that.

92
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:00,674
William Waters is
the best tracker.

93
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:04,187
He's half Comanche, and it is
something to see him cut for sign.

94
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:06,957
The meanest is
Rooster Cogburn.

95
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:11,243
He's a pitiless man. Double tough.
Fear don't enter into his thinking.

96
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:13,608
Hmm, loves to pull a cork.

97
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,911
The best is probably L.T. Quinn.

98
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:19,518
He brings his prisoners in alive.

99
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,210
Now he may let one slip by,

100
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:26,513
now and again, but he believes that even the
worst of men is entitled to a fair shake.

101
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,031
Where can I find this Rooster?

102
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,961
The place is occupied.

103
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:35,573
I know it is occupied, Mr. Cogburn.
As I said, I have business with you.

104
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:38,136
I have prior business.

105
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:41,203
You've been at it for quite
some time, Mr. Cogburn.

106
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:43,376
There is no clock on my business.

107
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:46,572
The hell with you.
How did you stalk me here?

108
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:49,000
The sheriff told me
to look in the saloon.

109
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,062
The saloon then referred me here.
We must talk.

110
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:54,960
Women ain't allowed
in the saloon.

111
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:58,305
I was not there as a customer.
I am fourteen years old.

112
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:02,925
The place is occupied.

113
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:05,804
Will be for some time.

114
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:14,200
Good evening.

115
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:29,774
If you would like to sleep in a coffin,
I would be honored.

116
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:51,815
How much are you
paying for cotton?

117
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:56,897
Nine and a half for low and middlin',
and ten for ordinary.

118
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:59,339
We got most of ours out early,

119
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,524
and sold to the Woodson brothers
in Little Rock for eleven cents.

120
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:06,771
Then I suggest you take the balance
of it to the Woodson brothers.

121
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,250
I did take the
balance to Woodson.

122
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:13,076
We got ten and a half.

123
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:16,252
Why'd you come here
to tell me this?

124
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:18,360
I thought we might shop
around up here next year,

125
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:20,179
but I guess we're doing
alright in Little Rock.

126
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,549
I'm Mattie Ross.

127
00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:26,301
Daughter of Frank Ross.

128
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:30,038
Aw, tragic thing.

129
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:33,109
May I say, your
father impressed me

130
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,039
with his manly qualities. He was a close
trader, but he acted the gentleman.

131
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,344
I propose to sell those ponies
back to you that my father bought.

132
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,240
Well that I fear,
is out of the question.

133
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:46,207
I will see that they are shipped to
you at my earliest convenience.

134
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,219
We don't want the ponies now.
We don't need them.

135
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,568
Well, that hardly concerns me. Your father
bought the ponies and paid for them,

136
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:54,263
and there's the end of it.
I have the bill of sale.

137
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:58,335
And I want $300 for Papa's saddle
horse that was stolen from your stable.

138
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:03,210
You'll have to take that up with
the man who stole the horse.

139
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:05,173
Tom Chaney stole the horse
while it was in your care.

140
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:07,085
You are responsible.

141
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:09,528
Yeah, I admire your sand.

142
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:13,034
But I believe you'll find I'm
not liable for such claims.

143
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:14,351
You were the custodian.

144
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:15,490
If you were a bank
that were robbed,

145
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,905
you could not simply tell
your depositors to go hang.

146
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:22,397
I do not entertain hypotheticals.
The world as it is is vexing enough.

147
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,968
Secondly, your evaluation
of the horse is high

148
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:28,183
by about $200.
How old are you?

149
00:10:28,184 --> 00:10:30,276
If anything,
my price is low.

150
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:32,468
My Judy was a
fine racing mare.

151
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:35,794
I've seen her jump an eight-rail fence
with a heavy rider. I'm fourteen.

152
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:38,808
Oh, well, it's all
very interesting.

153
00:10:38,974 --> 00:10:41,684
The ponies are yours,
take them.

154
00:10:41,685 --> 00:10:44,366
Your father's horse was stolen
by a murderous criminal.

155
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:49,082
I had provided reasonable protection for
the creature as per our implicit agreement.

156
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:53,491
My watchman had his teeth knocked
out and can take only soup.

157
00:10:53,492 --> 00:10:54,959
I will take you to law.

158
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,450
You have no case.

159
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:58,978
Lawyer J. Noble Daggett of Dardanelle,
Arkansas may think otherwise.

160
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:03,565
As might a jury, petitioned by a
widow and three small children.

161
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:09,666
I will pay $200 to
your father's estate

162
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,163
when I have in my hand a
letter from your lawyer,

163
00:11:12,164 --> 00:11:16,289
absolving me of all liability from
the beginning of the world to date.

164
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,669
I'll take $200 for Judy,
plus one hundred for the ponies,

165
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,161
and $25 for the grey horse
that Tom Chaney left.

166
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:22,890
He was easily worth forty.

167
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,238
That is $325, total.

168
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:28,478
The ponies have no part in it.
I will not buy them.

169
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,851
Then the price for
Judy is $325.

170
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:34,922
I would not pay $325
for winged Pegasus.

171
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:37,980
As for the grey horse,
it does not belong to you.

172
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,940
The grey horse was lent to
Tom Chaney by my father.

173
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:42,229
Chaney only had
the use of him.

174
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:47,818
I will pay $225 and
keep the grey horse.

175
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:50,444
- I don't want the ponies.
- I can't accept that.

176
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:53,485
There will be no settlement after
I leave this office. It will go to law.

177
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:55,521
All right, this is my last offer.

178
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,331
$250. For that, I get the
release previously discussed

179
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:03,454
and I keep your father's saddle.

180
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,611
The grey horse is
not yours to sell.

181
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:07,694
The saddle is not for sale.
I will keep it.

182
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:09,993
Lawyer Daggett will prove the
ownership of the grey horse.

183
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:10,715
He will come after you with a

184
00:12:10,716 --> 00:12:12,290
- Writ of Replevin.
- A what?

185
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,513
- Writ of Replev...
- All right, now look.

186
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,197
Listen very carefully,

187
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:16,691
as I will not bargain further.

188
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:20,276
I will take the ponies back,
and the grey horse, which is mine,

189
00:12:20,277 --> 00:12:21,937
and settle...

190
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:26,406
for $300. Now you must
take that or leave it,

191
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:29,128
and I do not much
care which it is.

192
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:35,359
Well, Lawyer Dagget would not wish
me to consider anything under $325.

193
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,989
But I will settle for $320...

194
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,975
If I am given the
$20 in advance.

195
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:43,504
Now here's what I have
to say about that saddle.

196
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,754
Frank Ross's daughter...

197
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:55,737
Oh, my poor child...

198
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:58,700
Oh, my poor child...

199
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:03,210
Now are you going to be staying with us,
or are you hurrying back home to your mama?

200
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:05,529
I'll stay here if
you can have me.

201
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,869
I just spent last night
at the undertaker's,

202
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,024
in the company
of three corpses.

203
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,164
I felt like Ezekiel

204
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:14,079
in the valley of
the dry bones.

205
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,987
Well, God bless you.

206
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:20,054
Now you'll be rooming
with Grandma Turner.

207
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:25,109
We're having to double up, what with all the
people in town come to see the hanging.

208
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:29,604
This was in your
poor father's room.

209
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:31,714
That is everything.

210
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:34,590
There are no light
fingers in this house.

211
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:46,320
Now, if you need something
for to tote the gun around,

212
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:50,781
I can give you an empty
flour sack for a nickel.

213
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,926
What did you see
when you arrived?

214
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:35,885
A woman was out in the yard

215
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:38,667
dead with blow flies on her face.

216
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:44,494
An old man was inside with his breast blown
open by a scatter gun, and his feet burned.

217
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:48,401
He was still alive, but just was.
Said it was them two Wharton boys done it.

218
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:50,362
- Rode up, drunk.
- Objection.

219
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:51,640
Hearsay.

220
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,076
Dying declaration,
your honor.

221
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:56,259
Objection's overruled.
Proceed Mr. Cogburn.

222
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:01,549
Now them two Wharton boys, that'd be
Odus and C.C., throwed down on him,

223
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,885
asked him where his money was,
but he wouldn't tell them.

224
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:08,069
They lit pine knots and
held them to his feet.

225
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:11,602
He told them the money
was in the fruit jar.

226
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:14,687
Under a grey rock at the
corner of the smoke house.

227
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:16,197
And then?

228
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,829
Well, he died on us. Passed
away in considerable pain.

229
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,351
What'd you do then?

230
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:24,074
Me and Marshal Potter
went out to the smoke house.

231
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:28,212
And that rock had been moved.
The jar with the money in it was gone.

232
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:31,047
- Objection. Speculative.
- Sustained.

233
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:34,659
You found a flat grey rock in
the corner of the smoke house

234
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,974
with a hollowed out
space beneath it.

235
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:40,781
If the prosecutor is going to give
evidence, I suggest he be sworn.

236
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,772
Mr. Cogburn, what did you find, if anything,
in the corner of that smokehouse?

237
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:48,819
Found a flat grey rock with a hollowed
out space under it, nothing there.

238
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,934
- Then what did you...
- No jar or nothing.

239
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:52,386
And then what did you do?

240
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:57,076
Well, rode up to the Whartons near where
the North Fork strikes the Canadian...

241
00:15:57,077 --> 00:15:59,334
- What did you find?
- branch of the Canadian.

242
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:04,893
I had my glass, spotted them two
boys and their old daddy, Aaron,

243
00:16:04,894 --> 00:16:07,623
down the creek bank
with some hogs.

244
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:09,181
They'd killed a shoat

245
00:16:09,182 --> 00:16:12,254
Had a fire built up under a
wash pot for scalding water.

246
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:13,195
What did you do?

247
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:16,518
Announced we was U.S. marshals,
I hollered out to Aaron

248
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,442
I needed to talk
to his two boys.

249
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:21,468
He raised an ax,

250
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:24,289
commenced to cussing us and
blackguarding this court.

251
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,981
What did you do then?

252
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,657
I backed away from the ax,

253
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:30,895
tried to talked some
sense into him.

254
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:37,769
While this was going on, C.C. he edges over
to the wash pot there, behind the steam,

255
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,856
and picks up a shotgun.

256
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,097
Potter seen him,
but it was too late.

257
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:46,539
C.C. Wharton pulled out on
Potter with one barrel.

258
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,374
Turned to do the same
for me and I shot him.

259
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,106
And the old man raised
the ax, and I shot him.

260
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,366
Odus lit out,
and I shot him.

261
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:04,508
C.C. Wharton and Aaron Wharton
were dead when they hit the ground.

262
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,312
Odus was just winged.

263
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:09,209
Did you find the jar
with $120 in it?

264
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,800
- Leading.
- Sustained.

265
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:12,487
What happened then?

266
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:15,539
Found a jar with $120 in it.

267
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,154
What became of
Odus Wharton?

268
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:20,135
There he sits.

269
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:23,636
You may ask, Mr. Goudy.

270
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:25,850
Thank you, Mr. Barlow.

271
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:41,206
Mr. Cogburn,

272
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:44,303
in your four years
as a U.S. marshal,

273
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:46,528
how many men have you shot?

274
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:51,514
- Never shot nobody that didn't ask for it.
- Well that was not the question.

275
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,447
How many?

276
00:17:54,442 --> 00:17:55,535
Shot or killed?

277
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:59,801
Let us restrict it to killed, so that
we may have a manageable figure.

278
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:01,284
About twelve...

279
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:05,845
or fifteen. Stopping men in flight,
defending myself, et cetera.

280
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:07,608
Around twelve he says.

281
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,317
Or fifteen.

282
00:18:09,318 --> 00:18:13,039
So many, you cannot
keep a precise count.

283
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,814
I have examined the records
and can supply the accurate figure.

284
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:18,485
Oh...

285
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:22,800
I believe them two Wharton boys
makes it twenty-three.

286
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,913
And how many members
of this one family,

287
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:28,868
the Wharton family,
have you killed?

288
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:33,129
- Immediate, or...?
- Did you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother?

289
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,034
And Clete Wharton,
half brother?

290
00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:38,592
Well, Clete was selling ardent
spirits to the Cherokee.

291
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,146
He come at me
with a king bolt.

292
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:41,604
A king bolt?

293
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:46,457
You were armed, and
he advanced upon you

294
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,299
with nothing more
than a king bolt?

295
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,860
From a wagon tongue?

296
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:54,846
I've seen men badly torn up with nothing
bigger than a king bolt. I defended myself.

297
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,901
Returning to the other encounter,

298
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,609
with Aaron Wharton and
his two remaining sons.

299
00:19:00,863 --> 00:19:02,589
You sprang from cover

300
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,113
with revolver in hand.

301
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:06,013
- I did.
- Loaded and cocked.

302
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:09,107
Well if it ain't loaded
and cocked, it don't shoot.

303
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:14,172
And like his son, Aaron Wharton
advanced against an armed man.

304
00:19:14,173 --> 00:19:16,301
Well, he was armed.
He had an axe raised.

305
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:19,279
I believe you testified you backed
away from Aaron Wharton.

306
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,502
- That's right.
- Which direction were you going?

307
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:25,180
I always go backwards
when I'm backing up.

308
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:30,175
Very amusing.

309
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:33,402
Now he advanced on you much
in the manner of Clete Wharton.

310
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:38,484
Menacing you with that little ol' king bolt,
or rolled up newspaper, or whatever it was.

311
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:41,234
Yes, sir. He commenced
to cussing and

312
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:45,456
- laying about a threat.
- And you were backing away.

313
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:48,455
How many steps before
the shooting started?

314
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:52,608
Uh, seven to eight steps.

315
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,615
Good, and Wharton keeping pace,

316
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:57,458
advancing away
from his campfire.

317
00:19:57,459 --> 00:20:00,644
Seven, eight steps.

318
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:01,809
What would that be?

319
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,984
Fifteen, twenty feet?

320
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:05,540
I suppose.

321
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,744
Will you explain to
this jury, Mr. Cogburn,

322
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:13,884
why Mr. Wharton was found immediately
by his wash pot, one arm in the fire,

323
00:20:13,885 --> 00:20:16,034
his sleeve and hand smoldering?

324
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:17,599
Did you move the body
after you shot him?

325
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,914
Why would I do that?

326
00:20:18,915 --> 00:20:22,016
You did not drag the body over
to the fire and fling his arm in?

327
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:24,011
- No, sir.
- Two witnesses

328
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:27,007
who arrived on the scene will
testify to the location of the body.

329
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:30,009
You do not remember
moving the body.

330
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:36,283
So it was a cold blooded bushwhack, while
poor Mr. Wharton was tending his campfire.

331
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:37,839
Objection.

332
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,685
If that's where the body was,
I might have moved him.

333
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:42,384
I do not remember.

334
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:45,667
Why would you move
the body, Mr. Cogburn?

335
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:49,858
Them hogs were moving around.
They might have moved him.

336
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:52,727
I do not remember.

337
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:58,006
Son of a bitch.

338
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,666
- Mr. Cogburn.
- What is it?

339
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:00,798
I'd like to talk to you a minute.

340
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,643
What is it?

341
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:06,999
They tell me you're
a man with true grit.

342
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:10,556
What do you want, girl?

343
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:12,157
Speak up, it's suppertime.

344
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:13,931
Let me do that.

345
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:15,758
Your makings are too dry.

346
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:18,094
I'm looking for the man who shot
and killed my father, Frank Ross,

347
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:19,795
in front of the
Monarch Boarding House.

348
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:22,047
The man's name
is Tom Chaney.

349
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,635
They say he's over in Indian territory,
and I need someone to go after him.

350
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,051
What's your name, girl?

351
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:30,078
My name is Mattie Ross.

352
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,694
We're located in Yell County.

353
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:33,817
My mother is at home looking
after my sister, Victoria,

354
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,049
and my brother, little Frank.

355
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,222
Best go home to them.

356
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:39,056
They'll need help
with the churning.

357
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:40,513
There is a fugitive
warrant out for Chaney.

358
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:44,437
Government will pay you $2 for bringing
him in plus 10 cents a mile for each of you.

359
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,332
On top of that, I will
pay you a $50 reward.

360
00:21:48,878 --> 00:21:50,614
What are you?

361
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,621
What you got
there in your poke?

362
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:58,318
My god, a Colt Dragoon.

363
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,032
You're no bigger than a corn nubbin.
What are you doing with a pistol like that?

364
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,992
I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it.

365
00:22:03,993 --> 00:22:06,362
- Kill Tom Chaney?
- If the law fails to do so.

366
00:22:06,363 --> 00:22:08,295
Well that piece will
do the job for you,

367
00:22:08,296 --> 00:22:11,762
if you find a high stump to rest it on,
and a wall to put behind you.

368
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,040
Nobody here knew
my father and I'm

369
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,808
afraid nothing's going to be done
about Chaney, except I do it.

370
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:19,940
My brother is a child, and my mother
is indecisive and hobbled by grief.

371
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:23,224
I don't believe
you have $50.

372
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:24,606
I have a contract
with Colonel Stonehill,

373
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:26,838
which he will make payment
on tomorrow or the next day.

374
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:28,924
Once our lawyer countersigns.

375
00:22:31,462 --> 00:22:34,919
Don't believe in fairy tales or sermons
or stories about money, baby sister.

376
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,420
But thanks for the cigarette.

377
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:22,578
Isn't your mama
expecting you home, dear?

378
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:25,162
My business is not yet finished.

379
00:23:25,356 --> 00:23:28,051
Mrs. Floyd, have any
rooms opened up?

380
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:32,094
Grandma Turner's...
the bed is quite narrow.

381
00:23:32,095 --> 00:23:35,005
The second floor
back did open up.

382
00:23:35,006 --> 00:23:38,705
But uh, that gentleman on
the porch has just taken it.

383
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:41,487
Oh, but don't worry
yourself, dear.

384
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,597
You're not disturbing
Grandma Turner.

385
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:29,785
My name is LaBoeuf.

386
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:33,194
I just come from Yell County.

387
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:37,201
We have no rodeo
clowns in Yell County.

388
00:24:41,014 --> 00:24:44,180
A saucy line will not
get you far with me.

389
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:46,417
I saw your mother
yesterday morning.

390
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,730
She said for you to
come right on home.

391
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:50,729
What was your business there?

392
00:25:02,221 --> 00:25:04,353
This is a man I think you know.

393
00:25:06,598 --> 00:25:08,909
You called him
Tom Chaney, I believe

394
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,011
Though in the months I've been tracking him
he has used the name Theron Chelmsford.

395
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,459
John Todd Anderson,
and others.

396
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,796
He dallied in Monroe, Louisiana
and Pine Bluff, Arkansas

397
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:20,780
before turning up at
your father's place.

398
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:24,928
Then why did you not catch him at
Pine Bluff, Arkansas or Monroe, Louisiana?

399
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:27,359
He is a crafty one.

400
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,112
I thought him
slow witted myself.

401
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,259
That was his act.

402
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,779
It was a good one.

403
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,506
Are you some kind of law?

404
00:25:35,507 --> 00:25:37,007
That's right.

405
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,214
I'm a Texas Ranger.

406
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:45,734
That may make you a
big noise in that state.

407
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:48,649
In Arkansas you should mind that
your Texas trappings and title

408
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,654
do not make you an object of fun.

409
00:25:50,655 --> 00:25:54,638
Why have you been
ineffectually pursuing Chaney?

410
00:25:55,634 --> 00:25:59,369
He shot and killed a state senator
named Bibbs in Waco, Texas.

411
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,314
Bibbs' family put out a reward.

412
00:26:01,315 --> 00:26:03,533
And how came Chaney to
shoot a state senator?

413
00:26:03,534 --> 00:26:05,838
My understanding is there
was an argument about a dog.

414
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,105
You know anything about the
whereabouts of Chaney?

415
00:26:08,106 --> 00:26:11,490
Well he's in the territory, and I hold out
little hope for you winning your bounty.

416
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:13,697
- Why is that?
- My man will beat you to it.

417
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:16,496
I've hired a deputy marshal.
The toughest one they have.

418
00:26:16,497 --> 00:26:20,865
And he's familiar with the Lucky Ned Pepper
gang they say Chaney's tied up with.

419
00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:23,573
Well, I will throw in with
you and your marshal.

420
00:26:23,574 --> 00:26:27,849
- No, Marshal Cogburn and I are fine.
- It'll be to our mutual advantage.

421
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,531
Your marshal, I presume,
knows the territory.

422
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:34,042
I know Chaney. It's at least a
two-man job to take him in alive.

423
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:37,464
When Chaney is taken, he's coming
back to Fort Smith to hang.

424
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:40,641
I'm not having him go to Texas
to hang for shooting some senator.

425
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,207
It is not important
where he hangs, is it?

426
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,208
It is to me.

427
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:45,528
Is it to you?

428
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:46,946
It means a great deal
of money to me.

429
00:26:46,947 --> 00:26:49,540
It's been many months' work.

430
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,336
Oh, I'm sorry that you're paid
piecework and not on wages.

431
00:26:52,337 --> 00:26:56,301
And that you have been eluded
the winter long by a half-wit.

432
00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:01,317
You give out very little sugar
with your pronouncements.

433
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:04,998
When I sat there watching you,
I gave some thought to stealing a kiss,

434
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,584
though you are very young and sick,
and unattractive to boot.

435
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:12,010
But now I have a mind to give you
five or six good licks with my belt.

436
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:16,226
One would be as
unpleasant as the other.

437
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:20,101
If you wet your comb,
you might tame that cowlick.

438
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:24,254
Madame, I wish you would
leave these matters

439
00:27:24,255 --> 00:27:26,060
entirely to me,
or at the very least,

440
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,938
do me the courtesy of consulting me
before entering such agreements.

441
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:33,635
I am not scolding you, but I am
saying your headstrong ways

442
00:27:33,636 --> 00:27:36,463
will lead you into a
tight corner one day.

443
00:27:36,464 --> 00:27:38,263
I trust the enclosed document

444
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:41,815
will let you conclude your business
and return to Yell County.

445
00:27:42,153 --> 00:27:44,519
Yours, J. Noble Daggett.

446
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,952
I was as bad yesterday
as you look today.

447
00:27:46,953 --> 00:27:50,100
I was forced to share a
bed with Grandma Turner.

448
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:53,160
I'm not acquainted
with Grandma Turner.

449
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:58,526
She is a resident of the city. It does
not surprise me that she carries disease.

450
00:28:00,364 --> 00:28:03,120
This malarial place has
ruined my health,

451
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:05,468
as it has my finances.

452
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:07,223
I owe you money.

453
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:08,602
You have not traded poorly.

454
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,747
Oh, certainly not.

455
00:28:11,263 --> 00:28:14,623
I'm paying you for a
horse I do not possess,

456
00:28:14,624 --> 00:28:17,717
and I bought back a
string of useless ponies

457
00:28:17,718 --> 00:28:19,747
which I cannot sell again.

458
00:28:19,748 --> 00:28:21,976
You're forgetting
the grey horse.

459
00:28:21,977 --> 00:28:22,802
Crow bait.

460
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,661
You are looking at the
thing in the wrong light.

461
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:28,631
I am looking at it in the light
of God's eternal truth.

462
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:31,360
Your illness is putting you down
in the dumps.

463
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,267
You will soon find another
buyer for the ponies.

464
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:37,035
Well I have a tentative
offer of $10 per head

465
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,871
From the "Pfitzer Soap
Works" of Little Rock

466
00:28:39,872 --> 00:28:42,848
It would be a shame to destroy
such spirited horse flesh.

467
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:46,876
So it would. I'm confident
the deal will fall through.

468
00:28:47,756 --> 00:28:52,004
Look here, I need a pony and I
will pay $10 for one of them.

469
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:54,459
No, that's a lot price.
No, no, it...

470
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,007
Wait a minute.

471
00:28:56,471 --> 00:28:58,557
Are we trading again?

472
00:29:00,597 --> 00:29:02,354
This one is beautiful.

473
00:29:20,331 --> 00:29:22,016
He don't know
he got a rider.

474
00:29:22,017 --> 00:29:24,773
You're too light.

475
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:29,884
He thinks he's got
a horsefly on him.

476
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:31,450
He's very spirited.

477
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:33,250
I'll call him "Little Blackie".

478
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:35,337
That's a good name.

479
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:39,208
What does he
like for a treat?

480
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,894
Well, ma'am, he's a horse.

481
00:29:41,895 --> 00:29:44,087
So he likes apples.

482
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,039
Thank Mr. Stonehill for me.

483
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,229
No, ma'am, I ain't supposed
to utter your name.

484
00:29:53,098 --> 00:29:54,955
See, sleep.

485
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:58,700
That is fine.
I will wake him.

486
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:01,455
Marshal Cogburn.

487
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:04,320
It is I, Mattie Ross,
your employer.

488
00:30:05,361 --> 00:30:07,350
How long 'till you're
ready to go?

489
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:08,158
Go where?

490
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,402
To the Indian Territory
to pursue Tom Chaney.

491
00:30:11,835 --> 00:30:16,156
Oh, you're the grieved girl
with stories of El Dorado.

492
00:30:17,044 --> 00:30:19,579
Huh. How much
money you got there?

493
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,265
I said $50 to achieve Chaney.
You did not believe me?

494
00:30:23,524 --> 00:30:25,805
I did not know.

495
00:30:26,143 --> 00:30:27,694
You're a hard one to figure.

496
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,905
How long for you to
make ready to depart?

497
00:30:29,906 --> 00:30:32,625
Well, hold on, sis.

498
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:37,246
Though I remember your offer,
I do not remember agreeing to it.

499
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:40,710
If I'm to go up against Ned Pepper,

500
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:45,180
I'll need $100.
That much I can tell you. $100.

501
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:50,304
To retrieve your man, $100.

502
00:30:50,895 --> 00:30:56,741
I will take that $50 in advance.
It'll be for expenses.

503
00:30:56,742 --> 00:30:58,532
You are trying to
take advantage of me.

504
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:00,563
I am giving you
the children's rate.

505
00:31:00,564 --> 00:31:02,051
I'm not a sharper.

506
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,387
I'm an old man sleeping in a rope bed
in a room behind a Chinese grocery.

507
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:09,911
- I have nothing.
- You want to be kept in whiskey.

508
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:11,663
I don't need to buy that.

509
00:31:11,664 --> 00:31:12,978
I'd confiscate it.

510
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:14,928
I'm an officer of the court.

511
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:16,626
Ah, thank you.

512
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:19,166
$100. That's the rate.

513
00:31:19,234 --> 00:31:20,463
Then I shall not niggle.

514
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,829
Can we depart this afternoon?

515
00:31:22,993 --> 00:31:24,771
We?

516
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,823
You're not going.
That ain't no part of it.

517
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:31,150
You have misjudged me if you think
I'm silly enough to give you $50

518
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:32,495
and watch you simply ride off.

519
00:31:33,027 --> 00:31:34,672
I am a bonded U.S. marshal.

520
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:35,864
That weighs but little with me.

521
00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:37,074
I will see the thing done.

522
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:40,510
Damn ducks. Can't go
after Ned Pepper.

523
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:43,687
Man's a hard man, and to look
after a baby at the same time...

524
00:31:43,688 --> 00:31:44,848
I am not a baby.

525
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:46,338
Won't be stopping
at boarding houses,

526
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:48,980
where there's a warm bed
and hot grub on the table.

527
00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:51,527
I'll be grabbing a
saddle. Eating light.

528
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:54,533
When the sleeping is done,
it'll take place on the ground.

529
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,804
Well I have slept
out at night before.

530
00:31:56,805 --> 00:32:00,479
Papa took me and little Frank 'coon
hunting last summer on the Petit Jean.

531
00:32:01,216 --> 00:32:02,569
We were in the woods all night.

532
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,046
We sat around a big fire
and told ghost stories.

533
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:07,024
We had a good time.

534
00:32:07,923 --> 00:32:09,251
'Coon hunting?

535
00:32:09,252 --> 00:32:11,742
This ain't no 'coon hunt.

536
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,629
It is the same idea
as a 'coon hunt.

537
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,076
Don't come within forty
miles of being a coon hunt.

538
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:16,965
You are just trying to make your
work sound harder than it is.

539
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:18,331
Here's the money.

540
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:19,822
Now I aim to get Tom Chaney,

541
00:32:19,823 --> 00:32:22,323
and if you are not game, I will
find somebody who is game.

542
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:23,775
All I've heard out of
you so far is talk.

543
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,199
I know you can drink whiskey,

544
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,906
and snore and spit and wallow in
filth and bemoan your station.

545
00:32:27,956 --> 00:32:29,464
The rest has been braggadocio.

546
00:32:29,465 --> 00:32:32,198
They told me you had grit
and that is why I came to you.

547
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,467
I'm not paying for talk.

548
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:36,059
I can get all the talk I need and
more at the Monarch Boarding House.

549
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,384
Leave your money.

550
00:32:42,385 --> 00:32:47,239
Meet me here at 7:00 tomorrow morning
and we can begin our 'coon hunt.

551
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:57,304
Dearest Mother,

552
00:32:58,482 --> 00:33:01,114
I am about to embark
on a great adventure.

553
00:33:02,194 --> 00:33:04,402
I have learned that Tom
Chaney has fled into the wild.

554
00:33:04,403 --> 00:33:07,238
And I shall assist the
authorities in pursuit.

555
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:09,865
You know that Papa would
want me to be firm in the right,

556
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:11,755
as he always was.

557
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:15,085
So do not fear on my account.

558
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:17,435
Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

559
00:33:17,436 --> 00:33:19,539
I shall fear no evil.

560
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:24,158
The author of all things watches
over me, and I have a fine horse.

561
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:27,213
Kiss little Frankie for me,
and pinch Violet's cheek.

562
00:33:27,453 --> 00:33:29,972
Their Papa's death
will soon be avenged.

563
00:33:32,527 --> 00:33:34,899
I am off for the
Choctaw Nation.

564
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:43,124
Where's Marshal Cogburn?

565
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,645
Went away.

566
00:33:44,646 --> 00:33:46,514
Left this.

567
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,416
Here inside is a train
ticket for your return home.

568
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:54,369
Use it.

569
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:58,596
By the time you read this, I will be
across the river in the Indian Nation.

570
00:33:58,597 --> 00:34:00,432
Pursuit would be futile.

571
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:02,707
I will return with
your man, Chaney.

572
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,571
Leave me to my work.

573
00:34:04,572 --> 00:34:06,709
Reuben Cogburn.

574
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:15,828
Is that Marshal Cogburn?

575
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:17,209
That is the man.

576
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,723
Who's he with?

577
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:20,099
I do not know.

578
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,816
Well take me across.

579
00:34:22,037 --> 00:34:23,976
So you're the runaway.

580
00:34:23,977 --> 00:34:27,154
Marshal told me you'd show up.
I'm to present you to the Sheriff.

581
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:30,803
That is a story. Let go of my horse.
I have business across the river.

582
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:35,929
If you don't turn around and take me
across, you may find yourself in court,

583
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,408
where you don't want to be.

584
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,219
I have a good lawyer.

585
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:48,653
Hey!

586
00:34:50,164 --> 00:34:51,252
Go, Little Blackie.

587
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:52,758
Come on.

588
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:07,026
That is quite a horse.

589
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,292
I will give you $10 for him.

590
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:10,752
From the money
you stole from me?

591
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,202
It was not stolen.
I'm out for your man.

592
00:36:13,203 --> 00:36:15,025
I was to accompany you.

593
00:36:15,026 --> 00:36:17,630
If I do not, there is no agreement
and my money was stolen.

594
00:36:17,631 --> 00:36:19,784
Why don't you put this
child back on the ferry.

595
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:22,156
It's a long road and time's a' wasting.

596
00:36:22,157 --> 00:36:25,169
If I go back, it's to the office of the U.S.
marshals to report the theft of my money.

597
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,018
And "fudel", Marshal Cogburn?
Pursuit would be "fudel"?

598
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,952
It's not spelled F-U-D-E-L.

599
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:44,293
It's time for your spanking.

600
00:36:44,294 --> 00:36:47,964
Now you will do as
the grown-ups say,

601
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:52,124
or I will get myself a birch
switch and stripe your leg.

602
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:57,525
Are you going to let
him do this, Marshal?

603
00:37:01,015 --> 00:37:05,271
No, I don't believe I will.
Put your switch away, LaBoeuf.

604
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:07,284
I aim to finish what I started.

605
00:37:07,285 --> 00:37:09,501
That'll be the biggest
mistake you ever made,

606
00:37:09,502 --> 00:37:11,783
you Texas brush-popper.

607
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,606
Hoorawed by a little girl.

608
00:37:40,055 --> 00:37:42,926
I am not accustomed
to so large a fire.

609
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:49,394
In Texas, we make do with
a fire little more than twigs.

610
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:52,287
Buffalo chips.

611
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:54,457
Heat the night's
ration of beans.

612
00:37:54,974 --> 00:38:00,001
And it is Ranger policy never to make your
camp in the same place as your cook fire.

613
00:38:00,266 --> 00:38:03,949
Very imprudent to make your
presence known in unsettled country.

614
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:13,683
How do you know Bagby
will have intelligence?

615
00:38:13,684 --> 00:38:15,275
He has a store.

616
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:18,053
That makes him an authority
on movements in the Territory?

617
00:38:18,054 --> 00:38:20,439
We have entered a wild place,

618
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,098
and anyone coming in

619
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,570
wanting any kind of supply

620
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:27,191
cannot pick and
choose his portal.

621
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:30,361
That is a piece of foolishness.

622
00:38:30,362 --> 00:38:32,711
All the snakes are
asleep this time of year.

623
00:38:32,712 --> 00:38:34,334
They have been
known to wake up.

624
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:35,522
Well let me have a rope, too.

625
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,949
A snake would not bother you.

626
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:40,386
You are too little and bony.

627
00:38:40,749 --> 00:38:43,665
You should fetch water for
the morning. Put it by the fire.

628
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:46,672
- The creek will ice over tonight.
- I'm not going down there again.

629
00:38:46,673 --> 00:38:48,527
If you want any more water,
you can fetch it yourself.

630
00:38:48,528 --> 00:38:52,086
You're lucky to be traveling in a
place where a spring is so handy.

631
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:56,256
In my country, you could ride for
days and see no ground water.

632
00:38:56,331 --> 00:38:59,330
I have lapped filthy
water from a hoof-print

633
00:38:59,365 --> 00:39:01,002
and was glad to have it.

634
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:03,919
If I ever meet one
of you Texas boys

635
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,659
who says he has never drank
water out of a horse-track,

636
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,533
I think I'd shake his hand and
give him a Daniel Webster cigar.

637
00:39:09,534 --> 00:39:10,569
You do not believe it?

638
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,277
Oh, I believed it the
first 25 times I heard it.

639
00:39:14,278 --> 00:39:17,611
Maybe... maybe it is true.

640
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:21,081
Maybe lapping water off
the ground is Ranger policy.

641
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:23,864
You're getting ready to show
your ignorance now, Cogburn.

642
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:26,585
I don't mind a little
personal chaffing.

643
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:30,432
But I won't hear anything against the
Ranger troop from a man like you.

644
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:36,394
How long you boys been
mounted on sheep down there?

645
00:39:36,395 --> 00:39:38,323
My white Appaloosa
will still be galloping

646
00:39:38,324 --> 00:39:41,041
when that big American stud of
yours is winded and collapsed.

647
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:42,817
Now make another joke about it.

648
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:45,470
You're only trying to put on
a show for this girl, Mattie,

649
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:48,113
with what you must
think is a keen tongue.

650
00:39:48,114 --> 00:39:50,171
This is like women talking.

651
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:51,334
Yes, that is the way.

652
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:54,380
Make me out foolish
in this girl's eyes.

653
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:57,322
I think she has you
pretty well figured.

654
00:40:04,572 --> 00:40:07,506
Would you two like to hear the
story of the Midnight Caller?

655
00:40:08,997 --> 00:40:10,610
One of you is gonna
have to be the caller,

656
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:12,601
and I will tell you what to say.

657
00:40:12,603 --> 00:40:15,045
And I will do all the
other parts myself.

658
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:41,344
- Good morning, Marshal.
- Morning.

659
00:40:41,392 --> 00:40:43,066
Where's Mr. LaBoeuf?

660
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:46,080
Down by the creek
performing his necessaries.

661
00:40:46,398 --> 00:40:50,071
Well, Marshal Cogburn, I welcome
the chance for a private parley.

662
00:40:50,258 --> 00:40:53,312
I gather that you and
Mr. LaBoeuf have come to some...

663
00:40:53,313 --> 00:40:54,520
some sort of agreement.

664
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:57,619
And as your employer, I believe I
have the right to know the particulars.

665
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,120
The particulars

666
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,758
is that we'll bring Chaney
down to the magistrate,

667
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:07,081
in San Saba, Texas, where they have a
considerable reward on him, which we split.

668
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:09,688
I did not want him
brought to Texas

669
00:41:09,689 --> 00:41:12,920
to have a Texas punishment
administered for a Texas crime.

670
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:14,709
That was not our agreement.

671
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,529
What you want is to have
him caught and punished.

672
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:20,354
I want him to know he's being
punished for killing my father.

673
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:23,563
Well, you can let him know that.
You can tell him to his face.

674
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,360
You can spit on him,

675
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:28,489
make him eat sand out on
the road. I will hold him down.

676
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,054
Or if you want,

677
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:32,736
I'll flay the flesh off
the soles of his feet.

678
00:41:32,737 --> 00:41:35,323
Find you Indian pepper
you can rub in his wound.

679
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:37,266
Isn't that a $100 value?

680
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:39,108
No, it is not.

681
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:42,024
When I have bought and paid
for something, I will have my way.

682
00:41:42,025 --> 00:41:44,540
Why do you think I'm paying
you if not to have my way?

683
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,024
It's time for you to learn.

684
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:47,587
You cannot have your way

685
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,249
in every little particular.

686
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,116
If you find I failed to
satisfy your terms,

687
00:41:52,117 --> 00:41:55,282
I'll return your money at
the end of this expedition.

688
00:41:55,283 --> 00:41:58,520
Little Blackie and I are riding back to
the U.S. marshal's office. This is fraud.

689
00:41:58,521 --> 00:41:59,529
God damn it.

690
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,869
What's going on?

691
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,930
This is a business conversation.

692
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:04,010
Is that what you call it?

693
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:06,776
Sounds to me you're still being
hoorawed by a little girl.

694
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:08,803
- You say, hoorawed?
- That was the word.

695
00:42:08,804 --> 00:42:11,195
There is no hoorawing in it.
My agreement with the Marshal

696
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,912
ante-dates yours.
It has the force of law.

697
00:42:12,913 --> 00:42:14,586
The force of law?

698
00:42:14,587 --> 00:42:16,996
This man is a
notorious thumper.

699
00:42:16,997 --> 00:42:19,559
He rode by the light of
the moon with Quantrill.

700
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,072
- And Bloody Bill Anderson.
- Them men were patriots, Texas trash!

701
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,937
They murdered women and
children in Lawrence, Kansas.

702
00:42:24,938 --> 00:42:27,125
That's a God damn lie!

703
00:42:27,424 --> 00:42:29,233
What army was you in, Mister?

704
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:30,339
I was at Shreveport.

705
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,865
- First with Kirby Smith, then with...
- Yeah? What side was you on?

706
00:42:33,866 --> 00:42:36,045
I was in the army of
Northern Virginia, Cogburn.

707
00:42:36,046 --> 00:42:37,984
And I don't have to hang
my head when I say it.

708
00:42:37,985 --> 00:42:40,051
If you had served with
Captain Quantrill...

709
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:43,159
Captain! Captain Quantrill?

710
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:44,624
Indeed!

711
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:47,246
- Just let this go, LaBoeuf.
- Captain of what?

712
00:42:51,214 --> 00:42:52,325
We're done.

713
00:42:52,326 --> 00:42:54,663
There's not sufficient dollars
in the state of Texas

714
00:42:54,664 --> 00:42:57,255
to make it worth my while to
listen to your opinion.

715
00:42:57,256 --> 00:42:58,727
Our agreement is nullified.

716
00:42:58,728 --> 00:43:00,240
That suits me.

717
00:43:00,364 --> 00:43:01,861
It's each man for himself.

718
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:04,007
Congratulations, Cogburn.

719
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,427
You've graduated from
marauder to wet nurse.

720
00:43:09,399 --> 00:43:11,479
Adios.

721
00:43:16,926 --> 00:43:19,916
We don't need him,
do we, Marshal?

722
00:43:21,946 --> 00:43:24,433
We'd miss his Sharps carbine,

723
00:43:24,731 --> 00:43:27,403
It's apt to get lively out here.

724
00:43:49,718 --> 00:43:51,218
Hey!

725
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:55,007
Go on.

726
00:44:02,002 --> 00:44:03,564
You stay here, sister.

727
00:44:03,565 --> 00:44:05,703
I will see Bagby.

728
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:28,924
Has Chaney been here?

729
00:44:28,925 --> 00:44:30,121
No.

730
00:44:30,122 --> 00:44:32,513
Coke Hays was,
two days ago.

731
00:44:32,514 --> 00:44:34,323
Coke rides with Lucky Ned.

732
00:44:34,324 --> 00:44:36,446
Bought supplies with this.

733
00:44:39,497 --> 00:44:41,302
Well, this is Papa's gold piece.

734
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,104
Tom Chaney,
here we come.

735
00:44:43,105 --> 00:44:46,010
Not the world's only
California gold piece.

736
00:44:46,011 --> 00:44:47,445
They are rare here.

737
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:49,136
They are rare.

738
00:44:49,243 --> 00:44:50,978
But if it is Chaney's,

739
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,406
just as easily mean that
Lucky Ned and his gang

740
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:56,289
fell upon him as that
he fell in with them.

741
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,454
Chaney could be a corpse.

742
00:44:58,455 --> 00:45:01,203
That would be a bitter disappointment,
Marshal. What do we do?

743
00:45:01,204 --> 00:45:02,959
Pursue them.

744
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,699
Ned's unfinished business
for the marshals anyhow.

745
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,754
When we have him,
we'll also have Chaney.

746
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:09,994
Or learn the whereabouts of his body.

747
00:45:09,995 --> 00:45:12,227
Bagby didn't know
which way they went,

748
00:45:12,228 --> 00:45:14,020
but now that we know
they come through here,

749
00:45:14,021 --> 00:45:16,274
they couldn't be going
but one of two ways.

750
00:45:16,275 --> 00:45:19,446
Heading north towards
the Winding Stair Mountains,

751
00:45:19,447 --> 00:45:21,499
or pushing further west.

752
00:45:22,181 --> 00:45:24,484
I expect north.
More to rob.

753
00:45:24,534 --> 00:45:25,874
I found an eating place.

754
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,405
Called the Green Frog.

755
00:45:27,406 --> 00:45:29,893
Started calling myself Burroughs.

756
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,140
But my drinking picked up.

757
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:35,878
My wife did not care for the
company of my river friends.

758
00:45:35,879 --> 00:45:38,731
She decided to go back
to her first husband.

759
00:45:38,732 --> 00:45:41,285
He was a clerk in
a hardware store.

760
00:45:41,669 --> 00:45:44,764
She said, "Goodbye, Reuben."

761
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:47,859
"Love of decency does
not abide in you."

762
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,771
A divorced woman
talking about decency.

763
00:45:51,772 --> 00:45:54,317
I told her, "Goodbye, Nola."

764
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,717
"Hope that little nail-selling bastard
keeps you happy this time."

765
00:45:57,718 --> 00:46:00,825
She took my boy with her too.

766
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:04,313
He never cared for me anyway.

767
00:46:05,071 --> 00:46:08,134
I guess I did speak
awful rough to him.

768
00:46:08,606 --> 00:46:11,032
I did not mean anything by it.

769
00:46:11,382 --> 00:46:14,713
You would not want to see
a clumsier child than Horace.

770
00:46:16,164 --> 00:46:18,944
I bet he broke forty cups.

771
00:46:47,142 --> 00:46:48,973
Is it Chaney?

772
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:51,982
I would not recognize
the soles of his feet.

773
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:55,820
Well, you'll have to
clamber up and look.

774
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,280
I'm too old and too fat.

775
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,717
Now the Green Frog
had one billiard table.

776
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:05,652
Served ladies and
men both. Mostly men.

777
00:47:05,653 --> 00:47:07,823
Tried running it myself for a while,

778
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:10,211
but couldn't keep good help.

779
00:47:10,212 --> 00:47:13,001
I never did learn
how to buy meat.

780
00:47:13,683 --> 00:47:15,352
That him?

781
00:47:15,757 --> 00:47:16,859
I believe not.

782
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,897
Well, cut him down.

783
00:47:18,898 --> 00:47:20,433
Why?

784
00:47:20,434 --> 00:47:22,134
I might know him.

785
00:47:25,487 --> 00:47:28,591
That's when I went out
to the state plains of Texas.

786
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:33,538
Shooting buffalo with Vernon Shaftoe
and a Flathead Indian named Ollie.

787
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:37,684
Now the Mormons had run
Shaftoe out of Great Salt Lake City.

788
00:47:37,685 --> 00:47:39,144
Don't ask me what for.

789
00:47:39,145 --> 00:47:42,114
All a misunderstanding.
Leave it go at that.

790
00:47:44,257 --> 00:47:47,334
Well, the big shaggies...

791
00:47:47,335 --> 00:47:48,983
About all gone now.

792
00:47:48,984 --> 00:47:50,502
Damn shame.

793
00:47:51,439 --> 00:47:55,426
I'd give $3 right now for
a pickled buffalo tongue.

794
00:47:58,181 --> 00:48:00,055
Why did they hang him so high?

795
00:48:00,056 --> 00:48:02,223
I do not know.

796
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:05,559
Must play in the belief
it'd make him more dead.

797
00:48:18,914 --> 00:48:21,183
I do not know this man.

798
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:53,761
You hanged him?

799
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:02,299
Why is he taking the hanged man?

800
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,809
Did he know him?

801
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,815
He did not.

802
00:49:06,342 --> 00:49:08,258
But it is a dead body.

803
00:49:08,259 --> 00:49:11,046
Must be worth something in the trade.

804
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,370
Now my second wife, Edna.

805
00:49:13,371 --> 00:49:16,171
She got the notion she
wanted me to be a lawyer.

806
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:19,672
Bought this heavy book called
"Daniels on Negotiable Instruments".

807
00:49:19,673 --> 00:49:21,366
Set me to reading it.

808
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:24,599
Never could get a grip on it.

809
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,314
I was happy enough to set
it aside and leave Texas.

810
00:49:28,726 --> 00:49:31,461
There ain't six trees
between here and Canada.

811
00:49:31,462 --> 00:49:33,676
Nothing else grows but
that has stickers on it.

812
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:36,312
Ask one of the...

813
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:40,651
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

814
00:49:40,652 --> 00:49:42,427
We's being followed.

815
00:49:42,831 --> 00:49:47,020
I asked that injun to signal with
a shot if someone was on our trail.

816
00:49:48,379 --> 00:49:50,112
Should we be concerned, Marshal?

817
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:54,213
Naw, Mr. LaBoeuf is
using us as a bird dog,

818
00:49:54,214 --> 00:49:57,269
in hopes of cutting in once
we've flushed the prey.

819
00:49:57,781 --> 00:50:02,760
Perhaps we could double back over our tracks
and confuse the trail in a clever way.

820
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:06,077
No, we will wait right here.

821
00:50:06,738 --> 00:50:09,118
Offer our friend a warm hello.

822
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,536
Ask him where he's going.

823
00:51:06,937 --> 00:51:08,935
You are not LaBoeuf.

824
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,973
My name is Forrester.

825
00:51:13,227 --> 00:51:17,115
I practice dentistry in the Nation.

826
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:21,160
Also veterinary arts and medicine

827
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:25,334
on those humans that
will sit still for it.

828
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:28,688
You have your work
cut out for you there.

829
00:51:30,196 --> 00:51:35,936
Traded for him with an Indian who
said he came by him honestly.

830
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:41,662
I gave up two dental mirrors
and a bottle of expectorant.

831
00:51:43,505 --> 00:51:47,504
Do either of you need
medical attention?

832
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:51,913
No. Say, it is fixing
to get cold.

833
00:51:51,914 --> 00:51:54,606
You know of anywhere
to take shelter?

834
00:51:54,607 --> 00:51:57,396
I have my bear skin.

835
00:52:01,848 --> 00:52:06,505
You might want to head over
to the Original Greaser Bob's.

836
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:12,410
He notched a dugout into a
hollow along the Carrillon River.

837
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:15,462
If you ride the river,

838
00:52:15,463 --> 00:52:17,542
you won't fail to see it.

839
00:52:17,543 --> 00:52:22,006
Greaser Bob, the
original Greaser Bob,

840
00:52:22,007 --> 00:52:25,280
is hunting north of the picket wire

841
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:29,296
and would not begrudge its use.

842
00:52:29,423 --> 00:52:33,572
- Much obliged.
- Now, I have taken his teeth.

843
00:52:34,206 --> 00:52:37,090
I will entertain an offer

844
00:52:37,091 --> 00:52:39,289
for the rest of him.

845
00:52:47,383 --> 00:52:49,374
Take my jacket.

846
00:52:50,316 --> 00:52:52,470
Creep up onto the roof.

847
00:52:53,632 --> 00:52:57,285
If they're unfriendly, I'll give
you a sign to damp the chimney.

848
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:23,666
Who's out there?

849
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,805
We're looking for shelter.

850
00:53:26,111 --> 00:53:29,698
No room for
you here. Ride on.

851
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:33,859
- Who's in there?
- Ride on.

852
00:54:14,134 --> 00:54:15,685
I'm a federal officer.

853
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:16,892
Who's in there?

854
00:54:16,893 --> 00:54:19,908
A Methodist and
a son of a bitch.

855
00:54:19,909 --> 00:54:22,093
This is Rooster Cogburn.

856
00:54:22,108 --> 00:54:26,126
Columbus Potter and five other
marshals is out here with me.

857
00:54:26,127 --> 00:54:28,348
We got a bucket of coal oil.

858
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:31,067
In one minute we will burn
your house from both ends.

859
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:32,853
There's only two of you.

860
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:35,237
Go ahead and bet
your life on it.

861
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:36,999
How many of you is in there?

862
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,218
Just the two of us.

863
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:39,684
But my partner's hit

864
00:54:39,685 --> 00:54:41,249
and he can't walk.

865
00:54:42,455 --> 00:54:44,634
Is that Emmet Quincy?

866
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,415
You said it was a
man on the roof.

867
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:07,222
I thought it was Potter.

868
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:11,119
You was always dumb Quincy,
and remain true to form.

869
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,899
This here's an awful lot of sofky.

870
00:55:14,866 --> 00:55:16,814
You boys looking for company?

871
00:55:17,128 --> 00:55:19,809
That was our supper
and breakfast both.

872
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,908
I like a big breakfast.

873
00:55:22,577 --> 00:55:25,634
Sofky always cooks up
bigger than you think.

874
00:55:25,635 --> 00:55:28,699
Hmm. Good store of
whiskey here, as well.

875
00:55:29,215 --> 00:55:32,034
What are you boys up to,
outside of cooking banquets?

876
00:55:32,035 --> 00:55:33,509
Just having our supper.

877
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:36,534
You don't know who's
outside in weather like this.

878
00:55:36,535 --> 00:55:38,143
Might have been some crazy man.

879
00:55:38,144 --> 00:55:40,217
Anyone can say that
he is a marshal.

880
00:55:40,218 --> 00:55:41,323
My leg hurts.

881
00:55:41,324 --> 00:55:43,757
I'll bet it does.

882
00:55:48,341 --> 00:55:51,962
When was the last time you see
your old pard, Ned Pepper?

883
00:55:52,226 --> 00:55:54,700
I do not know him.
Who is he?

884
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:57,160
I'm surprised you
don't remember him.

885
00:55:57,161 --> 00:56:01,306
Skinny fellow, nervous and
quick, his lips all messed up.

886
00:56:01,596 --> 00:56:03,621
That don't bring anybody to mind.

887
00:56:03,622 --> 00:56:05,520
There's a new boy

888
00:56:06,205 --> 00:56:08,334
that might be running with Ned.

889
00:56:08,335 --> 00:56:12,108
He's got a powder mark
on his face, black flash.

890
00:56:12,109 --> 00:56:13,757
Calls himself Chaney.

891
00:56:13,758 --> 00:56:16,234
Or Chelmsford, sometimes.

892
00:56:16,397 --> 00:56:18,185
Carries a Henry rifle.

893
00:56:18,186 --> 00:56:20,404
That don't bring anybody to mind.

894
00:56:20,405 --> 00:56:23,225
Black mark, I would
remember that.

895
00:56:23,351 --> 00:56:26,367
You don't remember nothing
no more now, do you Quincy?

896
00:56:27,479 --> 00:56:28,902
What do you know, Moon?

897
00:56:28,903 --> 00:56:31,168
He don't know those
boys you're looking for.

898
00:56:31,169 --> 00:56:33,878
I don't know those boys.

899
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:36,945
I always try to
help out the law.

900
00:56:36,946 --> 00:56:39,111
By the time I get
to Fort Smith,

901
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:42,885
that leg will be swelled up
tight as Dick's hat band.

902
00:56:42,886 --> 00:56:44,390
It'll be mortified.

903
00:56:44,391 --> 00:56:46,217
They will cut it off.

904
00:56:46,218 --> 00:56:49,444
And then, if you live, I'll get you two
or three years in the Federal house

905
00:56:49,445 --> 00:56:51,615
- up in Detroit, there.
- What are you trying to get at?

906
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:54,140
They'll teach you how to
read and write up there,

907
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,654
but the rest won't be so good.

908
00:56:56,655 --> 00:56:59,653
Them boys, they can
be hard on a gimp.

909
00:56:59,654 --> 00:57:00,726
You're trying to get at me.

910
00:57:00,727 --> 00:57:04,982
Now, you give me some
good information on Ned,

911
00:57:04,983 --> 00:57:09,014
I'll take you down to Bagby's store tomorrow
and get that ball taken out of your leg.

912
00:57:09,015 --> 00:57:11,663
Then I'll give you three
days to clear the territory.

913
00:57:11,664 --> 00:57:13,974
We don't know those
boys you're looking for.

914
00:57:15,409 --> 00:57:17,998
- It ain't his leg.
- I was...

915
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:20,512
Quiet now. It's best you
let me do the talking.

916
00:57:20,513 --> 00:57:22,653
- I would say I...
- We're weary trappers.

917
00:57:24,235 --> 00:57:26,360
Who worked you over
with the ugly stick?

918
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:29,056
The man, Chaney, with the
marked face, killed my father.

919
00:57:29,057 --> 00:57:32,849
He was a whiskey drinker like you
and it led to killing in the end.

920
00:57:33,764 --> 00:57:36,160
If you answer the Marshal's
questions, he will help you.

921
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,920
I have a good lawyer at home,
and he will help you too.

922
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:41,295
I'm puzzled by this.

923
00:57:41,296 --> 00:57:42,979
Why is she here?

924
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,536
Don't go jawing with these people, Moon.
Don't you go jawing with that runt.

925
00:57:46,537 --> 00:57:50,319
I don't like you. I hope you go to jail.
My lawyer will not help you.

926
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,201
My leg is giving me fits.

927
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:54,766
A young fellow like don't
want to lose his leg.

928
00:57:54,767 --> 00:57:56,204
Easy, now.

929
00:57:56,205 --> 00:57:57,541
He's trying to get at you.

930
00:57:57,542 --> 00:57:59,956
- With the truth.
- We seen Ned and Hays two days ago.

931
00:57:59,957 --> 00:58:02,510
Don't you act the fool.
You blow, I will kill you!

932
00:58:02,511 --> 00:58:04,218
I'm played out,
I need a doctor.

933
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:06,610
We met Ned and
Hays two days ago.

934
00:58:21,256 --> 00:58:22,947
God damn it.

935
00:58:29,863 --> 00:58:31,480
Oh, Lord.

936
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:33,614
I'm dying.

937
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:36,684
Do something.

938
00:58:36,685 --> 00:58:38,263
Help me.

939
00:58:38,391 --> 00:58:40,525
I can do nothing for you, son.

940
00:58:40,526 --> 00:58:43,104
You partner's killed you,
and I have done for him.

941
00:58:43,105 --> 00:58:45,506
Don't leave me lying here.

942
00:58:45,628 --> 00:58:47,792
Don't let the wolves rip me up.

943
00:58:47,793 --> 00:58:49,514
I'll see you're buried right.

944
00:58:49,515 --> 00:58:52,111
Tell me about Ned.
Where'd you see him?

945
00:58:52,415 --> 00:58:53,937
Two days ago.

946
00:58:53,938 --> 00:58:55,711
Bagby's store.

947
00:58:55,969 --> 00:59:01,084
They were coming here tonight
to get remounts and sofky.

948
00:59:01,085 --> 00:59:04,894
They just robbed the Katy Flyer
at the Wagoner's switch.

949
00:59:05,184 --> 00:59:07,258
I'm gone.

950
00:59:09,528 --> 00:59:12,642
Send the news to my
brother, George Garrett.

951
00:59:12,643 --> 00:59:16,291
He is a Methodist Circuit
rider in south Texas.

952
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:18,780
Shall I tell him you've
outlawed up?

953
00:59:18,781 --> 00:59:19,917
It don't matter.

954
00:59:19,918 --> 00:59:22,625
He knows I'm on the scale.

955
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:27,795
I will meet him later,
walking the streets of glory.

956
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:31,672
Well, don't be looking for Quincy.

957
00:59:43,807 --> 00:59:44,995
What will we do when
they get here?

958
00:59:44,996 --> 00:59:46,530
When they ride up,

959
00:59:46,531 --> 00:59:49,361
what we want is to get
them all in the dugout.

960
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:53,311
I'll kill them the last one that goes in,
then we'll have them in a barrel.

961
00:59:53,312 --> 00:59:54,527
You'll shoot him in the back?

962
00:59:54,528 --> 00:59:57,958
It'll give them to know
our intention is serious.

963
00:59:57,984 --> 00:59:59,940
Then I'll call down.

964
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:02,676
See if they'll be taken alive.

965
01:00:02,787 --> 01:00:04,776
If they won't,

966
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:06,962
I'll shoot them as
they come out.

967
01:00:08,014 --> 01:00:11,824
I'm hopeful that three of their party being
dead will take the starch out of them.

968
01:00:14,007 --> 01:00:16,165
You display great poise.

969
01:00:18,456 --> 01:00:20,825
Aw, it's just a turkey shoot.

970
01:00:22,545 --> 01:00:26,382
One time, in New Mexico,

971
01:00:26,383 --> 01:00:29,413
we was being pursued
by seven men.

972
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:32,147
I turned Bo around and,
taking them reins in my teeth,

973
01:00:32,148 --> 01:00:36,569
rode right at them boys, firing them
two Navy Sixes I carry in my saddle.

974
01:00:37,017 --> 01:00:38,522
Well...

975
01:00:38,672 --> 01:00:41,301
I guess they was all married
men who loved their families,

976
01:00:41,302 --> 01:00:43,191
as they scattered
and run for home.

977
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:45,150
Well that is hard to believe.

978
01:00:45,151 --> 01:00:47,786
- What is?
- One man riding at seven.

979
01:00:47,787 --> 01:00:49,592
Well, it's true.

980
01:00:49,593 --> 01:00:52,248
You go for a man hard
enough and fast enough,

981
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:56,571
he don't have time to think about how
many is with him. He thinks about himself.

982
01:00:56,572 --> 01:01:00,111
And how he might get clear of that
wrath that's about to set down on him.

983
01:01:01,017 --> 01:01:02,603
Why were they pursuing you?

984
01:01:05,363 --> 01:01:07,675
I robbed a high interest bank.

985
01:01:08,194 --> 01:01:10,445
Can't rob a thief, can you?

986
01:01:10,983 --> 01:01:12,513
Never robbed a citizen.

987
01:01:12,514 --> 01:01:13,955
Never took a man's watch.

988
01:01:13,956 --> 01:01:15,455
It is all stealing.

989
01:01:15,534 --> 01:01:18,655
That's the position they
took in New Mexico.

990
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:32,357
One man.

991
01:01:32,674 --> 01:01:35,788
Did not figure them
to send a scout.

992
01:01:54,351 --> 01:01:56,613
Damn.

993
01:01:59,068 --> 01:02:01,875
It is LaBoeuf.

994
01:02:06,992 --> 01:02:09,396
Oh, we have to
warn him, Marshal.

995
01:02:16,927 --> 01:02:18,427
Too late.

996
01:02:48,367 --> 01:02:50,341
What will we do, Marshal?

997
01:02:50,342 --> 01:02:53,169
We sit.
What does he do?

998
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:15,596
Him in the wooly
chaps is Lucky Ned.

999
01:03:25,539 --> 01:03:27,497
Well, that's that.

1000
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:22,001
Well, that didn't pan out.

1001
01:04:28,877 --> 01:04:31,763
You managed to put a
kink in my rope, partner.

1002
01:04:32,694 --> 01:04:34,609
I'm severely injured.

1003
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:36,584
Yes, you got drug some.

1004
01:04:36,585 --> 01:04:38,536
I was also shot

1005
01:04:38,537 --> 01:04:39,873
by a rifle.

1006
01:04:39,874 --> 01:04:43,758
Well, that's quite possible. The
scheme did not develop as I had planned.

1007
01:04:45,101 --> 01:04:48,449
You been shot in the shoulder,
but the bullet passed through.

1008
01:04:48,605 --> 01:04:50,226
What happened to your mouth?

1009
01:04:50,562 --> 01:04:52,903
I believe I bit myself.

1010
01:04:52,904 --> 01:04:56,294
Couple of teeth loose,
and... Oh, yeah.

1011
01:04:56,295 --> 01:04:58,429
Tongue bit almost through.

1012
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:01,640
Do you want to see if it will knit,
or shall I just yank it free?

1013
01:05:01,641 --> 01:05:03,073
I know a teamster

1014
01:05:03,074 --> 01:05:05,063
bit his tongue off being
thrown from a horse.

1015
01:05:05,064 --> 01:05:08,150
After a time he learned to make
himself more or less understood.

1016
01:05:08,151 --> 01:05:09,743
I'll just yank it free.

1017
01:05:11,284 --> 01:05:12,922
What's that now?

1018
01:05:13,151 --> 01:05:14,312
What's that now?

1019
01:05:14,313 --> 01:05:16,207
Knit. Let it knit.

1020
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:17,813
Ah, very well.

1021
01:05:18,005 --> 01:05:20,603
It's impossible to
bind a tongue wound.

1022
01:05:20,604 --> 01:05:23,570
Too bad, we just run
across a doctor.

1023
01:05:23,583 --> 01:05:24,509
- Marshal?
- of sorts,

1024
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:26,286
but I do not know
where he was headed.

1025
01:05:26,336 --> 01:05:28,873
I saw him too, that's
how I came to be here.

1026
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:31,359
Neither of these
men are Chaney.

1027
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,700
I know it.
I know them both.

1028
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:35,830
That ugly one is Coke Hays.

1029
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:38,900
Him uglier still is
Clement Parmalee.

1030
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:43,340
Parmalee and his brothers have a
silver claim in Winding Stair Mountains.

1031
01:05:43,341 --> 01:05:45,873
And I bet that's where
Lucky Ned's gang is waiting.

1032
01:05:45,874 --> 01:05:47,254
Well, we'll sleep here.

1033
01:05:47,255 --> 01:05:48,944
We'll follow in the morning.

1034
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,238
But we promised to bury
the poor soul inside.

1035
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:53,191
Ground's too hard.

1036
01:05:53,192 --> 01:05:57,583
Them men wanted a decent burial, they should
have gotten themselves killed in summer.

1037
01:06:01,635 --> 01:06:03,341
Sleep well, Little Blackie.

1038
01:06:03,342 --> 01:06:06,902
I have a notion that tomorrow
we will reach our object.

1039
01:06:07,101 --> 01:06:09,060
We're hot on the trail.

1040
01:06:09,426 --> 01:06:13,155
Seems that we'll overtake Tom Chaney
at the Winding Stair Mountain.

1041
01:06:13,452 --> 01:06:15,691
I'd not want to be in his shoes.

1042
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:27,352
As I understand it, Chaney,

1043
01:06:27,353 --> 01:06:30,720
or Chelmsford, as he
called himself in Texas,

1044
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:32,608
shot the Senator's dog.

1045
01:06:32,609 --> 01:06:34,751
When the Senator remonstrated,

1046
01:06:34,752 --> 01:06:36,601
Chelmsford shot him as well.

1047
01:06:36,602 --> 01:06:37,800
Now you could argue

1048
01:06:37,801 --> 01:06:41,765
that the shooting of the dog was
merely an instance of malum prohibitum.

1049
01:06:41,815 --> 01:06:45,716
But the shooting of a senator is
indubitably an instance of malum in se.

1050
01:06:45,717 --> 01:06:47,458
Malla-men what?

1051
01:06:47,459 --> 01:06:48,785
Malum in se.

1052
01:06:48,786 --> 01:06:52,069
The distinction is between an
act that is wrong in itself

1053
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:55,349
and an act that is wrong only
according to our laws and mores.

1054
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:57,022
It is Latin.

1055
01:06:57,954 --> 01:06:59,769
I'm struck.

1056
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:01,752
That LaBoeuf

1057
01:07:01,753 --> 01:07:05,755
has been shot, trampled, and
nearly severed his tongue.

1058
01:07:06,295 --> 01:07:11,261
Not only does he not cease to talk,
but he spills the banks of English.

1059
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:19,155
I was within 300 yards
of Chelmsford once.

1060
01:07:19,868 --> 01:07:22,052
The closest I have been.

1061
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,500
With a Sharps carbine,
that is within range.

1062
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:29,764
But I was mounted and had
the choice of firing off-hand

1063
01:07:29,765 --> 01:07:31,742
or dismounting to shoot from rest,

1064
01:07:31,743 --> 01:07:35,190
which would allow Chelmsford
to augment the distance.

1065
01:07:36,441 --> 01:07:38,365
I fired mounted,

1066
01:07:40,088 --> 01:07:41,937
and fired wild.

1067
01:07:46,048 --> 01:07:51,381
You cannot hit a man at 300 yards
if your gun was resting on Gibraltar.

1068
01:07:51,544 --> 01:07:55,176
A Sharps carbine is an instrument
of uncanny power and precision.

1069
01:07:55,177 --> 01:07:58,466
I have no doubt that
the gun is sound.

1070
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:03,494
<i>My clothes are all ragged and
my language is rough.</i>

1071
01:08:03,495 --> 01:08:08,165
<i>My bread is corn dodgers,
both solid and tough.</i>

1072
01:08:08,166 --> 01:08:12,982
<i>And yet I'm happy, and live at my ease</i>

1073
01:08:12,983 --> 01:08:17,300
<i>On sorghum molasses,
and bacon, and cheese.</i>

1074
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:20,064
Greer County Bachelor.

1075
01:08:22,921 --> 01:08:25,025
I do not believe he slept.

1076
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:35,429
Fort Smith is a healthy
distance, LaBoeuf.

1077
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:38,618
I would encourage the
creature you ride to head at her.

1078
01:08:38,619 --> 01:08:42,590
Out here a one-armed
man looks like easy prey.

1079
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,629
And a one eyed man
who can't shoot?

1080
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:47,579
Why don't you
turn back, Cogburn?

1081
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:48,864
I'll do fine.

1082
01:08:48,865 --> 01:08:51,133
I know where the
Parmalee claim is.

1083
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:55,850
I'm uninjured, well provisioned
and we agreed to separate.

1084
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:00,120
In conscience you cannot cite our
agreement. You're the one who shot me.

1085
01:09:00,121 --> 01:09:02,174
Mr. LaBoeuf has a point, Marshal.

1086
01:09:02,175 --> 01:09:06,174
It is an unfair leg up in any competition
to shoot your opposite number.

1087
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:09,401
God damn it. I do not accept it as
a given that I did shoot LaBoeuf.

1088
01:09:09,402 --> 01:09:11,425
There were plenty
of guns going off.

1089
01:09:11,426 --> 01:09:13,814
I heard the rifle,
and I felt the ball.

1090
01:09:13,815 --> 01:09:15,670
You missed your shot, Cogburn.

1091
01:09:15,671 --> 01:09:17,069
Missed my shot!

1092
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:21,021
You are more handicapped without
the eye, than I without the arm.

1093
01:09:21,022 --> 01:09:24,159
I can hit a gnat's
eye at 90 yards.

1094
01:09:35,231 --> 01:09:38,124
That China-man is running
them cheap shells on me again.

1095
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,962
I thought you were going to
say the sun was in your eyes.

1096
01:09:41,113 --> 01:09:44,266
That is to say, your eye.

1097
01:10:28,461 --> 01:10:30,570
Two at one time.

1098
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:46,923
I'm going to chuck one high.

1099
01:10:46,924 --> 01:10:48,599
Go far.

1100
01:10:56,667 --> 01:10:58,869
- There.
- There?

1101
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:01,048
- My bullet.
- Your bullet?

1102
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:04,009
If you hit what you aim at,
explain my shoulder.

1103
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,052
Gentlemen, shooting cornbread
out here on the prairie

1104
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,052
is getting us no closer
to the Ned Pepper gang.

1105
01:11:08,053 --> 01:11:10,492
One more.
This will prove it.

1106
01:11:10,493 --> 01:11:12,673
Please hold fire.

1107
01:12:37,231 --> 01:12:39,485
Find our way back.

1108
01:12:39,486 --> 01:12:42,240
Where you've been to...

1109
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:55,830
Lucky Ned?

1110
01:13:06,851 --> 01:13:08,699
Lucky Ned!

1111
01:13:10,707 --> 01:13:12,414
Very good, Cogburn.

1112
01:13:12,415 --> 01:13:14,212
Now what?

1113
01:13:19,965 --> 01:13:22,160
Oh, God damn it.

1114
01:13:22,195 --> 01:13:25,204
Cogburn does not want me
eating out of his store.

1115
01:13:25,205 --> 01:13:28,108
I am assuming you have not eaten
all day. And it is my store, not his.

1116
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:30,231
Let him starve.

1117
01:13:31,712 --> 01:13:33,417
He did not track.

1118
01:13:33,418 --> 01:13:34,904
He did not shoot.

1119
01:13:34,905 --> 01:13:36,555
Except at food stuffs.

1120
01:13:36,556 --> 01:13:38,447
That was your initiative.

1121
01:13:38,448 --> 01:13:39,747
He did not contribute.

1122
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:43,634
He's a man who walks
in front of bullets.

1123
01:13:43,635 --> 01:13:46,274
Mr. LaBoeuf drew single-handed
upon the Lucky Ned Pepper gang

1124
01:13:46,275 --> 01:13:48,155
while we fired safely from cover.

1125
01:13:48,156 --> 01:13:50,741
- We?
- It is unfair to indict a man

1126
01:13:50,742 --> 01:13:52,743
when his jaw is swollen,
and tongue mangled

1127
01:13:52,744 --> 01:13:55,147
and who is therefore unable
to rise to his own defense.

1128
01:13:55,148 --> 01:13:56,767
I can speak for myself.

1129
01:13:56,768 --> 01:14:02,311
I am hardly obliged to answer the ravings
of a drunkard, and it is beneath me.

1130
01:14:03,288 --> 01:14:07,389
I shall make my
own camp elsewhere.

1131
01:14:08,059 --> 01:14:11,137
It is you who has nothing
to offer, Cogburn.

1132
01:14:11,138 --> 01:14:13,290
A sad picture indeed.

1133
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:15,349
This is no longer a man hunt.

1134
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,234
It is a debauch.

1135
01:14:17,266 --> 01:14:18,867
The Texas Ranger

1136
01:14:18,868 --> 01:14:21,593
presses on, alone.

1137
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:24,859
Take the girl.

1138
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,598
I bow out.

1139
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:32,319
A fine thing to decide once you brought her
into the middle of the Choctaw Nation.

1140
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,209
I bow out. I wash my hands.

1141
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:36,233
Gentlemen, we cannot
fall out in this fashion.

1142
01:14:36,234 --> 01:14:39,153
Not so close to our goal,
with Tom Chaney nearly in hand.

1143
01:14:39,154 --> 01:14:41,564
In hand?

1144
01:14:41,565 --> 01:14:45,707
If he is not in a shallow grave somewhere
between here and Fort Smith,

1145
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:47,546
he is gone.

1146
01:14:47,547 --> 01:14:49,183
Long gone.

1147
01:14:49,314 --> 01:14:52,869
Thanks to Mr. LaBoeuf,
we missed our shot.

1148
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:55,379
We've barked and
the birds have flown.

1149
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,498
Gone, gone, gone.

1150
01:14:57,499 --> 01:14:59,747
Lucky Ned and
his cohort gone.

1151
01:14:59,748 --> 01:15:01,533
Your $50 gone.

1152
01:15:01,534 --> 01:15:03,034
Gone the whiskey,

1153
01:15:03,035 --> 01:15:05,276
seized in evidence.

1154
01:15:05,559 --> 01:15:08,532
The trail is cold,
if there ever was one.

1155
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:17,734
I'm... I'm a foolish old man who's
been drawn into a wild goose chase

1156
01:15:17,735 --> 01:15:22,305
by a harpy in trousers,
and a nincompoop.

1157
01:15:22,538 --> 01:15:25,189
Ah, Mr. LaBoeuf.

1158
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:28,381
He can wander the Choctaw
Nation for as long as he likes.

1159
01:15:28,382 --> 01:15:31,209
Perhaps the local
Indians will take him in.

1160
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:34,449
Honor his gibbering
by making him chief.

1161
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:38,185
You, sister, may
go where you like.

1162
01:15:38,553 --> 01:15:41,460
Our engagement is terminated.

1163
01:15:43,052 --> 01:15:44,897
I bow out.

1164
01:15:52,324 --> 01:15:53,743
I'm going with you.

1165
01:15:53,744 --> 01:15:55,995
No, that is not possible.

1166
01:15:55,996 --> 01:15:58,070
Have I held you back?

1167
01:15:58,328 --> 01:16:01,715
I have a Colt Dragoon revolver,
which I know how to use.

1168
01:16:01,716 --> 01:16:04,351
And I will be no more of a burden
to you than I was to the Marshal.

1169
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:05,950
That is not my worry.

1170
01:16:05,951 --> 01:16:07,924
You've earned your spurs.

1171
01:16:07,925 --> 01:16:09,540
That is clear now.

1172
01:16:09,701 --> 01:16:13,318
You've been an regular
old hand on the trail.

1173
01:16:14,061 --> 01:16:15,746
But Cogburn's right,

1174
01:16:15,747 --> 01:16:19,100
even if I will not give him the
satisfaction of conceding it.

1175
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:22,283
The trail is cold.

1176
01:16:23,382 --> 01:16:25,541
And I am

1177
01:16:25,997 --> 01:16:28,212
considerably diminished.

1178
01:16:28,213 --> 01:16:32,195
How can you give up now, after the many
months you've dedicated to finding Chaney?

1179
01:16:32,787 --> 01:16:35,022
You have shown
great determination.

1180
01:16:36,142 --> 01:16:38,055
I misjudged you.

1181
01:16:41,554 --> 01:16:43,496
I picked the wrong man.

1182
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:50,768
I would go on in your company,
if there were a clear way to go.

1183
01:16:52,144 --> 01:16:54,787
But we'd be striking out blindly.

1184
01:16:56,016 --> 01:16:57,863
Chelmsford's gone.

1185
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:01,341
We chased him
right off the map.

1186
01:17:02,415 --> 01:17:04,211
There's nothing for it.

1187
01:17:08,228 --> 01:17:10,165
I'm bound for Texas.

1188
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:13,393
Time for you to go home, too.

1189
01:17:14,131 --> 01:17:16,643
The Marshal, when he sobers,

1190
01:17:17,806 --> 01:17:19,214
is your way back.

1191
01:17:19,215 --> 01:17:22,527
I will not go back. Not without
Chaney, dead or alive.

1192
01:17:25,721 --> 01:17:27,999
I misjudged you as well.

1193
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:32,961
I extend my hand.

1194
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:34,982
Mr. LaBoeuf, please.

1195
01:17:47,259 --> 01:17:49,264
Adios.

1196
01:19:37,275 --> 01:19:39,069
I know you.

1197
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:43,371
Your name is Mattie.

1198
01:19:43,372 --> 01:19:45,718
You're little Mattie,
the bookkeeper.

1199
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:48,945
Isn't that something.

1200
01:19:48,946 --> 01:19:51,060
Yes, and I know you,
Tom Chaney.

1201
01:19:53,564 --> 01:19:55,285
What are you doing out here?

1202
01:19:55,286 --> 01:19:56,574
Come to fetch some water.

1203
01:19:56,575 --> 01:19:58,762
No, what are you doing
in these mountains here?

1204
01:19:58,763 --> 01:20:00,644
Well, I've not been
formerly deputized,

1205
01:20:00,645 --> 01:20:02,821
but I'm acting as an agent for
Marshal Reuben Cogburn

1206
01:20:02,822 --> 01:20:04,573
and Judge Parker's court.

1207
01:20:10,225 --> 01:20:12,890
I have come to take
you back to Fort Smith.

1208
01:20:18,134 --> 01:20:19,822
Well, I will not go.

1209
01:20:19,823 --> 01:20:20,834
How do you like that?

1210
01:20:20,835 --> 01:20:24,461
There's a posse of officers up
there who will force you to go.

1211
01:20:24,462 --> 01:20:26,302
That is interesting news.

1212
01:20:26,303 --> 01:20:27,959
And how many is up there?

1213
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,650
Right around fifty.

1214
01:20:29,651 --> 01:20:31,992
They're all well armed
and they mean business.

1215
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:33,130
What I want you to do now

1216
01:20:33,131 --> 01:20:35,270
is to come on across the creek and
walk in front of me up that hill.

1217
01:20:36,232 --> 01:20:40,096
I think I'll oblige the
officers to come after me.

1218
01:20:40,405 --> 01:20:43,000
Well if you refuse to go,
I will have to shoot you.

1219
01:20:43,169 --> 01:20:44,169
Oh.

1220
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:46,946
Well you'd better
cock your piece.

1221
01:20:48,767 --> 01:20:50,304
All the way back.

1222
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,881
- 'Til it locks.
- I know how to do it.

1223
01:20:54,051 --> 01:20:55,318
Will you not go with me?

1224
01:20:55,319 --> 01:20:56,812
No, it's just the
other way around.

1225
01:20:56,813 --> 01:20:58,565
You're going with me.

1226
01:20:58,631 --> 01:21:00,131
I'm... Ah!

1227
01:21:08,886 --> 01:21:10,954
I did not think you would do it.

1228
01:21:10,955 --> 01:21:14,296
- What do you think now?
- One of my short ribs is broken.

1229
01:21:14,297 --> 01:21:17,126
You killed my father when
he was trying to help you.

1230
01:21:17,127 --> 01:21:20,041
I have one of the gold pieces you
stole from him. Now give me the other.

1231
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:22,521
- Things aren't going right for me...
- Mattie!

1232
01:21:22,522 --> 01:21:24,414
- I'm down here.
- Now I'm shot by a child.

1233
01:21:24,415 --> 01:21:26,514
Chaney is taken into custody.

1234
01:21:32,553 --> 01:21:33,553
Help me!

1235
01:21:33,554 --> 01:21:35,079
Mattie!

1236
01:21:37,527 --> 01:21:39,027
Marshal.

1237
01:21:44,871 --> 01:21:47,601
Take them horses
you got and move!

1238
01:21:52,726 --> 01:21:55,824
Tom, you get on up that hill.
Don't you stop.

1239
01:21:59,033 --> 01:22:00,138
Who all's down there?

1240
01:22:00,139 --> 01:22:02,592
Marshal Cogburn
and 50 more officers.

1241
01:22:08,528 --> 01:22:11,437
You tell me another lie
and I'll stove your head in.

1242
01:22:11,466 --> 01:22:13,462
Just the Marshal.

1243
01:22:14,687 --> 01:22:16,622
Rooster.

1244
01:22:18,236 --> 01:22:19,758
Cogburn!

1245
01:22:19,843 --> 01:22:21,606
You hear me?

1246
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,485
You answer me, Rooster.

1247
01:22:27,158 --> 01:22:29,116
I will kill this girl.

1248
01:22:29,117 --> 01:22:30,931
You know I will do it.

1249
01:22:32,175 --> 01:22:35,504
The girl is nothing to me.
She's a runaway from Arkansas.

1250
01:22:35,505 --> 01:22:37,506
That is all very well.

1251
01:22:37,507 --> 01:22:40,154
Do you advise that I kill her?

1252
01:22:42,443 --> 01:22:44,264
Do what you think is best, Ned.

1253
01:22:44,265 --> 01:22:47,487
She's nothing to
me but a lost child.

1254
01:22:50,088 --> 01:22:51,392
Think it over first.

1255
01:22:51,393 --> 01:22:53,511
I have already
thought it over.

1256
01:22:53,512 --> 01:22:55,771
You'll get mounted double fast.

1257
01:22:55,772 --> 01:22:59,194
If I see you riding over that
bald ridge to the northwest,

1258
01:22:59,195 --> 01:23:01,122
I will spare the girl.

1259
01:23:01,328 --> 01:23:02,862
You have five minutes.

1260
01:23:02,863 --> 01:23:05,639
There will be a party of
marshals here soon, Ned.

1261
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:10,214
Let me have the girl and Chaney
and I will mislead them for six hours.

1262
01:23:10,215 --> 01:23:11,952
Too thin, Rooster.

1263
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:13,503
Too thin.

1264
01:23:13,703 --> 01:23:15,433
Your five minutes is running.

1265
01:23:15,434 --> 01:23:17,525
No more talk.

1266
01:23:20,505 --> 01:23:22,439
Run up that hill.

1267
01:23:33,377 --> 01:23:36,033
Farrell, see to Tom's wounds.

1268
01:23:36,034 --> 01:23:37,661
Can I have some
of that bacon?

1269
01:23:37,662 --> 01:23:39,256
You help yourself.

1270
01:23:39,259 --> 01:23:40,624
Have some of the coffee.

1271
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:43,338
I do not drink coffee.
I am fourteen.

1272
01:23:43,547 --> 01:23:47,120
Well we do not have buttermilk,
and we do not have bread.

1273
01:23:47,121 --> 01:23:48,595
We are poorly supplied.

1274
01:23:48,596 --> 01:23:50,419
- Where is she?
- What are you doing here?

1275
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:53,754
- I ought to wring your scrawny neck.
- You let that go.

1276
01:23:55,485 --> 01:23:56,849
What happened, huh?

1277
01:23:56,850 --> 01:23:59,214
I will tell you, and you will
see that I am in the right.

1278
01:23:59,215 --> 01:24:01,376
Tom Chaney there shot
my father to death

1279
01:24:01,377 --> 01:24:02,455
at Fort Smith and
robbed him of

1280
01:24:02,456 --> 01:24:04,403
two gold pieces and
stole his mare.

1281
01:24:04,404 --> 01:24:07,596
I was informed Mr. Cogburn had grit
and I hired him to find the murderer.

1282
01:24:07,597 --> 01:24:10,649
A few minutes ago I came upon
Chaney watering the horses.

1283
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:13,098
He would not be taken in
charge and I shot him.

1284
01:24:13,428 --> 01:24:17,991
If I had killed him, I would not now
be in this fix, but my revolver misfired.

1285
01:24:17,992 --> 01:24:19,537
They will do it.

1286
01:24:19,611 --> 01:24:21,853
It'll embarrass you every time.

1287
01:24:22,076 --> 01:24:25,285
Most girls like to play pretties,
but you like guns, do ya?

1288
01:24:25,286 --> 01:24:26,914
I do not care a thing in
the world about guns.

1289
01:24:26,915 --> 01:24:28,433
If I did, I would have
one that worked.

1290
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:30,553
I was shot in an ambush, Ned.

1291
01:24:30,554 --> 01:24:33,517
The horses was blowing, making noise.
It was that officer that got me.

1292
01:24:33,518 --> 01:24:35,649
How can you sit there and
tell such a big story?

1293
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:38,405
That pit is a hundred feet deep,
and I will throw you in it.

1294
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,653
I will leave you to
scream and rot.

1295
01:24:40,654 --> 01:24:42,525
- Now how do you like that?
- No you won't.

1296
01:24:42,526 --> 01:24:43,520
This man will not let
you have your way.

1297
01:24:43,521 --> 01:24:45,553
He's your boss and you
have to do as he tells you.

1298
01:24:46,631 --> 01:24:48,820
Ain't nothing going my way.

1299
01:24:49,124 --> 01:24:51,449
Was that Rooster that
waylaid us night before last?

1300
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:53,529
It was Marshal Cogburn
and myself.

1301
01:24:53,530 --> 01:24:55,309
You and Cogburn?

1302
01:24:55,742 --> 01:24:57,528
Quite the posse.

1303
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:16,784
Let us move, Ned.

1304
01:25:16,785 --> 01:25:18,572
In good time, Doctor.

1305
01:25:18,573 --> 01:25:20,654
What happened to
Quincy and the kid?

1306
01:25:22,661 --> 01:25:24,201
They're both dead.

1307
01:25:25,345 --> 01:25:27,837
I was in the very middle of it,
it was a terrible thing to see.

1308
01:25:27,838 --> 01:25:29,697
Please, let us move, Ned.

1309
01:25:29,698 --> 01:25:31,231
The Marshal's gone.

1310
01:25:31,232 --> 01:25:33,036
Do you need a good lawyer?

1311
01:25:33,067 --> 01:25:35,114
I need a good judge.

1312
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:37,183
What happened to Coke Hays?

1313
01:25:37,184 --> 01:25:39,159
The old fellow shot
off his horse.

1314
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,034
Dead as well.

1315
01:25:41,322 --> 01:25:43,686
His depredations have
come to an end.

1316
01:25:43,853 --> 01:25:46,696
Your friend Rooster does
not collect many prisoners.

1317
01:25:46,697 --> 01:25:48,422
He is not my friend.

1318
01:25:50,122 --> 01:25:52,732
He's abandoned me
to a congress of louts.

1319
01:25:52,733 --> 01:25:55,202
You do not varnish your opinion.

1320
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:56,756
Are we off?

1321
01:25:56,757 --> 01:25:59,295
Let us cut up the winnings
from the Katy Flyer.

1322
01:25:59,296 --> 01:26:01,404
There'll be time for
that at the old place.

1323
01:26:01,405 --> 01:26:03,924
- I will mount the grey.
- I have other plans for you.

1324
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:06,045
Must I double mount
with the doctor?

1325
01:26:06,046 --> 01:26:07,367
- Move.
- No.

1326
01:26:07,368 --> 01:26:09,906
Too chancey with two men
up if it comes to a race.

1327
01:26:09,907 --> 01:26:11,748
Tom, you wait here with the girl.

1328
01:26:11,749 --> 01:26:14,964
When we reach Ma's house, I'll send
Farrell back with a fresh mount.

1329
01:26:14,965 --> 01:26:16,835
You will be out by dark.

1330
01:26:16,961 --> 01:26:18,204
We'll meet you at the old place.

1331
01:26:18,205 --> 01:26:19,915
I do not like that.

1332
01:26:19,916 --> 01:26:23,152
Let me ride with you, Ned.
Just out of here, anyway.

1333
01:26:23,153 --> 01:26:24,349
No. We are short a horse.

1334
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:26,023
The marshals will come swarming.

1335
01:26:26,024 --> 01:26:27,733
Hours, if they come here at all.

1336
01:26:27,734 --> 01:26:29,241
They'll think that we've all gone.

1337
01:26:29,242 --> 01:26:31,976
I am not staying here
by myself with Tom Chaney.

1338
01:26:31,977 --> 01:26:33,219
That's the way I will have it.

1339
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:34,349
He will kill me.

1340
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:38,008
You heard him say it. He's killed my
father, and now you will let him kill me.

1341
01:26:38,009 --> 01:26:39,647
He will do no such thing.

1342
01:26:39,648 --> 01:26:44,565
Tom, you know the crossing at Cypress
Forks, near the log meeting house.

1343
01:26:44,566 --> 01:26:47,257
When you're mounted, you take
the girl and leave her there.

1344
01:26:47,258 --> 01:26:48,749
You understand, Tom?

1345
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:51,683
Any harm comes to that child,

1346
01:26:51,684 --> 01:26:53,317
you'll not get paid.

1347
01:26:55,484 --> 01:26:58,613
Harold, let me ride up with you.

1348
01:26:59,036 --> 01:27:02,387
Harold, I will pay you
$50 out of my winnings.

1349
01:27:02,388 --> 01:27:04,196
I am not heavy.

1350
01:27:04,197 --> 01:27:06,481
Do the calf again, Harold.

1351
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:36,036
Everything is against me.

1352
01:27:36,315 --> 01:27:38,369
You have no reason to whine.

1353
01:27:39,033 --> 01:27:40,958
You act as the bandit chief
instructed and no harm comes to me,

1354
01:27:40,959 --> 01:27:43,460
you will get your winnings
at the old place.

1355
01:27:43,461 --> 01:27:47,767
Lucky Ned has left me. I'm sure to
be caught when I leave on foot.

1356
01:27:48,107 --> 01:27:51,429
Must think over my position
and how I may improve it.

1357
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:54,255
Where's the second
California gold piece?

1358
01:27:56,481 --> 01:27:57,833
What have you done
with Papa's mare?

1359
01:27:57,834 --> 01:27:59,621
Keep still.

1360
01:27:59,831 --> 01:28:02,029
Are you thinking
about the old place?

1361
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:04,083
Look here, if you let me go,

1362
01:28:04,084 --> 01:28:05,505
I will swear to an affidavit,

1363
01:28:05,506 --> 01:28:09,939
and once you are brought to justice,
it may go easier on you.

1364
01:28:10,877 --> 01:28:13,408
I tell you, I can do better.

1365
01:28:19,281 --> 01:28:21,898
I don't need your affidavit.

1366
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:29,474
All I need is your silence.

1367
01:28:33,826 --> 01:28:36,264
Your father was a
busybody like you.

1368
01:28:36,265 --> 01:28:39,075
In honesty, I do not
regret shooting him.

1369
01:28:39,076 --> 01:28:41,376
He thought Tom
Chaney was small.

1370
01:28:41,377 --> 01:28:42,803
And you...

1371
01:28:42,804 --> 01:28:44,748
You would give
me an affidavit...

1372
01:28:44,749 --> 01:28:47,205
You're all against
me, everybody...

1373
01:28:52,669 --> 01:28:54,899
That is Chelmsford.

1374
01:28:55,954 --> 01:28:58,735
Strange to be so
close to him at last.

1375
01:28:58,736 --> 01:29:02,012
Mr. LaBoeuf, how is
it that you are here?

1376
01:29:02,131 --> 01:29:03,489
I heard a shot.

1377
01:29:03,490 --> 01:29:05,564
Went down to the river.

1378
01:29:05,702 --> 01:29:08,076
Cogburn outlined a plan.

1379
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:10,510
Mind your footing,
there's a pit there.

1380
01:29:10,769 --> 01:29:12,447
His part

1381
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,571
I fear is rash.

1382
01:29:16,456 --> 01:29:19,066
He returns for Lucky Ned.

1383
01:29:35,732 --> 01:29:37,480
Hello, Rooster!

1384
01:29:37,515 --> 01:29:39,905
Will you give us the road?

1385
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:42,656
One against four is ill-advised.

1386
01:29:42,665 --> 01:29:44,380
He would not be dissuaded.

1387
01:29:44,381 --> 01:29:47,757
Hello, Ned. How many
men is with the girl?

1388
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,164
Just Chaney.

1389
01:29:49,165 --> 01:29:51,265
Our agreement is in force.

1390
01:29:51,266 --> 01:29:54,770
She was in excellent health
when last I saw her.

1391
01:29:55,172 --> 01:29:59,624
Farrell, I want you and
your brother to stand clear.

1392
01:29:59,973 --> 01:30:01,796
You as well, Doctor.

1393
01:30:01,797 --> 01:30:04,485
Have no interest in you today.

1394
01:30:05,121 --> 01:30:07,383
What is your intention, Rooster?

1395
01:30:07,384 --> 01:30:10,132
You think one on
four is a dogfall?

1396
01:30:10,194 --> 01:30:13,384
I mean to kill you in
one minute, Ned.

1397
01:30:13,482 --> 01:30:17,932
Or see you hanged at Fort Smith
at Judge Parker's convenience.

1398
01:30:18,223 --> 01:30:20,189
Which will you have?

1399
01:30:20,618 --> 01:30:22,889
I call that bold talk

1400
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:25,072
from a one-eyed fat man.

1401
01:30:29,224 --> 01:30:32,386
Fill your hand,
you son of a bitch.

1402
01:30:47,034 --> 01:30:48,359
Shoot them, Mr. LaBoeuf.

1403
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,133
Too far, moving too fast.

1404
01:31:32,466 --> 01:31:34,210
Well, Rooster,

1405
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,616
I'm shot to pieces.

1406
01:31:38,716 --> 01:31:40,920
Seems neither of us

1407
01:31:40,921 --> 01:31:43,294
gets to see Judge Parker.

1408
01:31:51,533 --> 01:31:53,183
Oh, Lord.

1409
01:32:04,861 --> 01:32:06,046
Wahoo!

1410
01:32:06,047 --> 01:32:07,909
Some bully shot.

1411
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:10,462
That was 400 yards, at least.

1412
01:32:10,986 --> 01:32:12,486
Well,

1413
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,570
the Sharps carbine is a...

1414
01:32:29,472 --> 01:32:31,692
Stand up, Tom Chaney.

1415
01:33:07,966 --> 01:33:10,934
M... Mr. LaBoeuf.

1416
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:16,550
Are you alive?

1417
01:34:29,305 --> 01:34:31,166
Mr. LaBoeuf!

1418
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:37,637
Mr. LaBoeuf.

1419
01:34:38,957 --> 01:34:40,856
Mr. LaBoeuf.

1420
01:34:44,104 --> 01:34:45,604
Are you there?

1421
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:47,139
I'm here.

1422
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:48,791
Can you clamber out?

1423
01:34:48,792 --> 01:34:49,792
I cannot.

1424
01:34:49,793 --> 01:34:51,279
There are snakes.

1425
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,552
They awake?

1426
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:54,295
Yes.

1427
01:35:07,001 --> 01:35:08,554
I'm bit.

1428
01:35:18,503 --> 01:35:20,354
Does Mr. LaBoeuf survive?

1429
01:35:20,355 --> 01:35:24,664
He does. Even a blow to the head could
silence him for only a few short minutes.

1430
01:35:24,665 --> 01:35:26,280
Where are you bit?

1431
01:35:31,589 --> 01:35:33,453
Look away, Mattie.

1432
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:00,918
I have her.

1433
01:36:00,919 --> 01:36:02,898
Up with us.

1434
01:36:09,192 --> 01:36:11,962
Here Mr. LaBoeuf, take her.

1435
01:36:13,078 --> 01:36:14,851
She's snake bit.

1436
01:36:17,243 --> 01:36:18,686
We're off.

1437
01:36:18,838 --> 01:36:21,022
I'll send help for
you soon as I can.

1438
01:36:21,023 --> 01:36:22,637
Don't wander off.

1439
01:36:23,245 --> 01:36:25,223
We are not leaving him.

1440
01:36:25,616 --> 01:36:28,701
We must get you to a doc, sis,
or you're not going to make it.

1441
01:36:28,836 --> 01:36:30,717
I'm in your debt for
that shot, pard.

1442
01:36:30,718 --> 01:36:32,905
Never doubt the
Texas Ranger.

1443
01:36:32,929 --> 01:36:34,435
Come on.

1444
01:36:35,587 --> 01:36:37,439
Ever stalwart.

1445
01:37:39,701 --> 01:37:41,305
We must stop.

1446
01:37:41,306 --> 01:37:43,491
Little Blackie is played out.

1447
01:37:44,103 --> 01:37:45,734
We have miles yet.

1448
01:37:47,103 --> 01:37:48,603
Come on, you.

1449
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:50,450
No!

1450
01:37:52,789 --> 01:37:54,696
That's it, come on now.

1451
01:37:55,267 --> 01:37:56,767
No, stop.

1452
01:38:17,662 --> 01:38:19,561
He's getting away.

1453
01:38:19,562 --> 01:38:21,319
Who's getting away, sis?

1454
01:38:22,047 --> 01:38:23,547
Chaney.

1455
01:38:58,633 --> 01:39:00,477
No... No!

1456
01:39:00,478 --> 01:39:02,751
No, no, no.

1457
01:39:04,134 --> 01:39:05,734
Oh, no.

1458
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:12,615
No, stop.

1459
01:40:39,363 --> 01:40:41,660
I'm growing old.

1460
01:41:03,159 --> 01:41:06,018
A quarter-century
is a long time.

1461
01:41:20,757 --> 01:41:22,691
By the time we reached
Bagby's store,

1462
01:41:22,692 --> 01:41:24,827
my hand had turned black.

1463
01:41:25,186 --> 01:41:27,868
I was not awake
when I lost the arm.

1464
01:41:30,753 --> 01:41:33,205
The Marshal had stayed
with me, I was told,

1465
01:41:33,206 --> 01:41:34,941
'til I was out of danger.

1466
01:41:34,942 --> 01:41:37,490
But he departed before
I came around.

1467
01:41:37,902 --> 01:41:40,573
Once home, I wrote him
with an invitation

1468
01:41:40,574 --> 01:41:43,986
to come by the next time he
found himself near Yell County.

1469
01:41:43,987 --> 01:41:47,140
And collect the
$50 I still owed him.

1470
01:41:47,547 --> 01:41:49,808
I did not hear back
from Marshal Cogburn.

1471
01:41:49,809 --> 01:41:51,702
And he did not appear.

1472
01:41:53,531 --> 01:41:58,102
Then one day, I received a note from
the Marshal, with a flyer enclosed.

1473
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:02,341
He said he was traveling
with a Wild West show.

1474
01:42:02,342 --> 01:42:03,883
Getting older and fatter.

1475
01:42:03,884 --> 01:42:07,307
Would I like to come visit him
when the show came to Memphis,

1476
01:42:07,308 --> 01:42:10,177
and swap stories with
an old trail mate.

1477
01:42:11,175 --> 01:42:14,083
He would understand if the
journey were too long.

1478
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:19,970
Brief though his note was,

1479
01:42:20,227 --> 01:42:22,531
it was rife with misspellings.

1480
01:42:23,495 --> 01:42:24,936
Yes'm?

1481
01:42:24,937 --> 01:42:26,882
I am Cole Younger.

1482
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:29,157
This is Mr. James.

1483
01:42:30,189 --> 01:42:34,000
It grieves me to tell you that
you have missed Rooster.

1484
01:42:34,078 --> 01:42:36,478
He passed away
three days ago

1485
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:39,367
when the show was
at Jonesboro, Arkansas.

1486
01:42:39,368 --> 01:42:42,426
Buried him there in a
Confederate cemetery.

1487
01:42:43,663 --> 01:42:47,720
Reuben had a complaint,
what he referred to as "night hoss".

1488
01:42:47,721 --> 01:42:51,475
And I believe the warm
weather was too much for him.

1489
01:42:52,443 --> 01:42:55,632
We had some lively times.

1490
01:42:56,359 --> 01:42:59,478
What was the nature
of your acquaintance?

1491
01:43:00,134 --> 01:43:02,639
I knew the marshal long ago.

1492
01:43:02,957 --> 01:43:06,632
We, too, had...
lively times.

1493
01:43:08,204 --> 01:43:10,028
Thank you, Mr. Younger.

1494
01:43:12,184 --> 01:43:14,384
Keep your seat, trash.

1495
01:43:16,173 --> 01:43:20,574
I had the body removed to our plot
and I had visited it over the years.

1496
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:27,330
No doubt people talk about that.

1497
01:43:27,505 --> 01:43:30,703
They say, "Well, she
hardly knew the man."

1498
01:43:30,704 --> 01:43:33,401
"Isn't she a cranky old maid."

1499
01:43:33,896 --> 01:43:36,262
It is true, I have not married.

1500
01:43:36,263 --> 01:43:38,687
I never had time to fool with it.

1501
01:43:41,553 --> 01:43:44,975
I heard nothing more of
the Texas officer, LaBoeuf.

1502
01:43:44,976 --> 01:43:48,515
If he is yet alive, I would be
pleased to hear from him.

1503
01:43:48,724 --> 01:43:50,934
I judge he would be
in his seventies now.

1504
01:43:50,935 --> 01:43:53,295
And nearer eighty
than seventy.

1505
01:43:53,745 --> 01:43:57,475
I expect some of the starch
has gone out of that cowlick.

1506
01:43:58,950 --> 01:44:01,285
Time just gets away from us.

1507
01:44:09,579 --> 01:44:15,263
<i>What a fellowship,
what a joy divine,</i>

1508
01:44:15,264 --> 01:44:21,162
<i>Leaning on the everlasting arms.</i>

1509
01:44:21,163 --> 01:44:27,385
<i>What a blessedness,
what a peace is mine,</i>

1510
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:34,453
<i>Leaning on the everlasting arms.</i>

1511
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:40,962
<i>Leaning, leaning,</i>

1512
01:44:40,963 --> 01:44:47,257
<i>Safe and secure from all alarms.</i>

1513
01:44:47,258 --> 01:44:53,032
<i>Leaning, leaning,</i>

1514
01:44:53,033 --> 01:45:00,334
<i>Leaning on the everlasting arms.</i>

1515
01:45:01,443 --> 01:45:07,162
<i>Oh, how sweet to walk
in this pilgrim way,</i>

1516
01:45:07,163 --> 01:45:13,613
<i>Leaning on the everlasting arms</i>

1517
01:45:13,614 --> 01:45:19,839
<i>Oh, how bright the path
grows from day to day,</i>

1518
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:26,605
<i>Leaning on the everlasting arms.</i>

1519
01:45:27,613 --> 01:45:33,959
<i>Leaning, leaning,</i>

1520
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:40,509
<i>Safe and secure from all alarms.</i>

1521
01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:46,574
<i>Leaning, leaning,</i>

1522
01:45:46,575 --> 01:45:55,075
<i>I'm leaning on the everlasting arms.</i>

1523
