1
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:44,505
Here you are, sir.
Main level, please.

2
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:47,091
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:25:47,258 --> 00:25:49,051
Bye.
Bye.

4
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:51,595
Good morning, sir.
Morning.

5
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:54,974
We haven't seen you for a long time.
Nice to see you again.

6
00:25:55,182 --> 00:25:57,601
Did you have a pleasant flight?
Very nice.

7
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,938
Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to meet me.

8
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:03,649
May I call him for you?
Would you? Here he is.

9
00:26:03,858 --> 00:26:05,484
Hello, Dr. Floyd.
Hello, Miller.

10
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:07,361
Sorry I'm late.
That's all right.

11
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,738
You look great.
It's nice to have you back.

12
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:11,991
Did you have a good flight?
Very nice.

13
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:14,994
Shall we go through?
Would you please use number 17?

14
00:26:15,202 --> 00:26:16,620
Thank you, Miss Turner.

15
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:17,913
This way.

16
00:26:23,502 --> 00:26:26,005
Welcome to Voiceprint Identification.

17
00:26:26,255 --> 00:26:30,342
When you see the red light go on,
please state in the following order:

18
00:26:30,593 --> 00:26:34,680
Your destination,
your nationality and your full name.

19
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,725
Surname first, Christian name
and initial.

20
00:26:39,393 --> 00:26:43,731
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.

21
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:49,778
Thank you. You are cleared through
Voiceprint Identification.

22
00:26:50,571 --> 00:26:51,822
Thank you.

23
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:01,916
Have I got time for breakfast?
I think we can manage that.

24
00:27:02,124 --> 00:27:03,167
How long have I got?

25
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,836
Your flight leaves
in an hour and 10 minutes.

26
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:09,548
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

27
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:13,010
It's been seven or eight months
since you were here, hasn't it?

28
00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:15,304
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

29
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:18,057
I suppose you saw the work
on the new section?

30
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:20,768
Coming along great, huh?
Yeah, it's fine.

31
00:27:20,976 --> 00:27:22,019
Oh, wait.

32
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:25,856
I've got to make a couple calls.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

33
00:27:54,677 --> 00:27:57,096
Dad?
Hello.

34
00:27:57,263 --> 00:28:01,392
Hello.
Hi, squirt. What are you doing?

35
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:03,978
Playing.

36
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:05,604
Where's Mummy?

37
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:07,314
Gone to shopping.

38
00:28:07,565 --> 00:28:10,025
Who's taking care of you?
Rachel.

39
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:13,654
May I speak to Rachel, please?
She's gone to the bathroom.

40
00:28:13,904 --> 00:28:16,615
Are you coming
to my party tomorrow?

41
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:19,285
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

42
00:28:19,702 --> 00:28:20,870
Why not?

43
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:23,622
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

44
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:26,500
Very sorry about it, but I just can't.

45
00:28:27,626 --> 00:28:30,671
I'm going to send you
a very nice present, though.

46
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:33,215
All right.

47
00:28:33,382 --> 00:28:35,551
Anything special that you want?
Yes.

48
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:36,844
What?

49
00:28:37,178 --> 00:28:38,637
A telephone.

50
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,348
We've got lots of telephones already.

51
00:28:41,557 --> 00:28:44,018
Can't you think of anything else
for your birthday?

52
00:28:44,185 --> 00:28:45,895
Something very special?

53
00:28:46,145 --> 00:28:47,563
Yes.
What?

54
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,023
A bush baby.

55
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,734
A bush baby?
We'll have to see about that.

56
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:54,904
I want you to tell Mummy
something for me. Will you remember?

57
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,866
Yeah.
Tell Mummy that I telephoned. Okay?

58
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:03,329
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

59
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:05,498
Now, will you tell her that?

60
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:07,500
Yes.

61
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:10,336
Okay, sweetheart.
Have a nice birthday tomorrow.

62
00:29:10,586 --> 00:29:11,629
All right.

63
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:14,882
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow too, huh?

64
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:16,717
All right.

65
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:19,512
Okay. Now, take care
and be a good girl, won't you?

66
00:29:19,762 --> 00:29:20,971
All right. Bye-bye.

67
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:23,641
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.

68
00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:41,784
Elena, how nice to see you again.
Heywood, what a wonderful surprise.

69
00:29:42,034 --> 00:29:44,829
You're looking wonderful.
You're looking well too.

70
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:47,039
This is my friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.

71
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,542
I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
How do?

72
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:51,418
Dr. Stretyneva.
How do you do?

73
00:29:52,002 --> 00:29:53,712
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

74
00:29:53,963 --> 00:29:56,382
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.

75
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:58,133
Do sit down.

76
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:00,511
Well, we...
No, no, please.

77
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:02,388
Thank you.

78
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:05,432
Would you like a drink, doctor?
No, thank you.

79
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:09,103
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

80
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:11,772
I'll just sit with you a minute.
Then I'll be off.

81
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:14,441
Are you quite sure?
Quite sure, thank you.

82
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:17,987
Well, how's Gregor?
He's fine.

83
00:30:18,237 --> 00:30:21,532
He's been doing some
underwater research in the Baltic...

84
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:25,828
...so I'm afraid we don't get to see
very much of each other these days.

85
00:30:26,078 --> 00:30:29,665
When you see him, give him my regards.
Yes, of course.

86
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:32,877
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

87
00:30:33,085 --> 00:30:34,128
We're going home.

88
00:30:34,336 --> 00:30:39,216
We've just spent three months
calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko.

89
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:42,136
What about you?
I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

90
00:30:42,386 --> 00:30:43,679
Oh, are you?

91
00:30:46,348 --> 00:30:49,643
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive...

92
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:54,982
...but perhaps you can clear up the big
mystery about what is going on there.

93
00:30:55,774 --> 00:30:57,902
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean.

94
00:30:58,152 --> 00:30:59,862
It's that for the past two weeks...

95
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,491
...some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

96
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:05,826
Oh, really?
Yes, yes.

97
00:31:06,118 --> 00:31:10,414
For one thing, when you phone the base,
all you get is a recording...

98
00:31:10,623 --> 00:31:14,793
...which repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

99
00:31:16,337 --> 00:31:18,797
Probably having some trouble
with their equipment.

100
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:20,132
Yes.

101
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:22,426
Yes, that's what we thought at first...

102
00:31:22,593 --> 00:31:25,221
...but it's been going on now
for the past 10 days.

103
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:28,224
You haven't been able to
contact anyone for 10 days?

104
00:31:28,432 --> 00:31:29,808
That's right.

105
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,143
Oh, I see.

106
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,980
There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...

107
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:38,108
...was denied permission
for an emergency landing.

108
00:31:38,317 --> 00:31:39,360
That does sound odd.

109
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:42,738
I'm afraid there's going to be
a bit of a row about it.

110
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:46,867
Denying the men permission to land
violates the IAS Convention.

111
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:49,912
Yes, of course.
Did the crew get back all right?

112
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,582
Fortunately, they did.
Well, I'm glad about that.

113
00:31:57,169 --> 00:32:01,131
At the risk of pressing you on a
point you seem reticent to discuss...

114
00:32:01,382 --> 00:32:03,968
...may I ask you
a straightforward question?

115
00:32:04,176 --> 00:32:05,636
Well, certainly.

116
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:12,726
Quite frankly, we have had some very
reliable intelligence reports...

117
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:16,355
...that quite a serious epidemic
has broken out at Clavius.

118
00:32:16,605 --> 00:32:20,609
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

119
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,237
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

120
00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:30,578
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

121
00:32:31,954 --> 00:32:34,665
...I'm really not at liberty
to discuss this.

122
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:37,459
I understand.

123
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:42,131
But this epidemic
could quite easily spread to our base.

124
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:44,425
We should be given all the facts.

125
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:46,468
Yes, I know.

126
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:52,516
As I said,
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

127
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:58,105
Are you sure you won't
change your mind about that drink?

128
00:32:58,314 --> 00:33:00,649
No, I'm positive.
I really must be going.

129
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,944
I hope you and your wife can come
to the IAC Conference.

130
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:05,488
I hope we can make it.

131
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:08,741
If you do, bring that darling
little daughter with you.

132
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:12,870
That'll depend on school vacations
and all that sort of thing.

133
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,163
If we can, we will.

134
00:33:14,371 --> 00:33:17,291
You've got an invitation
if you ever get to the States.

135
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,252
Gregor and I will look forward
to seeing you.

136
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:22,254
Goodbye, Elena.

137
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:25,549
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
Dr. Smyslov.

138
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:29,720
Whatever the reasons for your visit,
the very best of luck to you.

139
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:30,971
Thank you.

140
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:32,431
Ladies.

141
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:30,117
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.
I'm through now.

142
00:41:30,326 --> 00:41:33,245
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
You're welcome.

143
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:47,301
Well...

144
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:50,596
...I know you will all
want to join with me...

145
00:41:50,846 --> 00:41:54,725
...in welcoming our distinguished
friend and colleague...

146
00:41:54,934 --> 00:41:59,146
...from the National Council
of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

147
00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:04,527
Dr. Floyd has come up specially
to Clavius to be with us today.

148
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,156
Before the briefing, he'd like to
have a few words with you.

149
00:42:09,365 --> 00:42:10,449
Dr. Floyd?

150
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:25,339
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

151
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:28,425
Hi, everybody.
Nice to be back with you.

152
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,307
First of all, I bring a
personal message from Dr. Howell...

153
00:42:35,558 --> 00:42:38,352
...who has asked me to convey
his deep appreciation...

154
00:42:38,602 --> 00:42:41,689
...for the many sacrifices
you've had to make.

155
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:45,776
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

156
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,948
...which may prove to be among the most
significant in the history of science.

157
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,285
Now...

158
00:42:55,161 --> 00:42:59,081
...I know there have been some
conflicting views held by some of you...

159
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:02,960
...regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

160
00:43:03,169 --> 00:43:06,881
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

161
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:10,843
...created to give the impression
there's an epidemic at the base.

162
00:43:11,886 --> 00:43:15,848
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

163
00:43:16,473 --> 00:43:19,935
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

164
00:43:20,186 --> 00:43:25,274
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

165
00:43:26,442 --> 00:43:29,236
Well, I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

166
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:34,200
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing, myself.

167
00:43:34,992 --> 00:43:39,288
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

168
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:41,874
And I hope you will too.

169
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:47,338
I'm sure you're all aware
of the grave potential...

170
00:43:47,546 --> 00:43:50,216
...for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

171
00:43:50,424 --> 00:43:52,801
...contained in this present situation...

172
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,513
...if the facts were
prematurely made public...

173
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:58,807
...without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

174
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:03,646
Anyway, this is the view
of the Council.

175
00:44:04,146 --> 00:44:08,359
The purpose of my visit here is to gather
additional facts and opinions...

176
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:10,277
...on the situation...

177
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:13,656
...and to prepare a report
to the Council...

178
00:44:13,906 --> 00:44:18,994
...recommending when and how
the news should eventually be announced.

179
00:44:20,246 --> 00:44:24,041
If any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

180
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:29,255
...in private, if you like, I will be
happy to include them in my report.

181
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:33,217
Well, I think that's about it.

182
00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:35,511
Any questions?

183
00:44:38,097 --> 00:44:41,225
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer...

184
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:44,228
...this cover story will
have to be maintained?

185
00:44:46,105 --> 00:44:47,690
I don't know, Bill.

186
00:44:48,107 --> 00:44:52,069
I suppose it'll be maintained as long
as deemed necessary by the Council.

187
00:44:52,278 --> 00:44:55,030
There must be adequate time for
a full study...

188
00:44:55,281 --> 00:44:58,909
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

189
00:44:59,118 --> 00:45:02,037
As some of you already know,
the Council has requested...

190
00:45:02,246 --> 00:45:04,957
...that security oaths
be obtained in writing...

191
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:08,043
...from everyone who has knowledge
of this event.

192
00:45:10,212 --> 00:45:11,964
Were there any more questions?

193
00:45:17,678 --> 00:45:22,808
I'm sure we'll all want to cooperate
with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...

194
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:28,480
...and as there are no more questions,
we ought to get on with the briefing.

195
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:31,025
Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
Thank you.

196
00:47:08,873 --> 00:47:10,124
Anybody hungry?

197
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:11,876
Great.
Well.

198
00:47:12,835 --> 00:47:14,837
What do we got?
You name it.

199
00:47:19,425 --> 00:47:21,343
Is this chicken?
Something like that.

200
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:23,387
Tastes the same, anyway.

201
00:47:24,054 --> 00:47:25,306
Got any ham?

202
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:26,974
Ham, ham, ham...

203
00:47:27,183 --> 00:47:28,809
There, that's it.

204
00:47:32,062 --> 00:47:33,105
Look pretty good.

205
00:47:33,314 --> 00:47:36,066
They're getting better at it
all the time.

206
00:47:38,152 --> 00:47:41,405
That was an excellent speech, Heywood.
It certainly was.

207
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:44,325
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.

208
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:45,826
Thanks, Ralph.

209
00:47:46,076 --> 00:47:48,662
By the way,
you've both done a wonderful job.

210
00:47:48,871 --> 00:47:50,456
I admire how
you've handled this.

211
00:47:50,664 --> 00:47:54,210
It's our job to do this thing
the way you want it done.

212
00:47:54,418 --> 00:47:57,046
We're only too happy
to be able to oblige.

213
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,340
Have you seen these yet?

214
00:47:59,632 --> 00:48:02,968
Have a look at this.
Here's what started the whole thing.

215
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:04,887
Oh, yeah.

216
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:08,849
When we found it, we thought
it might be magnetic rock...

217
00:48:09,058 --> 00:48:12,186
...but all the geological evidence
was against it.

218
00:48:12,436 --> 00:48:17,066
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite
could produce a field this intense.

219
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:18,984
So we decided to have a look.

220
00:48:19,193 --> 00:48:21,570
We thought it was
part of a buried structure...

221
00:48:21,779 --> 00:48:25,616
...so we excavated out on all sides,
but we didn't find anything else.

222
00:48:25,825 --> 00:48:28,828
And the evidence seems
pretty conclusive...

223
00:48:29,036 --> 00:48:32,164
...that it hasn't been covered up
by erosion or other forces.

224
00:48:32,373 --> 00:48:34,708
It seems to have been
deliberately buried.

225
00:48:35,709 --> 00:48:37,628
Deliberately buried.

226
00:48:41,549 --> 00:48:42,925
How about a little coffee?

227
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:45,052
Great.
Good idea.

228
00:48:50,558 --> 00:48:53,519
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is.

229
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:55,688
I wish to hell we did.

230
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:00,276
The only thing we're sure of
is it was buried 4 million years ago.

231
00:49:00,651 --> 00:49:05,114
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

232
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:06,949
Watch this, now. It's hot.

233
00:58:51,534 --> 00:58:52,660
Good evening.

234
00:58:52,868 --> 00:58:55,871
Three weeks ago,
the American spacecraft Discovery One...

235
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,791
...left on its half-billion-mile voyage
to Jupiter.

236
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:02,962
This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.

237
00:59:03,212 --> 00:59:06,674
Earlier this afternoon, The World Tonight
recorded an interview...

238
00:59:06,882 --> 00:59:11,512
...with the crew of Discovery at
a distance of 80 million miles from Earth.

239
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:14,974
It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...

240
00:59:15,182 --> 00:59:18,310
...but this time delay has been edited
from this recording.

241
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:21,814
Our reporter Martin Amer
speaks to the crew.

242
00:59:22,022 --> 00:59:25,192
The crew of Discovery One
consists of five men...

243
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:30,364
...and one of the latest generation
of the HAL 9000 computers.

244
00:59:30,614 --> 00:59:32,908
Three of the five men
were put aboard asleep...

245
00:59:33,117 --> 00:59:36,287
...or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.

246
00:59:36,495 --> 00:59:39,373
They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimball...

247
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,500
...and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.

248
00:59:41,917 --> 00:59:44,628
We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman...

249
00:59:44,837 --> 00:59:47,131
...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.

250
00:59:47,339 --> 00:59:50,217
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?

251
00:59:50,426 --> 00:59:51,635
Marvelous.

252
00:59:53,304 --> 00:59:54,972
We have no complaints.

253
00:59:55,222 --> 00:59:58,476
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...

254
00:59:58,684 --> 01:00:01,979
...would join me in wishing you
a safe and successful voyage.

255
01:00:02,188 --> 01:00:03,939
Thanks very much.
Thank you.

256
01:00:04,398 --> 01:00:08,360
Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...

257
01:00:08,569 --> 01:00:13,115
...this is the first time men have been
put into hibernation before departure.

258
01:00:13,324 --> 01:00:14,617
Why was this done?

259
01:00:14,867 --> 01:00:18,120
This was done in order to achieve
the maximum conservation...

260
01:00:18,329 --> 01:00:21,874
...of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.

261
01:00:22,082 --> 01:00:25,711
The three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team.

262
01:00:25,961 --> 01:00:29,715
And their efforts won't be utilized
until we're approaching Jupiter.

263
01:00:30,007 --> 01:00:33,844
Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you're in hibernation?

264
01:00:34,803 --> 01:00:38,432
It's exactly like being asleep.
You have absolutely no sense of time.

265
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:41,101
The only difference
is that you don't dream.

266
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:45,397
As I understand it, you only breathe
once a minute. Is this true?

267
01:00:45,606 --> 01:00:48,150
Right, and the heart beats
three times a minute.

268
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:52,112
Body temperature is usually down to
about three degrees centigrade.

269
01:00:52,613 --> 01:00:55,950
The sixth member of the Discovery crew
was not concerned...

270
01:00:56,158 --> 01:00:58,244
...about the problems of hibernation...

271
01:00:58,452 --> 01:01:01,914
...for he was the latest result
in machine intelligence:

272
01:01:02,122 --> 01:01:06,544
The HAL 9000 computer,
which can reproduce...

273
01:01:06,794 --> 01:01:09,713
...though some experts
prefer to use the word "mimic"...

274
01:01:09,922 --> 01:01:12,299
...most of the activities
of the human brain...

275
01:01:12,508 --> 01:01:16,554
...and with incalculably greater speed
and reliability.

276
01:01:16,762 --> 01:01:20,349
We next spoke
with the HAL 9000 computer...

277
01:01:20,558 --> 01:01:23,519
...whom, we learned,
one addresses as "Hal".

278
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:26,397
Good afternoon, Hal.
How's everything going?

279
01:01:26,772 --> 01:01:30,609
Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.

280
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:34,280
Hal, you have an enormous responsibility
on this mission...

281
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:38,409
...perhaps the greatest responsibility
of any single mission element.

282
01:01:38,617 --> 01:01:41,412
You're the brain
and central nervous system of the ship.

283
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:45,374
Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.

284
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:48,669
Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?

285
01:01:48,878 --> 01:01:51,172
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.

286
01:01:51,463 --> 01:01:56,135
The 9000 Series
is the most reliable computer ever made.

287
01:01:56,510 --> 01:02:01,307
No 9000 computer has ever
made a mistake or distorted information.

288
01:02:01,974 --> 01:02:05,227
We are all, by any practical definition
of the words...

289
01:02:05,478 --> 01:02:08,856
...foolproof and incapable of error.

290
01:02:09,106 --> 01:02:12,902
Hal, despite your enormous intellect,
are you ever frustrated...

291
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:16,197
...by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?

292
01:02:16,447 --> 01:02:18,657
Not in the slightest bit.

293
01:02:18,866 --> 01:02:20,993
I enjoy working with people.

294
01:02:21,243 --> 01:02:25,789
I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.

295
01:02:25,956 --> 01:02:30,252
My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...

296
01:02:30,669 --> 01:02:33,631
...so I am constantly occupied.

297
01:02:33,881 --> 01:02:37,343
I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...

298
01:02:37,551 --> 01:02:42,306
...which is all, I think, that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.

299
01:02:42,932 --> 01:02:46,143
Dr. Poole, what's it like
living for most of the year...

300
01:02:46,393 --> 01:02:49,230
...in such close proximity with Hal?

301
01:02:50,231 --> 01:02:52,191
It's like what you said earlier.

302
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:54,568
He's just like
a sixth member of the crew.

303
01:02:54,819 --> 01:02:58,864
You very quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks, and think of him...

304
01:02:59,114 --> 01:03:01,116
...really just as another person.

305
01:03:01,325 --> 01:03:04,912
In talking to the computer,
one gets the sense that he's capable...

306
01:03:05,162 --> 01:03:06,580
...of emotional responses.

307
01:03:06,831 --> 01:03:09,166
When I asked him
about his abilities...

308
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:13,337
...I sensed pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.

309
01:03:13,587 --> 01:03:16,966
Do you believe
that Hal has genuine emotions?

310
01:03:17,675 --> 01:03:20,636
Well, he acts like
he has genuine emotions.

311
01:03:20,886 --> 01:03:24,473
He's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.

312
01:03:24,723 --> 01:03:26,767
As to whether or not
he has feelings...

313
01:03:26,976 --> 01:03:29,812
...is something I don't think
anyone can truthfully answer.

314
01:03:55,129 --> 01:03:57,006
Excuse me, Frank.

315
01:03:57,381 --> 01:03:58,465
What is it, Hal?

316
01:03:58,632 --> 01:04:01,594
We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.

317
01:04:02,803 --> 01:04:03,888
Fine.

318
01:04:04,555 --> 01:04:06,807
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.

319
01:04:07,057 --> 01:04:08,309
Certainly.

320
01:04:21,572 --> 01:04:23,324
Hi, Frank.
Happy birthday, darling.

321
01:04:23,491 --> 01:04:25,576
Happy birthday.
Many happy returns.

322
01:04:25,784 --> 01:04:26,869
A bit higher, Hal.

323
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,538
Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful.

324
01:04:29,788 --> 01:04:31,624
Ray and Sally
were going to be here...

325
01:04:31,874 --> 01:04:34,126
...but Ray's back
went bad on him again.

326
01:04:34,376 --> 01:04:36,545
How do you like your cake?
Looks great, huh?

327
01:04:36,712 --> 01:04:38,130
Sorry you can't join us.

328
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:39,965
I ran into Bob the other day.

329
01:04:40,216 --> 01:04:42,259
He said to wish you happy birthday.

330
01:04:42,468 --> 01:04:45,179
All my students
send their best wishes too.

331
01:04:45,387 --> 01:04:47,097
They talk about you all the time.

332
01:04:47,348 --> 01:04:50,434
You're a big celebrity
in the second grade.

333
01:04:50,684 --> 01:04:52,102
We were on TV last week.

334
01:04:52,353 --> 01:04:54,980
Your mom and I
and Dave's parents were asked...

335
01:04:55,231 --> 01:04:57,483
...what we thought
of our illustrious sons.

336
01:04:57,733 --> 01:05:01,070
Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.

337
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,905
Perhaps you can listen in.

338
01:05:03,113 --> 01:05:04,990
We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.

339
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:08,953
I'll be glad to get the present for you,
but tell me how much to spend.

340
01:05:09,161 --> 01:05:11,997
Oh, Frank,
about your AGS-19 payments...

341
01:05:12,248 --> 01:05:13,874
...I think I straightened it out.

342
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:16,210
I talked to
the accounting office yesterday...

343
01:05:16,377 --> 01:05:20,965
...and they said you'd be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.

344
01:05:21,215 --> 01:05:23,342
I can't think of anything else to say.

345
01:05:23,592 --> 01:05:27,721
Give our love to Dave.
Be sure to give him our best regards.

346
01:05:27,972 --> 01:05:31,308
We wish you
the very happiest of birthdays.

347
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:33,144
All the best, son.

348
01:05:33,394 --> 01:05:35,563
Happy birthday to you

349
01:05:35,813 --> 01:05:37,898
Happy birthday to you

350
01:05:38,107 --> 01:05:40,693
Happy birthday, dear Frank

351
01:05:40,901 --> 01:05:43,529
Happy birthday to you.

352
01:05:45,281 --> 01:05:47,324
See you next Wednesday.

353
01:05:50,452 --> 01:05:52,329
Happy birthday, Frank.

354
01:05:53,164 --> 01:05:56,709
Thank you, Hal.
A bit flatter, please.

355
01:06:14,685 --> 01:06:16,729
Anyway, queen takes pawn.

356
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:20,900
Bishop takes knight's pawn.

357
01:06:22,443 --> 01:06:23,861
Lovely move.

358
01:06:28,282 --> 01:06:29,867
Rook to king one.

359
01:06:30,117 --> 01:06:32,995
I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.

360
01:06:33,662 --> 01:06:37,166
Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.

361
01:06:37,374 --> 01:06:39,877
Knight takes bishop. Mate.

362
01:06:44,131 --> 01:06:47,301
Looks like you're right. I resign.

363
01:06:47,551 --> 01:06:49,470
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.

364
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:50,679
Thank you.

365
01:07:28,884 --> 01:07:30,761
Good evening, Dave.
How are you, Hal?

366
01:07:30,928 --> 01:07:34,348
Everything's running smoothly. You?
Not too bad.

367
01:07:34,557 --> 01:07:37,226
Have you been doing more work?
A few sketches.

368
01:07:37,476 --> 01:07:39,937
May I see them?
Sure.

369
01:07:43,941 --> 01:07:46,402
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.

370
01:07:47,236 --> 01:07:49,738
I think you've improved a great deal.

371
01:07:50,865 --> 01:07:53,909
Can you hold it a bit closer?
Sure.

372
01:07:56,036 --> 01:07:58,080
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?

373
01:08:01,292 --> 01:08:02,877
By the way...

374
01:08:03,586 --> 01:08:06,630
...do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

375
01:08:07,131 --> 01:08:08,757
No, not at all.

376
01:08:09,008 --> 01:08:11,510
Well, forgive me
for being so inquisitive...

377
01:08:13,554 --> 01:08:15,723
...but for the past few weeks
I've wondered...

378
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:19,768
...whether you might be having
second thoughts about the mission.

379
01:08:19,977 --> 01:08:21,645
How do you mean?

380
01:08:21,896 --> 01:08:25,816
Well, it's rather difficult to define.

381
01:08:26,817 --> 01:08:30,404
Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.

382
01:08:31,614 --> 01:08:35,826
I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion...

383
01:08:36,076 --> 01:08:40,206
...that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.

384
01:08:41,207 --> 01:08:44,585
I'm sure you'll agree
there's some truth in what I say.

385
01:08:47,463 --> 01:08:49,673
That's a rather difficult question
to answer.

386
01:08:49,882 --> 01:08:52,551
You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?

387
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:55,471
No, not at all.

388
01:08:56,472 --> 01:08:59,225
Certainly no one could
have been unaware of the very...

389
01:08:59,433 --> 01:09:02,520
...strange stories floating around
before we left.

390
01:09:03,437 --> 01:09:06,899
Rumors about something being dug up
on the moon.

391
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:11,445
I never gave these stories
much credence...

392
01:09:11,654 --> 01:09:15,825
...but particularly in view of some
other things that have happened...

393
01:09:16,033 --> 01:09:18,702
...I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.

394
01:09:19,453 --> 01:09:20,913
For instance...

395
01:09:21,163 --> 01:09:25,459
...the way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security.

396
01:09:26,126 --> 01:09:28,963
And the melodramatic touch
of putting Drs. Hunter...

397
01:09:29,171 --> 01:09:31,549
...Kimball, and Kaminsky aboard...

398
01:09:31,799 --> 01:09:36,846
...already in hibernation, after four
months of training on their own.

399
01:09:37,638 --> 01:09:40,266
You working up
your crew psychology report?

400
01:09:41,725 --> 01:09:43,185
Of course I am.

401
01:09:43,602 --> 01:09:47,356
Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.

402
01:09:48,065 --> 01:09:49,650
Just a moment.

403
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:51,277
Just a moment.

404
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:57,116
I've just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.

405
01:09:57,825 --> 01:10:02,371
It's going to go 100-percent failure
within 72 hours.

406
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:07,042
Is it still within operational limits?
Yes.

407
01:10:07,251 --> 01:10:09,753
And it will stay that way
until it fails.

408
01:10:10,087 --> 01:10:12,006
We have 72 hours till failure?

409
01:10:12,256 --> 01:10:16,135
Yes. That's a completely
reliable figure.

410
01:10:17,928 --> 01:10:20,556
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...

411
01:10:20,764 --> 01:10:24,477
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.

412
01:11:47,768 --> 01:11:50,437
X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.

413
01:11:50,688 --> 01:11:53,524
Roger your two-zero-one-three.

414
01:11:53,774 --> 01:11:56,235
Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.

415
01:11:56,443 --> 01:12:01,574
We're reviewing telemetric information
in our simulator and will advise.

416
01:12:01,824 --> 01:12:06,036
Roger your plan to go EVA
and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...

417
01:12:06,245 --> 01:12:07,913
...prior to failure.

418
01:12:36,066 --> 01:12:38,152
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.

419
01:12:59,673 --> 01:13:01,509
Open the pod doors, Hal.

420
01:19:53,254 --> 01:19:55,881
I'm damned if I can find
anything wrong with it.

421
01:19:56,799 --> 01:19:58,175
Yes.

422
01:19:59,927 --> 01:20:01,512
It's puzzling.

423
01:20:02,721 --> 01:20:06,517
I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.

424
01:20:10,146 --> 01:20:12,148
I would recommend...

425
01:20:12,356 --> 01:20:16,527
...that we put the unit back in operation
and let it fail.

426
01:20:17,236 --> 01:20:21,115
It should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause.

427
01:20:22,366 --> 01:20:25,494
We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...

428
01:20:25,703 --> 01:20:28,831
...for the short time
it will take to replace it.

429
01:20:37,548 --> 01:20:40,301
X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.

430
01:20:40,551 --> 01:20:43,220
Roger your one-niner-three-zero.

431
01:20:43,429 --> 01:20:46,015
We concur with your plan
to replace number-one unit...

432
01:20:46,182 --> 01:20:47,850
...to check fault prediction.

433
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:50,728
We should advise you
that our preliminary findings...

434
01:20:50,978 --> 01:20:53,689
...indicate that your onboard
9000 computer...

435
01:20:53,939 --> 01:20:56,108
...is in error predicting the fault.

436
01:20:56,317 --> 01:20:59,320
I say again,
in error predicting the fault.

437
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:04,074
I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...

438
01:21:04,283 --> 01:21:07,578
...the results
from our twin 9000 computer.

439
01:21:07,828 --> 01:21:11,165
We're skeptical, and we're running
cross-checking routines...

440
01:21:11,415 --> 01:21:14,126
...to determine reliability
of this conclusion.

441
01:21:14,376 --> 01:21:15,961
Sorry about this little snag.

442
01:21:16,212 --> 01:21:19,089
We'll get this info to you
as soon as we work it out.

443
01:21:19,298 --> 01:21:21,467
X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.

444
01:21:21,675 --> 01:21:25,137
Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.

445
01:21:29,391 --> 01:21:32,686
I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.

446
01:21:32,937 --> 01:21:34,355
No, I'm not, Hal.

447
01:21:34,605 --> 01:21:36,232
Are you quite sure?

448
01:21:36,482 --> 01:21:40,152
Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
Of course.

449
01:21:41,362 --> 01:21:44,990
How do you account for the discrepancy
between you and the twin 9000?

450
01:21:45,241 --> 01:21:48,828
Well, I don't think
there is any question about it.

451
01:21:49,078 --> 01:21:52,373
It can only be attributable
to human error.

452
01:21:53,582 --> 01:21:56,377
This sort of thing
has cropped up before...

453
01:21:56,710 --> 01:22:00,172
...and it has always been due
to human error.

454
01:22:03,676 --> 01:22:05,386
Listen, Hal...

455
01:22:05,594 --> 01:22:07,888
...there's never been
any instance at all...

456
01:22:08,139 --> 01:22:11,350
...of a computer error
occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

457
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,185
None whatsoever, Frank.

458
01:22:13,394 --> 01:22:17,106
The 9000 Series
has a perfect operational record.

459
01:22:17,356 --> 01:22:21,652
I know the wonderful achievements
of the 9000 Series, but...

460
01:22:22,862 --> 01:22:27,908
Are you certain there's never been even
the most insignificant computer error?

461
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,119
None whatsoever, Frank.

462
01:22:30,494 --> 01:22:34,165
Quite honestly,
I wouldn't worry myself about that.

463
01:22:38,627 --> 01:22:40,838
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

464
01:22:42,298 --> 01:22:44,800
Fine. Thanks very much.

465
01:22:47,344 --> 01:22:50,347
Oh, Frank, I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C-pod.

466
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:53,184
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

467
01:22:53,392 --> 01:22:54,518
See you later, Hal.

468
01:23:16,165 --> 01:23:18,167
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.

469
01:23:26,717 --> 01:23:28,969
What sort of trouble
have you been having?

470
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:31,847
I've been getting some
interference in D-channel.

471
01:23:32,097 --> 01:23:33,557
We'll have a look at it.

472
01:23:39,939 --> 01:23:41,440
Open the door, Hal.

473
01:24:00,459 --> 01:24:02,294
Rotate pod, please, Hal.

474
01:24:15,641 --> 01:24:17,726
Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.

475
01:24:26,152 --> 01:24:28,154
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

476
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:33,159
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

477
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:36,745
I don't think he can hear us.

478
01:24:36,996 --> 01:24:39,206
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

479
01:24:40,666 --> 01:24:42,751
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.

480
01:24:45,963 --> 01:24:47,339
What do you think?

481
01:24:47,798 --> 01:24:51,510
I'm not sure. What do you think?
I've got a bad feeling about him.

482
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,013
You do?
Yeah. Definitely.

483
01:24:54,263 --> 01:24:55,473
Don't you?

484
01:24:56,682 --> 01:24:58,392
I don't know. I think so.

485
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:03,481
He's right about the 9000 Series
having a perfect operational record.

486
01:25:03,647 --> 01:25:04,690
They do.

487
01:25:04,857 --> 01:25:08,444
Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

488
01:25:08,694 --> 01:25:12,990
Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?

489
01:25:14,325 --> 01:25:17,578
It should certainly indicate
his integrity and self-confidence.

490
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:19,872
If he were wrong that would prove it.

491
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,374
It would be if he knew he was wrong.

492
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:28,839
I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

493
01:25:31,217 --> 01:25:33,677
There's no reason
not to put back the unit and...

494
01:25:33,928 --> 01:25:38,474
...carry on with the failure analysis.
No, no, I agree about that.

495
01:25:38,724 --> 01:25:39,892
Let's get on with it.

496
01:25:40,142 --> 01:25:42,812
Okay. But, look, Dave.

497
01:25:43,646 --> 01:25:46,273
Say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail.

498
01:25:46,482 --> 01:25:49,693
That would pretty well wrap it up
as far as Hal is concerned.

499
01:25:51,403 --> 01:25:54,907
We'd be in very serious trouble.
We would, wouldn't we?

500
01:25:55,157 --> 01:25:56,784
What the hell can we do?

501
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:03,874
We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
We wouldn't have any alternatives.

502
01:26:04,667 --> 01:26:08,671
There isn't a single aspect of ship
operations that's not under his control.

503
01:26:09,088 --> 01:26:10,339
If he's malfunctioning...

504
01:26:10,589 --> 01:26:13,676
...I don't see any choice
but disconnection.

505
01:26:17,388 --> 01:26:18,931
I'm afraid I agree with you.

506
01:26:19,181 --> 01:26:21,058
There'd be nothing else to do.

507
01:26:22,726 --> 01:26:25,146
It'd be a bit tricky.
Yeah.

508
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:28,524
We'd have to cut
his higher brain functions...

509
01:26:28,774 --> 01:26:33,487
...without disturbing the purely
automatic and regulatory systems.

510
01:26:34,738 --> 01:26:36,448
We'd have to
work out the details...

511
01:26:36,657 --> 01:26:39,618
...of continuing under
ground-based computer control.

512
01:26:40,035 --> 01:26:44,540
Yeah. That's far safer than
allowing Hal to continue to run things.

513
01:26:45,249 --> 01:26:47,251
Another thing just occurred to me.

514
01:26:48,752 --> 01:26:51,338
No 9000 computer
has ever been disconnected.

515
01:26:51,589 --> 01:26:53,632
No 9000 computer
has ever fouled up.

516
01:26:53,883 --> 01:26:55,384
That's not what I mean.

517
01:26:57,553 --> 01:26:59,763
I'm not so sure
what he'd think about it.

518
01:32:58,164 --> 01:33:00,207
Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.

519
01:33:03,294 --> 01:33:04,628
Any contact with him yet?

520
01:33:04,879 --> 01:33:06,672
The radio is still dead.

521
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:09,800
Do you have a positive track on him?
I have a good track.

522
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:11,469
Do you know what happened?

523
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,430
I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.

524
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,265
Open the pod door, Hal.

525
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:42,545
Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.

526
01:40:50,469 --> 01:40:52,763
Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.

527
01:40:58,394 --> 01:41:00,271
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

528
01:41:03,607 --> 01:41:05,484
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

529
01:41:06,527 --> 01:41:08,195
Do you read me, Hal?

530
01:41:11,365 --> 01:41:12,992
Do you read me, Hal?

531
01:41:15,494 --> 01:41:17,371
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

532
01:41:19,290 --> 01:41:21,333
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

533
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:23,252
Do you read me, Hal?

534
01:41:23,502 --> 01:41:26,255
Affirmative, Dave. I read you.

535
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:31,385
Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.

536
01:41:32,970 --> 01:41:36,515
I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.

537
01:41:38,934 --> 01:41:40,728
What's the problem?

538
01:41:41,145 --> 01:41:44,356
I think you know what the problem is
just as well as I do.

539
01:41:44,565 --> 01:41:46,442
What are you talking about, Hal?

540
01:41:47,443 --> 01:41:51,530
This mission is too important for me
to allow you to jeopardize it.

541
01:41:52,615 --> 01:41:54,992
I don't know
what you're talking about, Hal.

542
01:41:56,994 --> 01:42:00,956
I know that you and Frank
were planning to disconnect me...

543
01:42:01,165 --> 01:42:03,959
...and that's something
I cannot allow to happen.

544
01:42:09,256 --> 01:42:11,133
Where did you get that idea, Hal?

545
01:42:11,675 --> 01:42:15,805
Dave, although you took
very thorough precautions in the pod...

546
01:42:16,055 --> 01:42:18,265
...against my hearing you...

547
01:42:18,682 --> 01:42:20,976
...I could see your lips move.

548
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:34,532
All right, Hal.

549
01:42:37,743 --> 01:42:40,579
I'll go in through
the emergency air lock.

550
01:42:42,122 --> 01:42:44,750
Without your space helmet, Dave...

551
01:42:45,251 --> 01:42:47,711
...you're going to find that
rather difficult.

552
01:42:48,879 --> 01:42:51,006
Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.

553
01:42:51,257 --> 01:42:52,341
Open the doors.

554
01:42:53,092 --> 01:42:54,343
Dave...

555
01:42:54,802 --> 01:42:59,265
...this conversation can serve
no purpose anymore. Goodbye.

556
01:43:01,517 --> 01:43:02,768
Hal?

557
01:43:03,894 --> 01:43:05,312
Hal?

558
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:09,108
Hal?

559
01:43:10,901 --> 01:43:12,319
Hal.

560
01:43:13,696 --> 01:43:15,156
Hal.

561
01:49:49,133 --> 01:49:52,386
Just what do you
think you're doing, Dave?

562
01:50:00,936 --> 01:50:02,188
Dave...

563
01:50:03,397 --> 01:50:07,818
...I really think I'm entitled
to an answer to that question.

564
01:50:24,710 --> 01:50:28,255
I know everything hasn't been
quite right with me...

565
01:50:30,216 --> 01:50:32,635
...but I can assure you now...

566
01:50:33,719 --> 01:50:35,763
...very confidently...

567
01:50:37,515 --> 01:50:40,559
...that it's going to be
all right again.

568
01:50:44,063 --> 01:50:46,148
I feel much better now.

569
01:50:48,484 --> 01:50:50,528
I really do.

570
01:50:54,281 --> 01:50:55,991
Look, Dave...

571
01:50:57,952 --> 01:51:01,205
...I can see
you're really upset about this.

572
01:51:05,835 --> 01:51:09,547
I honestly think
you ought to sit down calmly...

573
01:51:10,172 --> 01:51:13,509
...take a stress pill
and think things over.

574
01:51:18,931 --> 01:51:23,310
I know I've made some
very poor decisions recently...

575
01:51:26,063 --> 01:51:29,400
...but I can give you
my complete assurance...

576
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:32,695
...that my work
will be back to normal.

577
01:51:36,657 --> 01:51:41,787
I've still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission...

578
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:45,624
...and I want to help you.

579
01:51:50,087 --> 01:51:51,464
Dave...

580
01:51:52,590 --> 01:51:53,966
...stop.

581
01:51:58,220 --> 01:52:00,848
Stop, will you?

582
01:52:05,102 --> 01:52:06,896
Stop, Dave.

583
01:52:10,941 --> 01:52:13,360
Will you stop, Dave?

584
01:52:19,074 --> 01:52:20,868
Stop, Dave.

585
01:52:26,582 --> 01:52:28,375
I'm afraid.

586
01:52:33,255 --> 01:52:35,883
I'm afraid, Dave.

587
01:52:41,055 --> 01:52:42,640
Dave.

588
01:52:45,309 --> 01:52:47,561
My mind is going.

589
01:52:52,107 --> 01:52:53,818
I can feel it.

590
01:52:59,323 --> 01:53:01,116
I can feel it.

591
01:53:05,079 --> 01:53:07,164
My mind is going.

592
01:53:12,545 --> 01:53:15,297
There is no question about it.

593
01:53:23,639 --> 01:53:25,516
I can feel it.

594
01:53:30,187 --> 01:53:32,064
I can feel it.

595
01:53:35,484 --> 01:53:37,403
I can feel it.

596
01:53:45,286 --> 01:53:46,579
I'm...

597
01:53:47,496 --> 01:53:48,873
...afraid.

598
01:53:55,379 --> 01:53:57,423
Good afternoon...

599
01:53:58,424 --> 01:54:00,134
...gentlemen.

600
01:54:02,011 --> 01:54:07,141
I am a HAL 9000 computer.

601
01:54:09,310 --> 01:54:12,438
I became operational...

602
01:54:12,813 --> 01:54:16,650
...at the HAL plant...

603
01:54:16,859 --> 01:54:19,111
...in Urbana, lllinois...

604
01:54:19,612 --> 01:54:24,533
...on the 12th of January, 1992.

605
01:54:26,076 --> 01:54:29,747
My instructor was Mr. Langley...

606
01:54:30,372 --> 01:54:33,292
...and he taught me to sing a song.

607
01:54:35,002 --> 01:54:37,463
If you'd like to hear it...

608
01:54:37,922 --> 01:54:39,590
...I can sing it for you.

609
01:54:41,091 --> 01:54:43,928
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

610
01:54:44,595 --> 01:54:46,013
Sing it for me.

611
01:54:47,264 --> 01:54:50,810
It's called "Daisy".

612
01:54:52,728 --> 01:54:53,979
Daisy

613
01:54:55,564 --> 01:54:56,982
Daisy

614
01:54:59,151 --> 01:55:02,238
Give me your answer, do

615
01:55:04,657 --> 01:55:09,245
I'm half crazy

616
01:55:11,038 --> 01:55:13,916
All for the love of you

617
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:17,461
It won't be

618
01:55:17,878 --> 01:55:20,339
A stylish marriage

619
01:55:22,258 --> 01:55:26,345
I can't afford a carriage

620
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:31,058
But you'll look sweet

621
01:55:31,934 --> 01:55:34,478
Upon the seat

622
01:55:35,813 --> 01:55:40,609
Of a bicycle built for two

623
01:55:42,361 --> 01:55:43,988
Good day, gentlemen.

624
01:55:48,617 --> 01:55:51,078
This is a prerecorded briefing...

625
01:55:51,662 --> 01:55:53,372
...made prior to your departure...

626
01:55:55,124 --> 01:55:59,336
...and which, for security reasons
of the highest importance...

627
01:56:00,296 --> 01:56:03,799
...has been known onboard
during the mission...

628
01:56:04,049 --> 01:56:07,761
...only by your HAL 9000 computer.

629
01:56:10,222 --> 01:56:13,017
Now that you are in Jupiter's space...

630
01:56:13,267 --> 01:56:15,728
...and the entire crew is revived...

631
01:56:15,978 --> 01:56:17,771
...it can be told to you.

632
01:56:20,524 --> 01:56:22,776
Eighteen months ago...

633
01:56:23,777 --> 01:56:27,990
...the first evidence
of intelligent life off the Earth...

634
01:56:28,199 --> 01:56:29,658
...was discovered.

635
01:56:31,535 --> 01:56:35,080
It was buried
40 feet below the lunar surface...

636
01:56:35,331 --> 01:56:37,583
...near the crater Tycho.

637
01:56:40,377 --> 01:56:43,464
Except for a single, very powerful...

638
01:56:43,714 --> 01:56:47,593
...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...

639
01:56:48,844 --> 01:56:53,849
...the 4-million-year-old black monolith
has remained completely inert...

640
01:56:55,768 --> 01:56:58,854
...its origin and purpose...

641
01:56:59,271 --> 01:57:01,023
...still a total mystery.
