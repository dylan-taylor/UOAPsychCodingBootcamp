1
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,010
Chris, what is it?

2
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,210
I love you so much.

3
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,810
Don't you love me any more?

4
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,110
I've made progress,
and I recognise that.

5
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,210
But my wife, who I can't
even convince to come here...

6
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,210
Anything can set her off.
It could be the phone ringing,

7
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,610
something on the news,
something online, going shopping maybe.

8
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,510
A commemorative T-shirt in the window.
It just puts her right back in that place,

9
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,810
and it's like all my progress - ripped away.
And I'm right back there with her.

10
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,410
I feel totally the opposite. I see the TV
and I see the Internet and I see those T-shirts

11
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,810
and I feel nothing. The more I see the images,
the less I feel, the less I believe that it's real.

12
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:12,310
I mean, I think I'm supposed to feel
something by now. Don't you think so?

13
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,010
Linda, this is Chris Kelvin.
I'm returning your call.

14
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,410
I have two times available this week;

15
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:26,510
7am on Tuesday
or 6.15pm on Thursday.

16
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:33,510
You can leave a message if either
of those times are good for you. Thank you.

17
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,610
Well, I know that's not true.

18
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,710
Because I know you, and I know it's not true.

19
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,910
Good. I'm glad.

20
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,910
All right.

21
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,110
Let's pick this up on Wednesday.

22
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,610
Can I help you?

23
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,210
<i>We're looking for Dr Chris Kelvin.</i>

24
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,710
<i>Chris...</i>

25
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,910
<i>I can't imagine what you must be
thinking, getting a message like this.</i>

26
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:27,010
<i>I apologise if it seems melodramatic, but
you are the only person I can... I can trust...</i>

27
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,810
<i>in the situation.</i>

28
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,610
<i>I need your help.</i>

29
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,410
<i>I need you to come to Solaris, Chris.</i>

30
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,710
<i>I don't know how to describe
what we are experiencing up here.</i>

31
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,210
<i>We can't even agree amongst ourselves
what is... what is happening, or...</i>

32
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,510
<i>what to do about it.</i>

33
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:57,210
<i>I suppose the... the most obvious
solution would be to leave.</i>

34
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,410
<i>But none of us want to. That's why
you're getting this... this bizarre request.</i>

35
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,710
<i>I...</i>

36
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,910
<i>I told the crew that your
background and experiences</i>

37
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,310
<i>made you the...
the ideal candidate for this job.</i>

38
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,010
<i>Don't worry. I didn't elaborate.</i>

39
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,610
<i>But it's true.</i>

40
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,410
<i>So, anyway...</i>

41
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,410
<i>I, uh... I hope you will come to Solaris, Chris.</i>

42
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,410
<i>L- I think you need to.</i>

43
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,910
<i>You will see what I mean.</i>

44
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:46,510
<i>I wish I could be more specific
about all of this, but... you know.</i>

45
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,910
<i>People are listening.</i>

46
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:00,810
You can imagine the distress
Dr Gibarian's message caused at DBA.

47
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,610
Why not send in the security force?

48
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,310
We did. We lost contact
as they were approaching Solaris.

49
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,310
They haven't returned.

50
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,510
There must be some
sort of on-board Al system.

51
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,610
They shut it down.

52
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,110
The company was hoping to solve
this problem without involving a civilian.

53
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,810
Obviously these are extreme circumstances.

54
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,910
Some preparation is involved
but you shouldn't have any trouble.

55
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:39,510
The flight itself is fully automated.
You'll be asleep most of the trip.

56
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:47,710
We feel confident that if you board
the ship, you can negotiate their safe return.

57
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,610
Is that what everybody wants?

58
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,510
Of course.

59
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,410
Find the probability of F.

60
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,910
OK, stop. Go back.

61
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,310
Snow.

62
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,210
Kelvin, is it?

63
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,210
Yeah.

64
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,310
Kelvin. Right. Oh, man.

65
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,010
Sorry about that, Kelvin.

66
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,410
Names, you know, just...

67
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,810
For some reason. It, uh...

68
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,610
Yeah. Uh...

69
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,910
Well, uh, you wanna come in?

70
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,410
I'm fine.

71
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,610
Whose blood is that, leading to the lab?

72
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,610
Yeah. Blood.

73
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,110
How 'bout that?

74
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,410
Katarn.

75
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,610
He, um... Yeah.

76
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,810
Security forces showed up
and he just took off, and they...

77
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,510
Yeah. Put a hole in his pot.

78
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,610
What happened to Gibarian?

79
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,810
Yeah.

80
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,910
It was a suicide.

81
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,810
Who found him?

82
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,110
I found him.

83
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,710
What happened to Rhys?

84
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,510
Yeah, now, Rhys w... Huh.

85
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,910
We don't know, because the thing is,
he kind of... disappeared.

86
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,110
- Disappeared?
- Disappeared.

87
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,910
- How did he disappear?
- Exactly.

88
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,710
Don't know. We do know
that he's not on the ship, uh,

89
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,210
and that's... that's all we know.

90
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,010
Where's Dr Gordon?

91
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,810
Dr Gordon. She is in her room,

92
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,910
and, um...

93
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,510
Dr Gordon won't let you in her room.

94
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,410
Can you tell me what's happening here?

95
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,410
I could tell you what's happening,

96
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,510
but, uh...

97
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:08,310
I don't know if that'd
really tell you what's happening.

98
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,510
I just wanna talk to you.

99
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:23,310
You have to give me your word
you won't try to come in.

100
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,010
All right.

101
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,310
Well?

102
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,410
- What happened to Gibarian?
- Didn't you talk to Snow?

103
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,010
- I wanted to hear your version.
- There isn't any version.

104
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,210
He killed himself.

105
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:04,210
Why haven't you come home?
What happened here?

106
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,610
What did you find?

107
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,810
- Who are you representing?
- I'm the last effort to recover this mission,

108
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,910
before they abandon this ship
and everyone on board.

109
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,010
Until it starts happening to you,
there's really no point in discussing it.

110
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,210
Hey.

111
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,810
Hey!

112
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,210
<i>- Who else is here?
- Who else is here?</i>

113
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,210
<i>I saw a boy.</i>

114
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,110
Gibarian's son.

115
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,010
- Michael.
- How is that possible?

116
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,410
I think that's why you're here.

117
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,410
I want a formal interview with you
and Gordon. I'll need your help with her.

118
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,210
Yeah. All right.

119
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,610
Um...

120
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,110
How much sleep do you need, Kelvin?

121
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,910
- How much sleep?
- Yeah.

122
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,910
- How long can you go without sleep?
- Depends.

123
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,210
Well,

124
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,810
when you do go to sleep,

125
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,110
I find I sleep much better
with the door locked.

126
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:23,310
<i>I was with the project when it was
still with NASA, before it was sold to DBA.</i>

127
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,710
I was trained in physics.

128
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:30,510
I was sent here to assess
the economic potential of Solaris.

129
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:36,610
Whether or not it was a viable commercial
property or possible energy source.

130
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,110
I was still compiling data
when this shit started happening.

131
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,210
Did you run any tests
on the food, air, water?

132
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:51,310
I checked it 50 times. There are no signs of
contaminants or psychotropic compounds.

133
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,710
How about you? How are you doing?

134
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,510
Depression.

135
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,510
Along with bouts of hypomania
and primary insomnia.

136
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,610
Suggestions of agoraphobia,
obsessive-compulsive disorder,

137
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,010
shock, fatigue, denial...

138
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,110
- Not unusual, given the circumstances.
- I know.

139
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:22,410
All right. Now, what can you tell me
about what's happening here?

140
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:28,110
Just that I want it to stop,
but I want to stop it.

141
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:34,010
If I can stop it that means
I'm smarter than it is.

142
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,310
You know you can go home,
walk away from all of this.

143
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,610
I can guarantee it.

144
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,410
Yeah.

145
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:02,510
The thing is... Man, I would kill
to go back there. I'd... kill.

146
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,510
But Gordon?

147
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,510
Gordon happens to be Gordon, you know?

148
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,410
So, um...

149
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,710
But I'll see what I can do.

150
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,310
<i>We take off into the cosmos.</i>

151
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,910
<i>Ready for anything -
solitude, hardship, exhaustion...</i>

152
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,510
<i>death.</i>

153
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,810
<i>We're proud of ourselves.</i>

154
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:44,610
<i>But when you think about it,
our enthusiasm's a sham.</i>

155
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,810
<i>We don't want other worlds. We want mirrors.</i>

156
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,710
So, anyway... How's the spawn?

157
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,410
Oh, good, good. He cries
and shits in his pants every two hours.

158
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,410
I know the feeling.

159
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,610
When are you leaving?

160
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:57,410
- We've been postponed again.
- I didn't hear that.

161
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,510
Nobody knows yet.

162
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,110
The governments are looking for a buyer. I
wish we could tell people what's happening.

163
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,510
You can tell me. I'm a doctor.

164
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,710
Well, Doctor, as we study Solaris,

165
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:15,110
the most interesting thing is it, um...

166
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:20,010
Well, it seems to be reacting.
Almost like it knows it's being observed.

167
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,010
We can't explain it.

168
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,010
Are you listening to me? Chris?

169
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,410
- So anyway...
- So anyway. Sorry.

170
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:38,810
Go to her. Her name is Rheya. She's a bit
tricky but, um, I guess she's worthwhile.

171
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,310
Maybe she needs a shrink.

172
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,110
Don't we all?

173
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,710
Don't blow it.

174
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,410
<i>You start.</i>

175
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,710
<i>I did.</i>

176
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,610
<i>Really?</i>

177
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:50,010
All right, I'm gonna resist the impulse
to ask you about the door knob.

178
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:53,710
- Do you always resist your impulses?
- Not always.

179
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,610
<i>Try poetry.</i>

180
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,010
<i>"And death shall have no dominion."</i>

181
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,910
<i>Mm. Thomas.</i>

182
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,710
<i>It's not a very happy poem, though.</i>

183
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:18,410
<i>Well, you didn't seem
very happy when I saw you on the train.</i>

184
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,210
<i>I wasn't.</i>

185
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,010
<i>And tonight?</i>

186
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,910
<i>It's early.</i>

187
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,610
Goddammit!

188
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,610
I'm awake.

189
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,210
Yes.

190
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,810
How are you here?

191
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,110
How are you here?

192
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,810
How do you mean?

193
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:14,710
Where do you think you are?
Where do you think you are right now?

194
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,510
At home.

195
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:22,810
Where is home?

196
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,310
With you, where we live.

197
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:33,710
And do you remember being anywhere else
with me? Being together anywhere else?

198
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,710
- Our apartment.
- Describe it.

199
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,910
It's dark. It's very very dark.

200
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,310
And there are no paintings on the wall.

201
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:54,010
No pictures anywhere.

202
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:59,810
No pictures on the fridge, even,
which I always thought was a bit strange.

203
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:05,510
Do you remember
where we first saw each other?

204
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:10,510
On a train.

205
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,110
Chris...

206
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:32,410
I'm so happy to see you.

207
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,210
I love you so much.

208
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,310
Don't you love me any more?

209
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,010
I have to check out something with the crew.

210
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,910
No! No!

211
00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:00,210
- Don't leave me! Don't leave me!
- Why? Why?

212
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:05,210
- Why?
- I don't know.

213
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,410
I don't know.

214
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,510
It's OK.

215
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,310
It's OK.

216
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,910
Why are you sitting over there?

217
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,810
Can I come and sit with you?

218
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,010
Hey.

219
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:08,210
What was that?

220
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,810
Yeah.

221
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,310
How 'bout that?

222
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,610
Still workin' on that.

223
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,210
Where's your visitor?

224
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:30,110
I don't know. Stopped appearing.

225
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,310
- Who's your visitor?
- My brother.

226
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,610
Who was it?

227
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:01,610
My wife.

228
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,710
Dead?

229
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:17,110
So what was her name?

230
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:21,910
Will she come back?

231
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,110
Do you want her to?

232
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,910
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

233
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:34,210
- No, it isn't. It's crap.
- Only one way to find out.

234
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:37,710
You can submit it to someone
and see if they publish it.

235
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,310
That's not an indication of anything.

236
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:45,210
So no one else's opinion counts
except for yours?

237
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,810
- Yeah.
- That's insane.

238
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,410
- "That's" insane.
- I like it.

239
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,010
Brings out the red in my eyes.

240
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,810
So, did you show it to your father?

241
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,910
- Yeah.
- And?

242
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,610
- And he liked it.
- What'd he say?

243
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:10,910
- He said he liked it.
- Well...

244
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:16,910
He's a man who doesn't pass out
compliments very easily. That's something.

245
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,910
- What's that tell you?
- Can we talk about something else? Please?

246
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,610
All right. When do you wanna get hitched?

247
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,910
Every time I bring it up
you make a joke about it, and...

248
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,610
I know, I know. That's pathet...
I'm sorry. It's just...

249
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,810
It-it's so difficult for me.

250
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,610
Still? Is it something that I'm not doing?

251
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,010
No. No, no, no. That's not the issue at all.

252
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,010
Because, you know,
if you keep putting this off,

253
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:54,310
then in 15 or 20 years
I'm just gonna stop asking.

254
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,910
- Well, I've got ages, then.
- Mm.

255
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:04,210
So apart from the poem that you
quoted to me the night that we met...

256
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,610
The night that you were hitting on me.

257
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,910
Oh, I don't think so.
What's your favourite poem?

258
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:13,710
My favourite Dylan Thomas poem?
Well, there's the, uh...

259
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,410
Listen to this. We have, uh... There's the...

260
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,210
Well, there's the one he's most famous for,

261
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,710
which starts, um...

262
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,410
- "There was a young man from Nantucket..."
- I knew it. I just...

263
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,010
I'm not marrying you.

264
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,410
You...

265
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,010
Oh, you're marrying me.

266
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:52,910
Would we have to invite anyone else?

267
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,310
There should be witnesses.

268
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:01,410
Otherwise nobody'd believe us.

269
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:08,410
<i>When I was little I had
this imaginary friend called Mikashelli,</i>

270
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:12,610
who used to live under the wallpaper
in the corner of the room.

271
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,810
I used to go and visit. I had a very
intense relationship. I was an only child.

272
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:20,610
As you know. And, um...
that was like my sibling.

273
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:27,510
That was the person I used to have
battles with and fights with and everything.

274
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:31,910
What happened progressively
over the next few years

275
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,910
is that my mother stopped
communicating with me.

276
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:40,310
She only communicated with me as
Mikashelli, and wrote me these letters,

277
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,010
and we didn't have conversations any more.

278
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:46,310
- I mean, admittedly, she was certifiable.
- Mm-hm.

279
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:51,610
But, um, yeah, that was
a strange way to grow up.

280
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,410
You know, you're with the right man.

281
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,510
I so know that. That's what's great.

282
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,410
Cos, man...

283
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,710
Rheya...

284
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,510
It's me.

285
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:36,310
It's me.

286
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,010
I don't remember that.

287
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,510
When did you get that?

288
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,910
I got it just before I came here.

289
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,210
- Was I with you?
- No.

290
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:07,110
I don't actually remember anything.

291
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:12,410
I only remember you.

292
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,710
Have I been ill?

293
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,810
Sort of.

294
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,710
And we've been apart?

295
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,710
- Yes.
- For how long?

296
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,810
A few years.

297
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:35,110
- Were you alone?
- Yes.

298
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:39,410
Was that difficult?

299
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,910
It was easier than being with someone else.

300
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:50,010
Did you think about me?

301
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,810
Yes.

302
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:06,510
What is that, out there?

303
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,610
Solaris.

304
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,510
Oh, my God, yes.

305
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,010
I can't remember how I got here.

306
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:25,410
Did I come here with you?

307
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:31,110
- I don't know how you got here.
- What do you mean?

308
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:37,210
I woke up and you were here.

309
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,310
So I wasn't here yesterday?

310
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,510
No.

311
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:47,310
Right.

312
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:45,210
<i>Getting dressed?</i>

313
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:48,810
People will notice tonight.

314
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:51,510
If you're not there, Rheya,

315
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:55,410
people will notice.

316
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:03,210
I can put up with all of it,
you know? The mood swings, the...

317
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,310
restlessness,

318
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:10,310
<i>changing jobs every three months, all of it.</i>

319
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,910
<i>What I can't put up with
is you hiding from me.</i>

320
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:19,110
Why do you do that?

321
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:25,510
Do you wanna be here?

322
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:32,110
Cos I need help. I can't do this...
I can't "continue" to do this on my own.

323
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:37,810
<i>The idea of God
was dreamed up by man.</i>

324
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,310
<i>A silly animal with a small brain.</i>

325
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:43,610
<i>Even the limits
that we put on it are human limits.</i>

326
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:48,610
- It designs, it creates...
- No, I'm talking about a higher intelligence.

327
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:53,110
No, hold it. You're talking about
something else - a man in a white beard.

328
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,810
Ascribing human characteristics
to something that isn't human.

329
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,110
Aren't we all?

330
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:03,810
Rheya, given all the elements
of the known universe and enough time,

331
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:06,410
our existence is inevitable.

332
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:10,110
It's no more mysterious than trees or sharks.

333
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:14,610
We're a mathematical probability,
and that's all.

334
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,610
How do you explain that
of all the creatures on this planet,

335
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,510
only we are conscious of our own mortality?

336
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,010
You can't explain that.
That doesn't mean there's a God.

337
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,710
Maybe religion has been bred into us.

338
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,110
The pope is a wonderful woman...

339
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:53,210
- Excuse me.
- A nihilistic shrink. Is there a school?

340
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,410
Not yet.

341
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:57,610
You see? He's funny, at least.

342
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,210
Where you been?

343
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,910
Away from those fucking people.

344
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:29,610
<i>They're my friends.</i>

345
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:35,010
<i>Yeah.</i>

346
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:50,610
Chris, I've got to talk to you.

347
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:56,010
What's wrong?

348
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:01,110
I don't understand what's happening.

349
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:05,510
And if I do understand what's happening
then I don't think I can handle it.

350
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:08,010
What do you mean?

351
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:11,810
I mean...

352
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:15,010
I mean...

353
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:18,410
I'm not the person I remember.

354
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,910
Or at least I'm not sure I am.

355
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:28,710
I mean, l-I do remember things,
but I don't remember being there.

356
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:32,810
I don't remember experiencing those things.

357
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,510
My... I...

358
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,210
I mean, I'm really really...

359
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:43,010
really really trying to understand.

360
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,110
And-and these, uh...

361
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:50,610
These... these strange thoughts
keep coming into my head, and I...

362
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,410
I don't know where they're
coming from, and I'm scared.

363
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:56,910
Um...

364
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:01,310
And l-I don't know what's happening.
L-I don't know what's happening.

365
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,310
- What do you think's happening?
- You need rest.

366
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,110
- No...
- Take that.

367
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:11,110
You don't understand. Because
I don't think that I can live with this.

368
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:16,010
I don't understand what is happening now.

369
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:23,310
I mean, this-this-this... I remember this.
I have a memory of it. But...

370
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:28,810
<i>But I don't. I don't remember
seeing it. I don't...</i>

371
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:33,610
I don't remember being there. I...

372
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:40,710
Rheya, it's fatigue. It's fatigue.
It's brought on by stress.

373
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:44,510
It's fatigue. That's why you take this.

374
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:47,610
Right. Yeah.

375
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:51,710
No, it is. You'll be fine. I'll talk to Gordon
and Snow. We'll go back to Earth.

376
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:53,910
- Mm-hm.
- And you're gonna be fine.

377
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,710
Mm-hm.

378
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,910
Mm.

379
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,510
- I'm coming right back.
- Right.

380
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:05,510
- Are you gonna be all right here?
- Yeah. Yeah.

381
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,310
Yeah.

382
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:13,110
This door locks from the inside.

383
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,010
- Yeah.
- You'll be perfectly safe in here.

384
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,810
Yeah.

385
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:20,610
You sure you're gonna be all right?

386
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:23,910
You-you keep asking me that,
actually. Yes. Yeah.

387
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,110
I'm fine. I'm fine.

388
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,410
Stay here.

389
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:54,510
<i>I was so worried, man.</i>

390
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:59,810
About this guy. But then you show up,
and I'm even more-more worried about you.

391
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:04,410
Particularly after the first...
when you sent the first one away.

392
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,810
Yeah, you were pretty...

393
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:11,710
Pretty, uh... You deserved to be
as freaked out as you were.

394
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:17,810
She can never know anything
about that. Ever. You understand?

395
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:26,110
No, no, no, no, no.

396
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:31,610
I wonder if they can get pregnant.

397
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:34,510
<i>Where are you going?</i>

398
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,310
<i>- I can't be here.
- What?</i>

399
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,510
<i>You should have told me.</i>

400
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:43,010
- It wouldn't have made any difference.
- Really?

401
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,710
Chris, I had to!

402
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,910
Obviously I had to. You know that about me.

403
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:52,410
I had no idea you'd react like this. Listen!

404
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,910
Listen to me.

405
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:58,110
<i>What's changed?
I didn't even know you wanted one.</i>

406
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:01,810
Yeah, why would I want one?
Why would I want a child,

407
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:05,410
or anything that would
bring life into this house?!

408
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,910
- No, no, Chris. No. No.
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

409
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:12,910
Stop it! Stop it!

410
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,710
No, Chris, you don't understand.

411
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:20,310
You have to understand. I had no idea you
felt like that. I won't make it without you.

412
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,210
- Then you won't make it.
- Chris, no, please!

413
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,710
- Let go of me!
- No...

414
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:29,510
No!

415
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,510
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

416
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,610
<i>Oh, no.</i>

417
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:40,710
You wanna change Gordon's mind.
What if Gordon and your wife, right,

418
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:45,510
your very nice wife... She's nice, right?
Of course she's nice. Your wife is nice.

419
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:50,610
They get together, right?
Cos I'm thinkin'... women, right?

420
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,810
Right now we got woman and woman, right?

421
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:59,210
If we get "women", you know, together on the
same team and all that shit, what happens?

422
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:03,110
You know what happens.
All kinds of shit you can't explain happens.

423
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:05,710
Like the... But good shit, you know?

424
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:09,910
Mysterious, but good. Usually very good.
Things get solved, you know?

425
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:15,310
That's my plan, you know?
What do you... think?

426
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:20,710
I'll have to think about that.

427
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:31,110
<i>"And death shall have no dominion."</i>

428
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,210
<i>"Dead men naked, they shall be one</i>

429
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,210
<i>With the man in the wind
and the west moon. "</i>

430
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:42,010
<i>"When their bones are picked clean
and the clean bones gone,</i>

431
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:45,710
<i>They shall have stars at elbow and foot. "</i>

432
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:49,310
<i>"Though they go mad they shall be sane."</i>

433
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,110
<i>"Though they sink through the sea
they shall rise again. "</i>

434
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:56,910
<i>"Though lovers be lost love shall not."</i>

435
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:01,810
<i>"And death shall have no dominion."</i>

436
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:48,010
You found me.

437
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:54,210
I came back for you.

438
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:58,710
I came back that day.

439
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,710
I'm sorry.

440
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,610
<i>All right. Enough hypothesising.</i>

441
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,710
The visitors. Are they or are they not
made of subatomic particles?

442
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:30,910
Subatomic particles... I'm not sure.

443
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,110
What do you think?

444
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,610
I think... probably.

445
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:39,810
Stabilised by what?

446
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,210
Guess.

447
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:47,610
I don't know. Maybe... a Higgs field.

448
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,610
So...

449
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:54,710
if we created a negative Higgs field and
bombarded them with Higgs antibosons

450
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,310
they might disintegrate?

451
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,910
Maybe. You know,
it would take a lot of power.

452
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:04,210
Shut down all
the noncritical ship functions.

453
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:08,010
This is just a theory,
you know? We could be wrong.

454
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:13,110
- Let's find out.
- We'll take the findings back to Earth.

455
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,210
What if they follow us back?

456
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:20,110
What if what's happening here
happened on Earth on a mass scale?

457
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:22,610
Don't you see that as a problem?

458
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:25,510
I think it's a serious mistake
to assume it's benign.

459
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:28,810
It's driving us crazy
so it can watch us kill each other.

460
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,810
Is that really why you think they're here?

461
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:38,510
Given its resources it could have
done anything, including destroy us.

462
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:41,810
Meet me in the lab in an hour.

463
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,010
- I won't let you.
- How you gonna stop us?

464
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:49,210
- How you gonna stop me taking her back?
- Shall we pick up the other one on the way?

465
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:55,010
Shouldn't be too hard. We could
chart its course. Only take a day or so.

466
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:59,010
Chris, what's she talking about?

467
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:02,610
- Nothing.
- Her oxygen might have run out.

468
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:06,310
Maybe they don't need any.

469
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,710
Chris, what are they talking about?

470
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:11,010
You didn't tell her?

471
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:14,410
Tell me what?

472
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:18,610
Tell me what?

473
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:35,210
- You came before.
- He got rid of you.

474
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:39,610
You what?

475
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,510
I sent you away.

476
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:46,010
Into space.

477
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:49,610
Oh, my God.

478
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,110
Oh, my God.

479
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:55,910
No. Rheya...

480
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,410
Don't touch me.

481
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:04,110
Rheya, I didn't understand.

482
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:07,510
Rheya. Rheya. Hey.

483
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:11,810
- Don't.
- No. No. No. Don't.

484
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:50,910
What were you trying to
accomplish with that, exactly?

485
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,710
Kelvin...

486
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:04,410
It is a mistake to become
emotionally engaged with one of them.

487
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:07,410
You're being manipulated.

488
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:13,110
If she were ugly, you wouldn't want her
around. That's why she's not ugly.

489
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:17,210
She's a mirror that reflects part
of your mind. You provide the formula.

490
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:21,310
- She's alive.
- She is not human.

491
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:24,410
Try to understand that,
if you can understand anything.

492
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:30,310
What about your visitor? The one you're
so ready to destroy without hesitation?

493
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,810
Who is it? "What" is it?

494
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,110
Does it feel? Can it touch?

495
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:40,110
Does it speak?

496
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:46,110
We are in a situation
that is beyond morality. Hm?

497
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:49,010
Your wife is dead.

498
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:54,810
How do you know? How can you be definitive
about a construct you do not understand?

499
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:57,810
She's a copy. A facsimile.

500
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:01,310
And she's seducing you all over again.

501
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:05,410
You're sick.

502
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:13,110
We are not taking her back with us.

503
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:30,510
Leave the light off.

504
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:46,110
You think you're dreaming me.

505
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,410
You're not Gibarian.

506
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:51,310
No?

507
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:54,710
Who am I, then?

508
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,710
- A puppet.
- And you're not?

509
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:00,410
Well, maybe you're my puppet.

510
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:04,310
But like all puppets,
you think you're actually human.

511
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:09,210
That's the puppet's dream - being human.

512
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:17,310
Why did you kill yourself?

513
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:21,310
It seemed like a good idea
at the time. Now I think I made a mistake.

514
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:26,010
- What about your son?
- That's not my son. My son is on Earth.

515
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:32,710
And that's not your wife.
They are part of Solaris. Remember that.

516
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:39,210
What does Solaris want from us?

517
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:42,910
Why do you think it has to want something?

518
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:48,910
This is why you have to leave.
If you keep thinking there is a solution...

519
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,710
you'll die here.

520
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:54,610
I can't leave her.

521
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:57,410
I'll figure it out.

522
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:00,510
Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

523
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:03,210
There are no answers.

524
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:07,210
Only choices.

525
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:30,110
Rheya?

526
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:39,310
Rheya?

527
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:53,710
Rheya?

528
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:15,110
Rheya?

529
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:24,910
Gordon!

530
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:10,210
- What happened?
- She drank liquid oxygen.

531
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:37,410
She's dead.

532
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:41,010
No.

533
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:08,410
I never get used to them.
These... resurrections.

534
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:10,510
Oh, no.

535
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:14,510
No.

536
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:23,810
Why'd you do that?

537
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:26,010
Rheya?

538
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:30,210
Don't call me that.

539
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:40,110
<i>There are two components.</i>

540
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:46,310
A high-energy proton accelerator
and a matter phase modulator.

541
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:52,610
By adjusting the tuning frequency I get an
enhancement of Higgs antibosons at 90GHz

542
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:57,010
and an almost pure beam at 160GHz.

543
01:06:57,410 --> 01:07:01,210
I used it on mine.

544
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:03,410
What happens?

545
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:08,610
They disappear,
back where they came from.

546
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:15,710
It's what she wants.

547
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:20,210
I won't let her do it.

548
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:24,910
She'll come to me when you're asleep.

549
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:30,710
Then I won't sleep.

550
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:35,510
<i>Don't you see?
I came from your memory of her.</i>

551
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:39,910
<i>That's the problem. I'm not a whole person.</i>

552
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:44,810
In your memory
you get to control everything.

553
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:49,710
So even if you remember something wrong,
I am predetermined to carry it out.

554
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:52,510
I'm suicidal because
that's how you remember me.

555
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:57,110
My voice sounds the way it does
because that's how you remember it.

556
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:01,710
I don't believe that we're
predetermined to relive our past.

557
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:06,410
I think that we can choose to do it differently.

558
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:13,310
The day I left and you said you wouldn't make
it, I didn't hear you because I was angry.

559
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:17,410
This is my chance to undo that mistake.

560
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:20,110
And I need you to help me.

561
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:24,710
But am I really Rheya?

562
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:31,210
I don't know any more.

563
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:35,910
All I see is you.

564
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:11,410
All I see is you.

565
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:23,010
It created me.

566
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:27,810
And yet I can't communicate with it.

567
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:32,110
It must hear me, though.

568
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:36,710
It must know what's happening to me.

569
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:41,210
And you and I, we would
have to have some kind of...

570
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:45,710
an arrangement, some kind of...

571
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,910
unspoken understanding...

572
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:57,310
that I'm not really a human being.

573
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:02,810
No, Rheya.

574
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:08,910
Chris...

575
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:13,310
Chris, I wish you would just
let them use the device on me.

576
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:21,110
And then you can go back to Earth
and you can tell everybody all about Solaris.

577
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:25,410
No.

578
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:30,610
It's the only solution that makes any sense.

579
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:35,110
We could never have
a life together on Earth, Chris.

580
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:38,910
You know that.

581
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:42,210
It would be impossible.

582
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:46,810
And this? What kind of life is this?

583
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,910
Trapped here.

584
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:52,510
It's not a life.

585
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:55,410
I don't know what to call it.

586
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:59,010
It's what we have.

587
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:01,410
It's enough for me.

588
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:04,310
You need to rest.

589
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:08,510
You're going to make yourself ill.

590
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:14,210
- I don't care.
- Just lie down for a moment.

591
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:16,510
Please, Chris.

592
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:20,410
You have to rest.

593
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:53,510
You know I'm not human
so I don't understand what you're afraid of.

594
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,210
Of course you can use the device.

595
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:59,810
It's not murder. You said that yourself.

596
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:03,610
You're the one who had
the idea in the first place.

597
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:08,110
Chris doesn't trust me. He...

598
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:06,110
<i>Chris, don't blame Gordon.</i>

599
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:11,510
<i>It's not her fault. I begged her to do it.</i>

600
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:15,510
<i>It's better this way.</i>

601
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:18,910
<i>I found the suicide note.</i>

602
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:22,210
<i>I went through your things.</i>

603
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:26,610
<i>The page torn from the book of poems.</i>

604
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:30,810
<i>And I realised...</i>

605
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:32,810
<i>I'm not her.</i>

606
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:36,610
<i>I'm not Rheya.</i>

607
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:39,710
<i>I know you loved me, though.</i>

608
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:43,310
<i>I know that. I felt that.</i>

609
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:46,110
<i>And I love you.</i>

610
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:51,610
<i>I wish we could just
live inside that feeling forever.</i>

611
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:56,410
<i>Maybe there's a place where we can.</i>

612
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:58,910
<i>But I know it's not on Earth.</i>

613
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:03,110
<i>And it's not on this ship.</i>

614
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:08,610
<i>That's all I can say right now.</i>

615
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:31,910
- You killed her!
- Not her. It.

616
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:35,910
- It's murder!
- Kelvin, she begged me. It wasn't painful.

617
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:37,510
- She'll be back!
- No.

618
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:40,410
- Why would you let her do it?!
- Kelvin!

619
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,510
It's not human!

620
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:47,110
Whatever it is, it's not human,
and I'm threatened by that.

621
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:50,210
And I wanna win. I want humans to win.

622
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:54,310
Whose side are you on?

623
01:18:54,610 --> 01:19:01,110
- What are you doing?
- Putting the Al back online. I'm going home.

624
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:18,210
Gordon.

625
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:22,910
Gordon!

626
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:49,810
- I knew it.
- How long you think he's been dead?

627
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:54,710
Hard to say because of the cold.

628
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:58,710
He attacked me.

629
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:03,610
There I am. Somehow, there I am.

630
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:09,410
And I couldn't tell you how I'm there,
or who I am or what's going on.

631
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:13,310
But before I can get to that,

632
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:15,810
what's this over here?

633
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:19,610
Comin' at me. What...
what are you tryin' to do?

634
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:23,010
Oh, I see. You're tryin' to kill me.

635
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:27,210
Yeah, confusing. I'll tell you somethin'
confusing. Bingo, there you are,

636
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:31,110
and my welcoming committee
dropped his knife and it's good night.

637
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:35,710
And, oh, by the way, after all that I find, uh...

638
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:40,610
this, uh, whoever this... I get my first
good look at it and it happens to be...

639
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:44,010
I survive the first 30 seconds of this...

640
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:48,110
life, whatever you wanna call it...
by killing someone.

641
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:53,810
And, oh, ah, by killing someone
who happens to be me.

642
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:58,910
See, most people... I would think most people
in this position would be, like "This... ah."

643
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:03,810
"I don't know." However, this is at least...
This is an incredible opportunity.

644
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:07,810
This is... What if this is a gift? I'm a gift.

645
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:11,710
Hey.

646
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:18,210
I say we use the Higgs device on him.

647
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:24,110
Mm. Mm-mm.

648
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:29,010
I don't think you really have time.

649
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:33,210
Why would you say that?

650
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:36,810
Well, you know, ever since
we used the famous Higgs device,

651
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:42,010
Solaris started taking on mass exponentially.

652
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:46,610
You might have noticed
how we're a lot closer to it.

653
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:50,910
That would be because everything
within its gravitational field -

654
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:55,210
it's pulling it in.

655
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:58,010
Ah, and, yeah, sorry. By the way,

656
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:04,410
the Higgs device also
drained the fuel cell reactors.

657
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:12,210
Uh, if... Can I make a suggestion?

658
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:17,410
I mean, this is... You can do what you want,
but I would just lock me in here really tight

659
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:21,910
and take the "Athena" back.

660
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:28,410
Wear your seat belt.

661
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:28,010
Switch to internal power.

662
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:31,710
Start fuel cell operational diagnostic.

663
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:34,910
Service check on LGA.

664
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:38,310
Point and calibrate high-beam antenna.

665
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:42,110
Depressurising. Spin all turbines to standby.

666
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:45,910
Disengage coupling interlocks
and all docking couplers.

667
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:51,010
Vent and seal
all main engine propellant lines.

668
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:10,110
<i>Earth.</i>

669
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:14,110
<i>Even the word sounded strange to me now.</i>

670
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:18,010
<i>Unfamiliar.</i>

671
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:23,410
<i>How long had I been gone?</i>

672
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:26,910
<i>How long had I been back?</i>

673
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:30,910
<i>Did it matter?</i>

674
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:39,610
<i>I tried to find the rhythm
of the world where I used to live.</i>

675
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:42,810
<i>I followed the current.</i>

676
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:47,010
<i>I was silent and attentive.</i>

677
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:50,910
<i>I made a conscious effort to smile...</i>

678
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:53,210
<i>nod...</i>

679
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:55,910
<i>stand...</i>

680
01:24:56,210 --> 01:25:02,510
<i>and perform the millions of gestures
that constitute life on Earth.</i>

681
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:10,010
<i>I studied these gestures
until they became reflexes again.</i>

682
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:14,310
<i>But I was haunted by the idea</i>

683
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:18,710
<i>that I remembered her wrong.</i>

684
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:25,510
<i>That somehow I was wrong about everything.</i>

685
01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:33,910
Depressurising.
Spin all turbines to standby.

686
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:38,110
Disengage coupling interlocks
and all docking couplers.

687
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:43,310
Vent and seal
all main engine propellant lines.

688
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:49,110
Rheya!

689
01:27:56,910 --> 01:28:00,310
Rheya?

690
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:16,910
Chris?

691
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:20,610
Chris?

692
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:04,610
Am I alive... or dead?

693
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:11,410
We don't have to think like that any more.

694
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:18,010
We're together now.

695
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:23,310
Everything we've done is forgiven.

696
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:27,010
Everything.
