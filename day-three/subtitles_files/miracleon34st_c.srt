1
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,584
- Ask him.
- Shh!

2
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,661
- Ask him.
- Shh!

3
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:06,260
Look at him, grandpa.
Ask him!

4
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,436
Ryan, that's enough.

5
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:15,823
Uh, I'm sorry.
He, uh...he thinks you're Santa Claus.

6
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:25,394
I am.

7
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:29,859
Merry christmas.

8
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:31,574
Uh, merry--Merry christmas.

9
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:35,383
Nuts.
I should have got his autograph.

10
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:46,124
Dashing through the snow

11
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,276
In a one-horse open sleigh

12
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:52,110
O'er the fields we go

13
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,106
Laughing all the way

14
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:57,922
Bells on bobtail ring

15
00:02:57,922 --> 00:03:00,701
Making spirits bright

16
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:03,626
What fun it is to laugh and sing

17
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:06,006
In a sleighing song tonight

18
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:09,516
oh, jingle bells, jingle bells

19
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:12,349
jingle all the way

20
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:15,129
oh, what fun it is to ride

21
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,556
in a one-horse open sleigh

22
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:20,905
hey, jingle bells, jingle bells

23
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:23,793
jingle all the way

24
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:26,306
oh, what fun it is to ride

25
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:30,508
in a one-horse open sleigh

26
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:35,311
What is the problem?

27
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:38,668
Your Santa Claus is wearing
a topcoat and a fedora.

28
00:03:41,548 --> 00:03:44,665
Ya-ha! Ha ha ha ha!

29
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:47,000
That's not my Santa Claus.

30
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:52,000
Right. Now...throw it out...

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,807
Bring it up right up high,
and down she comes!

32
00:03:58,202 --> 00:03:59,933
It's just in the wrist, you see.

33
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:04,011
It's really quite simple, you know,
when you get the knack.

34
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:06,677
Now then, why don't you--

35
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:13,733
o.k., pops, come on. It's my turn.
Give me the whip.

36
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,075
What have you been drinking?

37
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:17,300
Just something to keep me warm.

38
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,084
You are intoxicated, sir.

39
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:20,802
And you're a pain in the butt.

40
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,961
You are a disgrace.

41
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:26,630
You have any idea how many children
are watching you?

42
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,484
Give me back the whip.

43
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:31,280
Let me tell you something--
when you put on this suit,

44
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,950
you represent something that has
great significance to millions of people

45
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,441
all over the world.

46
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:43,081
Now, I could overlook your
poorly-manufactured jacket

47
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:46,086
or even your ludicrously
unbelievable beard.

48
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:46,563
Hey!

49
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:49,430
Or perhaps your
phonily-padded tummy,

50
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,798
but I will not tolerate
public drunkenness.

51
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:56,385
You should be ashamed of yourself.

52
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,163
Can I get a cop over here?

53
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:00,992
That's a very good idea. Officer!

54
00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:03,548
Hey, wait a minute, you.

55
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:06,043
Mrs. Walker! Mrs. Walker!

56
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:08,393
Mrs. Walker, we need your help here!

57
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:12,497
Your sense of occasion is something--

58
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:15,863
If you're not with the parade,
get back on the sidewalk.

59
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:19,908
I need to see whomever's in charge
to alert them to this man.

60
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:21,625
Kiss my--

61
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,357
Oh, easy! Take it easy!

62
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,642
Gramps, come on, hey.

63
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:26,737
Let's go for a little walk.

64
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:34,650
That man's a degenerate.

65
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,057
It's time to go right up in the old office.

66
00:05:39,057 --> 00:05:40,273
Ha ha!

67
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:45,819
Little drafty there.

68
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:49,480
Hey, let's just watch the parade, o.k.?

69
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,678
Come on.

70
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:53,035
O.k. Settle in here.

71
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:54,199
Oh!

72
00:05:56,987 --> 00:05:59,021
Oh, my god.

73
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:06,368
Get this costume fixed.
O.k. We'll show this guy how to do it.

74
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:09,585
Whoa!

75
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:11,504
Aah!

76
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:16,381
Oh.

77
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:23,357
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

78
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:27,078
Merry christmas to all,
and to all a good night.

79
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:48,682
Sir! Excuse me.

80
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:51,325
- Hello. I-I'm Dorey walker.
- Oh.

81
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:54,735
Director of special projects for
c.f. Cole's department store.

82
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:58,952
My pleasure. As a matter of fact,
I was looking for you.

83
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:03,180
There's no doubt you saw
your Santa Claus is inebriated.

84
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,548
I know. He has created
such a terrible problem.

85
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:09,973
Millions of children are watching here
and on television.

86
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:13,733
They're expecting to see Santa Claus,
and now we don't have one.

87
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,247
That is a terrible problem.

88
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:20,919
Would you do it?
Would you be our Santa Claus?

89
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:23,883
Uh, me?

90
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:25,973
Well, do you have any experience?

91
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:28,730
Well...just a little.

92
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,112
Great. I'm sure you'll be fine.

93
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:31,831
Isn't there someone else
that you could ask?

94
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:34,967
Sir, the parade has started already.

95
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,744
It's you right now, or else

96
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:40,640
There's no Santa in the cole's
thanksgiving day parade.

97
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,629
Might I perhaps have a moment
to think about it?

98
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:52,935
Don't worry about a thing. Just...
be yourself.

99
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:10,965
Now, dasher!
Now, dancer!

100
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:13,302
Now, prancer and vixen!

101
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:17,906
Now, comet! Now, cupid!
Now, donner and blitzen!

102
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:18,933
Hey!

103
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,129
Merry christmas.
Merry chris--

104
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,190
This Santa Claus is fantastic.

105
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:36,834
Did he sign a contract?

106
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:38,463
There wasn't any time.

107
00:08:38,463 --> 00:08:40,591
Myrna's going to have him sign
after the parade.

108
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:44,721
She'll have him fill out his employment
papers, and he'll start in the morning.

109
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:48,911
He insisted upon wearing
his own Santa suit.

110
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:51,247
He has his own Santa suit?

111
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:53,207
Apparently.

112
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:55,911
Well, if it's horrible, we'll make him
wear one of ours.

113
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:58,935
I'm going home.

114
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:01,486
You're not going to watch the parade?

115
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:04,760
No. I think I've had quite enough
for one day, thank you.

116
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,279
I will see you in the morning.

117
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,758
O.k. Chin-chin.

118
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:13,168
Merry christmas.

119
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:19,796
Susan?

120
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:47,091
We can see the parade from his window,

121
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:50,363
so put on something comfortable
And come on over.

122
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:54,316
P.S., Mr. Bedford put the turkey
in the oven.

123
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:57,098
He said you forgot to sew up
the turkey's bottom.

124
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:59,397
The stuffing will all fall out,

125
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:03,172
but he told me not to say anything
Because he loves you,

126
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:06,859
and he wants to kiss you, and he thinks you're

127
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:09,339
The most beautiful woman in the whole world!

128
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,796
Do you know how much it costs
to make this parade?

129
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:25,250
Uh, a million dollars. $2 million?

130
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,671
1.6. It's probably a big mistake.

131
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:32,434
Some guy's going to buy cole's
and turn it into a junk store.

132
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:36,734
That's not going to happen.
Two banks just came in and rescued cole's.

133
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:38,077
You better check your sources.

134
00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:41,621
But cole's has to pay them back plus interest.

135
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:45,536
If they don't sell a lot at christmas,
you can forget about it, pal.

136
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:51,544
Well, I think you should ask Santa Claus
to give cole's an interest-free loan For christmas.

137
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:53,200
What do you think about that?

138
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,585
That's a good one

139
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:57,761
Well, you know what?
It might happen.

140
00:10:57,761 --> 00:11:01,570
Santa Claus,
he does some pretty amazing things.

141
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:06,303
Bryan, you know what? I know.

142
00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:07,379
You know what?

143
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:08,649
The secret.

144
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,381
What secret?

145
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:15,090
Santa Claus.
I've known for a long time.

146
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,637
He's not real.

147
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,131
Says who?

148
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:28,826
My mom.

149
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:45,338
Hi.
I believe you have something of mine.

150
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:49,646
About 4-foot tall, brown hair,
talks like she's 64 years old?

151
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:53,106
Hey.

152
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:56,560
Hi. / Hi.

153
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,550
So, what do you think?

154
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,440
It's a good one.

155
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,990
Yeah? Did Santa Claus come by yet?

156
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,925
Nope. Is it Tony falacchi again?

157
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:11,800
No. Tony had to leave.

158
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,480
Bombed?

159
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,871
Yes.

160
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:16,947
It's the pressure.

161
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:22,963
But I got this new guy, and
he really looks like the real thing.

162
00:12:22,963 --> 00:12:24,518
Maybe he is.

163
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,336
Are you still coming to dinner?

164
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:33,879
Am I still invited?

165
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,913
Yes.

166
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:36,023
Then I'm coming.

167
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:38,789
Honey, run home and put the camera stuff away.

168
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:40,663
I'll put the stuff away. You keep watching.

169
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:45,036
Let her finish watching the parade. Come on.

170
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:47,265
Santa hasn't even come by yet.

171
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:52,749
Well, as soon as Santa does come by,
I would like for you to come home.

172
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,304
Sure.

173
00:12:54,304 --> 00:12:56,605
That's the end of the parade, anyway.

174
00:12:56,605 --> 00:13:00,258
There's nothing else to see except
guys cleaning up horse poop,

175
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:02,719
And that doesn't thrill me at all.

176
00:13:07,038 --> 00:13:10,581
Hello!
Merry christmas!

177
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,150
- Hello?
- Jack?

178
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,634
Yes, sir.

179
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:39,829
I've been watching the parade.

180
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:41,591
It looks bigger than last year.

181
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,977
What is the crowd estimate?

182
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:47,561
Well, sir, cops say over a million.

183
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,057
Last year was about 750.

184
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:54,429
Have marketing come up with a giveaway,
something free.

185
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:58,115
I don't want a crowd outside
cole's in the morning.

186
00:13:58,115 --> 00:14:00,896
I hate to say this, Mr. Lamberg.

187
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:03,750
Cole's has got one hell of a
Santa Claus this year.

188
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,488
If I didn'tknow better,
I'd say he was the real article.

189
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:10,662
Keep an eye on this, Mr. Duff.

190
00:14:10,662 --> 00:14:15,702
These small, seemingly insignificant,
sentimental anachronisms

191
00:14:15,702 --> 00:14:19,926
can be surprisingly potent.

192
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:24,340
I don't want my plans damaged by
an elderly cherub in a red suit.

193
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:26,308
I'm on it, sir.

194
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:32,710
Bye-bye.

195
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:44,727
There we go.

196
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:47,873
- Ooh. Ooh. Ahh. Ahh.
- Happy thanksgiving.

197
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:50,495
- Happy thanksgiving.
- Happy thanksgiving

198
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:55,577
You know, this is kind of like TV,

199
00:14:55,577 --> 00:14:58,201
except I need a brother and a dog,

200
00:14:58,201 --> 00:14:59,930
And Bryan would be the dad--

201
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,628
Mr. Bedford.

202
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,523
He said to call him Bryan.

203
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,340
Only if it's o.k. with your mom.

204
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,934
It's fine.

205
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:11,194
Bryan would be the dad, you'd be the mom.

206
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:14,651
We'd need either a fat person
who's our cook

207
00:15:14,651 --> 00:15:16,963
or a neighbor who's
Always at our house.

208
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:21,698
You know, that's not very interesting.
Let's talk about something else.

209
00:15:21,698 --> 00:15:22,814
For the chef.

210
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:25,367
Oh, in the loosest sense of the word.

211
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:27,526
In every sense of the word.

212
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:32,294
The vegetables are catered.
So is dessert.

213
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:36,203
Thank you, Susan.

214
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,615
You're welcome.

215
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:42,204
Do we give blessings in this house?

216
00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:45,572
Not unless my grandparents are here.

217
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:48,717
Would you mind if I did it?
It's a tradition with me.

218
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:49,822
No. That's fine.

219
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,906
We give thanks for thfood before us

220
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:59,871
and the closeness
Of the people we love,

221
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,889
and we pray that these gifts
We so gratefully receive

222
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:07,261
will be shared with those less
fortunate than ourselves.

223
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:08,162
Amen.

224
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:10,686
Amen.

225
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,590
All right. Let's eat.

226
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:16,835
I slaved all day.

227
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:20,159
You really outdid yourself.

228
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:54,788
One of my elves is married to
a fellow called Daniel.

229
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:56,384
Do you know what you want for christmas?

230
00:18:56,384 --> 00:19:02,240
I want  a peter pollywog
patrol frog that swims and blows up.

231
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,449
Gosh, that sounds great

232
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,287
Can mother have a word with Santa, please?

233
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:12,417
Yes, of course. Just a minute.

234
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,346
Don't make me look bad.
Them things cost 70 bucks.

235
00:19:15,346 --> 00:19:16,862
He just looked at them.

236
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:19,582
I tell you what.

237
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:22,888
Shopper's express have got them
on sale at 34.Lamberg

238
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:26,783
with a $5.00 rebate.
Now that's reasonable enough, isn't it?

239
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:29,332
Yeah. Thanks.

240
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:30,637
But let me ask you a question.

241
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:33,170
Since when is cole's sending
customers someplace else?

242
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,538
I don't think it matters where the toys are sold
as long as it makes the children happy.

243
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:40,853
I'm sure the people here believe the same.

244
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,062
Yeah. Yeah, that's the spirit.

245
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:46,663
Thanks, Santa. Thank you.

246
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:49,172
- Merry christmas.
- Merry christmas.

247
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:52,559
Now then, young man,
if you're a very good boy

248
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,446
And do exactly what your mummy tells you,

249
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:58,933
you're going to have a peter pollywog
for christmas.

250
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:01,084
Ha ha ha ha ha.

251
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:02,335
Bye, Santa.

252
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:06,608
Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Daniel.
Merry christmas.

253
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:08,499
Come on, then. Come on.

254
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,181
You the boss?

255
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,196
I'm general manager of the store.

256
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:21,940
My kid asked Santa for a barf gun.
The Santa said he'd get it for him.

257
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,954
They're by the elevator.

258
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:27,384
And they're 90 bucks
without batteries or barf.

259
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:28,266
Prices do go up.

260
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,317
Apparently not at bargain village.

261
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:32,884
52.50.
They throw in the batteries.

262
00:20:32,884 --> 00:20:36,537
I find it hard to believe cole's could be
undersold by that much.

263
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:38,486
Where did you get your information?

264
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:40,523
From your Santa Claus.

265
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:46,888
But if you go out of here,
turn to the right...

266
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:47,572
Excuse me?

267
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:49,910
Santa's telling everybody
where to shop.

268
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:54,416
If you don't got it, it's too expensive,
he's saying where to get it at the right price.

269
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,091
- You're serious?
- Absolutely.

270
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:58,832
Madam, will you excuse me for a moment?

271
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:01,810
Tell Santa he made me a cole's shopper.

272
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,593
I'm coming here for everything
but toilet paper.

273
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:09,292
Any store that puts the parent ahead
of the buck at christmas deserves my business.

274
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:12,540
Tell Mr. Cole his Santa Claus
ought to get a raise.

275
00:21:19,498 --> 00:21:22,720
You want me to go with you to the chairman

276
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,312
and pitch an idea
That you got from Santa Claus?

277
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:30,610
If cole's doesn't have what you're looking for,

278
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,093
we'll find it for you,

279
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:34,823
Even if it means sending you somewhere else.

280
00:21:34,823 --> 00:21:36,324
how does that sound?

281
00:21:36,324 --> 00:21:39,764
It sounds like a great way
to go out of business.

282
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:43,789
Know that house in the country
where we do the catalog shoot?

283
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:45,132
You wanted to buy it.

284
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:46,141
Yes.

285
00:21:46,141 --> 00:21:49,242
If this works, we're probably
looking at a bonus.

286
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:53,205
And if he hates the idea?

287
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:54,556
We're no worse off.

288
00:21:54,556 --> 00:21:56,194
If we don't turn this store around,

289
00:21:56,194 --> 00:21:58,772
we're all out--
From the chairman to the janitor.

290
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,580
Let's do it.

291
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:22,449
I...like it.
It's bold. It's fresh.

292
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:26,598
It will drive victor lamberg nuts.

293
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:36,408
It's beginning to look a lot like
christmas

294
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:40,238
soon the bells will start

295
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:44,542
And the thing that will make them ring
is the carol that you sing

296
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:48,978
Right within your heart

297
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:54,413
it's beginning to look a lot like christmas

298
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:56,962
Why?

299
00:22:56,962 --> 00:23:00,438
Why didn't you think of this?

300
00:23:00,438 --> 00:23:04,196
Now if this campaign is successful--
I know in my gut it will be--

301
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:05,696
Cole's will make lots of money.

302
00:23:05,696 --> 00:23:10,267
The more money they make,
the harder it will be for me to buy them out.

303
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,817
Now I want  something done about this.

304
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:29,943
O.k., go ahead.

305
00:23:33,418 --> 00:23:35,939
This seems like a pretty pointless exercise, Bryan.

306
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:42,090
I thought as long as we were here,
might as well say hello to the old guy.

307
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,154
Why?

308
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:47,071
Let's just say for the sake of argument
that there is a Santa Claus

309
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:49,851
And that you don't believe in him.

310
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:54,282
Is it worth the risk that you might not
get anything for christmas?

311
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:55,883
Well, I didn't believe in him last year.

312
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:59,460
I still got everything i asked my mother for.

313
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,799
Yeah. You get a free candy cane?

314
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:07,589
I'm trying to limit my intake of sugar.

315
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,823
She can go see Santa now.

316
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,592
O.k., come on. Go ahead.

317
00:24:16,813 --> 00:24:17,902
Nice to meet you.

318
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,461
Hello, sir.

319
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:27,515
Oh, how do you do?

320
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:29,763
Would you like to come sit on my knee?

321
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:32,215
Good. Up you come.

322
00:24:32,215 --> 00:24:33,509
Now then, what's your name?

323
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:36,609
Susan elizabeth walker. What's yours?

324
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,783
Mine?
Ha ha ha ha.

325
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:41,137
Well, I have lots of names.

326
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:42,696
Uh, Kriss kringle,

327
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:45,476
Santa Claus, father christmas,
saint nicholas.

328
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:51,189
If you were in holland, I'd be sinterklaas,
or in italy, le befana.

329
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:56,562
I have to speak many languages
because, of course, I travel a great deal.

330
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:01,556
That's russian.

331
00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:07,492
That's swahili.

332
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:09,280
My mother's Mrs. Walker.

333
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,529
She's director of special events for cole's.

334
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:12,553
Uh-huh.

335
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:17,190
She runs the parade.
I know how this all works.

336
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,404
You're an employee of cole's.

337
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:22,905
That is true.

338
00:25:22,905 --> 00:25:25,466
But you're a very good Santa Claus.

339
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:27,752
Your beard's stuck on real tight.

340
00:25:27,752 --> 00:25:31,732
Usually the store Santa Claus
whiskers are too loose.

341
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:33,183
Yours look realistic.

342
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:36,413
That's because they are real.
You give them a tug.

343
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:39,107
Whoo! Ha ha ha.

344
00:25:39,107 --> 00:25:40,159
Are you convinced?

345
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,262
Mm-hmm.

346
00:25:41,262 --> 00:25:42,473
Good.

347
00:25:42,473 --> 00:25:44,930
This isn't the regular Santa suit, is it?

348
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:48,438
Oh, no. This is the real Santa suit.

349
00:25:48,438 --> 00:25:49,532
It's very nice.

350
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:51,392
I agree. Lovely.

351
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:56,030
Gold buttons, gold thread.
It's as real as me.

352
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,584
Well, you ask your daddy if I'm real.

353
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:03,131
I don't know where he is.

354
00:26:03,131 --> 00:26:04,051
Well, he's--

355
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:08,282
That's my friend Mr. Bedford.

356
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:10,285
I don't have a dad anymore.

357
00:26:17,724 --> 00:26:21,352
Ha. Well, now,
what can I get you for christmas?

358
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:22,908
Nothing, thank you.

359
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:24,657
Nothing?

360
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:26,554
My mother buys my gifts

361
00:26:26,554 --> 00:26:31,396
if I don't  want something too stupid
or dangerous or...

362
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:32,932
Hi, mom.

363
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:46,680
Hi. It's nice to see you.

364
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:49,959
Susan,
you've taken enough of this man's time.

365
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:53,439
There's a long line of customers,
and they do come first.

366
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:59,409
Nice to meet you, Susan.

367
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,213
Nice to meet you, too.

368
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,720
Bye-bye.

369
00:27:10,701 --> 00:27:12,253
Nonbelievers.

370
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:14,193
Right.

371
00:27:19,408 --> 00:27:23,309
If I felt that it was important for her
to see Santa Claus,

372
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,539
I would be happy to take her.

373
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:28,786
I didn'tsee any harm in her saying hello
to an interesting old man.

374
00:27:28,786 --> 00:27:34,227
Well, there is harm.
I tell her that there is no Santa Claus,

375
00:27:34,227 --> 00:27:39,419
so you bring her down here,
And she sees thousands of gullible kids,

376
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:42,710
and she meets an actor  a very good actor,
mind you?

377
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,693
with a real beard and a beautiful Santa suit,

378
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:50,760
Sitting smack dab in the center
of a child's fantasy world.

379
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:58,735
So, who does she believe, the myth or...
the mom?

380
00:28:05,356 --> 00:28:08,497
Listen, I just got some mistletoe.

381
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:12,082
Why don't we go back to my place
and try it out?

382
00:28:12,082 --> 00:28:13,954
No.

383
00:28:13,954 --> 00:28:15,628
I don't  think so.

384
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:25,588
O.k. I'm here. I can help.
All you have to do is ask.

385
00:28:25,588 --> 00:28:28,034
Well, actually, there is one thing.

386
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:32,899
Would you mind taking Susan home?

387
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,751
Sure.

388
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,281
I'm working at cole's.

389
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:24,258
All I have to do is to be myself.

390
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:30,703
There you are. Ha ha.
That's it.

391
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:33,516
Very good. Very good.

392
00:29:33,516 --> 00:29:34,678
Excuse me.

393
00:29:34,678 --> 00:29:36,175
Oh.

394
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,358
Good evening.

395
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,690
Good evening.

396
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,179
My name is jack duff.

397
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,011
How do you do?

398
00:29:41,011 --> 00:29:43,087
And this is alberta leonard.

399
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:44,107
How do you do?

400
00:29:44,107 --> 00:29:45,254
Pleasure.

401
00:29:45,254 --> 00:29:49,347
Nice to meet you both. I'm Kriss kringle.

402
00:29:49,347 --> 00:29:51,352
Well, Mr. Kringle,

403
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:53,968
we're with shopper's express,
the department store.

404
00:29:53,968 --> 00:29:57,227
Yes. You've got the peter pollywog on sale.

405
00:29:57,227 --> 00:29:58,947
Right.

406
00:29:58,947 --> 00:30:01,390
Yes, we do.

407
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,992
We want you to be our main Santa Claus.

408
00:30:03,992 --> 00:30:06,941
We have over 7,000 stores worldwide,

409
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:09,364
but you would be the number one guy.

410
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:12,439
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,

411
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,830
but the people at cole's have already hired me.

412
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,126
In fact, I've signed a contract.

413
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:21,729
If you'll excuse me, it's getting a bit late.

414
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:23,002
Give you a ride?

415
00:30:23,002 --> 00:30:26,299
I can walk. It's probably out of your way.

416
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:27,458
Where are you going?

417
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:33,258
4th street, the mount carmel senior center.

418
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:34,973
We're going right by it.

419
00:30:34,973 --> 00:30:36,579
It's on our way.

420
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:38,893
Thank you so much.

421
00:30:38,893 --> 00:30:41,779
Um, bye-bye, prancer.

422
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,334
Bye-bye, dancer.

423
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:52,558
So tell me, Santa.

424
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,065
How does one guy get to every house
around the world in one night?

425
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:01,694
Ah, yes. Well, now
that is a vexing question, isn't it?

426
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:06,732
You see, if you could slow time down
so that a second became a year,

427
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:11,034
A minute became a century,
and an hour became a millennium,

428
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:14,374
Well, you could manage it quite easily,
couldn't you?

429
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:17,358
I remember before--Well,
100 years ago,

430
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:19,488
before the population explosion,

431
00:31:19,488 --> 00:31:21,384
I could manage
To deliver all my goods

432
00:31:21,384 --> 00:31:25,289
and have enough time left over for a
late supper, A nap,

433
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:28,547
and a round of golf
with the easter bunny.

434
00:31:28,547 --> 00:31:31,793
He winters in new zealand, you know.

435
00:31:36,577 --> 00:31:38,701
Thank you so much.

436
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:41,038
Thank you both very much indeed.

437
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,152
Merry christmas to you, miss leonard.

438
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,673
Merry, merry christmas to you, Mr. Duff.

439
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:48,532
Same to you, Santa.

440
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,352
Thank you very much.
Good night.

441
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:01,090
He's completely out of his mind.

442
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:05,771
Imagine--cole's hiring a guy
as nutty as that.

443
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:07,722
Could become a problem for them.

444
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:11,021
I know what you mean.

445
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,900
The easter bunny.

446
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:24,424
Nice to meet you.

447
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,381
Bye-bye now.

448
00:32:27,832 --> 00:32:29,778
You don't think he's nuts, do you?

449
00:32:29,778 --> 00:32:30,489
Hmm?

450
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:34,500
Well, he believes he's Santa Claus,
absolutely believes it.

451
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,502
Maybe that's why he's good at it.

452
00:32:36,502 --> 00:32:38,006
What difference does it make?

453
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:40,134
Look at our stocks.
They're through the roof.

454
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:42,596
Sales are up 70% over last holiday.

455
00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:44,825
In a week,
this company has turned around.

456
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:49,449
We could go the other way just
as fast if this guy does anything wrong.

457
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:50,313
What's he going to do?

458
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:52,146
We don't know.

459
00:32:52,146 --> 00:32:56,180
If the fate of the company rests
on one very unstable old man,

460
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,951
You're celebrating our return
just a little too soon.

461
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:01,568
I'm not worried.

462
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,634
Hello, little one. How are you? Come.

463
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:15,303
Uh, she's deaf.

464
00:33:15,303 --> 00:33:19,200
You don't have to talk to her.
She just wanted to see you.

465
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,641
Thank you.

466
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:41,282
You are a very... Beautiful young lady.

467
00:33:41,282 --> 00:33:43,179
Ha ha ha ha.

468
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:46,706
What's your name?

469
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:51,203
Sami?

470
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:54,887
That's a beautiful name.

471
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:58,064
Ha ha ha ha.

472
00:33:58,064 --> 00:34:03,918
Now I tell you what.
Do you know Jingle bells?

473
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:06,238
Yes.

474
00:34:06,238 --> 00:34:10,543
jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way

475
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:16,328
oh, what fun it is to ride
on a one-horse open sleigh

476
00:34:16,328 --> 00:34:18,753
Ha ha. Oh, very good.

477
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:31,423
Darling,
what would you like for christmas?

478
00:34:31,423 --> 00:34:33,939
A doll and a bear?

479
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:36,130
Well, you shall have them.

480
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:41,574
Sami, I wish you a merry... Christmas.

481
00:34:43,344 --> 00:34:46,621
&nbsp;

482
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:48,519
Thank you. Thank you.

483
00:34:50,017 --> 00:34:54,013
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

484
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:23,476
Something's driving me crazy,
and I can't sleep.

485
00:35:23,476 --> 00:35:25,183
What's on your mind?

486
00:35:25,183 --> 00:35:27,183
Santa Claus.

487
00:35:27,183 --> 00:35:30,016
Mr. Kringle? Why, what about him?

488
00:35:30,016 --> 00:35:33,703
He talked sign language with a kid today.

489
00:35:33,703 --> 00:35:37,743
Well, that was considerate of him.

490
00:35:37,743 --> 00:35:41,336
It's weird how he knows
so much about toys and kids.

491
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:43,874
He speaks russian and swahili.

492
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:49,670
Well, he must be quite a learned man.

493
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:55,738
He looks exactly like every
picture of Santa Claus I ever saw.

494
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:59,513
Yes, I know. That's why I chose him.

495
00:35:59,513 --> 00:36:04,657
You're positive he's not
the real Santa Claus?

496
00:36:04,657 --> 00:36:08,691
I thought that we talked about this.

497
00:36:08,691 --> 00:36:10,926
You understand what he is.

498
00:36:10,926 --> 00:36:12,512
What if we're wrong?

499
00:36:12,512 --> 00:36:16,145
That would be extremely rude.

500
00:36:16,145 --> 00:36:19,318
Well, we're not ong sweetheart.

501
00:36:19,318 --> 00:36:22,348
But all my friends believe in Santa Claus.

502
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,687
Well, most children your age do.

503
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:29,488
How come I don't ?

504
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:31,581
Because you know the truth,

505
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:36,084
and truth is one of the most important
things in the world.

506
00:36:36,084 --> 00:36:39,340
To know the truth and to always
be truthful with others

507
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,897
and, more importantly, with yourself.

508
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:52,542
Believing in myths and fantasies
just makes you unhappy.

509
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:56,658
Did you believe in Santa Claus
when you were my age?

510
00:36:56,658 --> 00:36:58,155
Yes.

511
00:36:58,155 --> 00:37:01,861
Were you unhappy?

512
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:07,190
Well, when all the things that I believed
in turned out not to be true,

513
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,970
yes, I was unhappy.

514
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:16,327
Would it be o.k. If I thought about this more?

515
00:37:16,327 --> 00:37:19,662
Do I have to not believe in Santa Claus
right away?

516
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:23,482
Come here.

517
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,822
You have the right to believe
whatever you want to believe.

518
00:37:32,822 --> 00:37:38,895
Now, I've told you the truth,
but if I'm wrong, I will be glad to admit it.

519
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:42,559
I'll tell you what. You ask Mr. Kringle

520
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,033
for something that
you would never ask me for,

521
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:49,166
And if on christmas morning
you don't get it,

522
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:54,584
you will know Once and for all
the honest truth about Santa Claus.

523
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:56,617
That's a very clever idea.

524
00:37:57,434 --> 00:38:00,153
Thank you.
Think you can get some sleep?

525
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,239
- Yep.
- Yeah? Give me a kiss.

526
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:07,777
Good night.
I love you.

527
00:38:07,777 --> 00:38:09,337
I love you.

528
00:38:09,337 --> 00:38:11,160
- Good night.
- Good night.

529
00:38:28,314 --> 00:38:37,432
christmas christmas

530
00:38:37,432 --> 00:38:42,030
well, it's christmas time, pretty baby

531
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,424
and the snow is
Fallin' on the ground

532
00:38:44,424 --> 00:38:48,752
christmas christmas

533
00:38:48,752 --> 00:38:52,323
well, it's christmas time, pretty baby...

534
00:38:52,323 --> 00:38:54,661
Barkeep! Reload on this.

535
00:38:55,197 --> 00:38:57,592
Hey. Hey!

536
00:38:57,592 --> 00:38:59,592
Can I get another beer?

537
00:38:59,592 --> 00:39:02,959
Boy, that cole's, they dealt me the high, hard one.

538
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:04,671
I did a good job for them last year.

539
00:39:04,671 --> 00:39:08,126
This year they give me the--the royal fist.

540
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:12,726
They didn't have grounds
on which to dismiss you.

541
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:14,949
That broad that runs the parade every year--

542
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:17,270
One of these college kids
with a 3 ounce brain

543
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,005
and 50 tons of attitude--

544
00:39:20,866 --> 00:39:24,732
She hires some wacko right off the street
to take my place.

545
00:39:24,732 --> 00:39:27,492
Some wacko?
Tell me about him.

546
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:29,497
He's a loon.

547
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:31,330
We got thousands in this city.

548
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,839
I'll say.

549
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:34,776
Never had one of them
take my job, though.

550
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:40,037
Tony, did you have any contact
with this old guy?

551
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:43,671
The guy come up on the float, right in my face.

552
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:45,172
He got aggressive with you.

553
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:49,391
He tried to whack me over
the head with his cane.

554
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:51,444
He tried to whack you with a cane?

555
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:52,775
Isn't that what I just said?

556
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,701
Tony, this'll make you feel better.

557
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,212
Got a little job I want  you to do for me.

558
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:16,721
What, uh, what kind of job
you have in mind?

559
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:17,736
You'll see.

560
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:31,314
Just be yourself.

561
00:40:31,314 --> 00:40:34,984
Don't even think about the camera.
You'll be just fine.

562
00:40:34,984 --> 00:40:36,712
Right.

563
00:40:36,712 --> 00:40:40,061
I must confess, I don't know
why they're making such a fuss about me.

564
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:43,814
This is the holiday season,
and you're Santa Claus, right?

565
00:40:43,814 --> 00:40:47,216
To many, but to others I'm an old man
with a white beard.

566
00:40:47,216 --> 00:40:50,009
But you're still the symbol of the season.

567
00:40:51,903 --> 00:40:54,541
You think I'm a fraud, don't you?

568
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:56,808
Fraud is a bit too strong a word.

569
00:40:56,808 --> 00:40:59,412
But you don't believe in me.

570
00:40:59,412 --> 00:41:02,939
I believe that christmas is for children.

571
00:41:02,939 --> 00:41:05,649
Your daughter doesn't believe in me, either.

572
00:41:05,649 --> 00:41:09,648
I don't think that there's any harm in
not believing in a figure

573
00:41:09,648 --> 00:41:13,083
that many do acknowledge
to be a fiction.

574
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:17,707
Oh, but there is.
I'm not just a whimsical figure

575
00:41:17,707 --> 00:41:20,753
who wears a charming suit

576
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:23,834
And affects a jolly demeanor.

577
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:28,554
You know, I..I...I'm a symbol.

578
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:32,404
I'm a symbol Of the human ability
to be able to suppress

579
00:41:32,404 --> 00:41:41,479
the selfish And hateful tendencies
that rule the major part of our lives.

580
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:46,669
If...you can't believe, if you can't accept

581
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:50,926
anything on faith,

582
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:54,586
Then you're doomed for
a life dominated by doubt.

583
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,225
I like you very much, Mrs...

584
00:42:05,225 --> 00:42:08,418
Mrs. Walker, you're a fine woman.
And, you know,

585
00:42:08,418 --> 00:42:14,486
I think you'll make an excellent test case
for me, you and your daughter.

586
00:42:14,486 --> 00:42:17,400
If I could make you believe,

587
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,946
then there'd be some hope for me.

588
00:42:20,946 --> 00:42:25,754
If I can't... Well, I'm finished.

589
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:36,705
Shall we go?

590
00:42:41,237 --> 00:42:46,275
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

591
00:42:46,905 --> 00:42:51,730
I'm Kriss kringle, and I'm at cole's
department store in new york city.

592
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,567
Good morning, america.

593
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:07,126
No. Mr. Kringle's time is extremely limited.

594
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,428
Sorry. Mr. Bedford's on line three.

595
00:43:10,428 --> 00:43:12,790
No. He can't do private sessions.

596
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,708
Can you hold for just a moment? Hang on.

597
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:21,277
Hi. Bryan, I have the mayor's office on hold.
What's up?

598
00:43:21,277 --> 00:43:26,553
If I can arrange a really, really good
Babysitter for tonight,

599
00:43:26,553 --> 00:43:28,405
you want to do some shopping
and have dinner?

600
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:31,308
Well, I'm not sure when I...

601
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,996
I don't know if I can get celia tonight.

602
00:43:32,996 --> 00:43:36,205
I'll take care of it. See you at 7:00?

603
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:39,694
Well, I-I-I'm not sure what--o.k.

604
00:43:39,694 --> 00:43:42,456
Fine. 7:00. Bye.

605
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,807
Whoa! Who is this one?

606
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:50,864
This is dancer.

607
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:55,097
He's a bit slow, do you see?

608
00:43:55,097 --> 00:43:57,238
Poor old dancer.

609
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:02,875
Oh. Good evening, Mrs. Walker.

610
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:06,199
Good evening...Mr. Kringle.

611
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:09,549
Nobody at school is going to believe
this one, huh?

612
00:44:09,549 --> 00:44:13,620
Well, if you have to have a babysitter,
who's better qualified?

613
00:44:15,642 --> 00:44:16,893
Yes.

614
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:07,332
Pretty, isn't it?

615
00:46:07,332 --> 00:46:10,391
There really has to be something
you want for christmas.

616
00:46:14,526 --> 00:46:17,165
I'm very good at
keeping secrets, you know.

617
00:46:18,135 --> 00:46:19,794
Come on. Tell me.

618
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:52,577
What's this?

619
00:47:06,515 --> 00:47:08,035
Gosh.

620
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:15,220
That's what I want  for christmas--

621
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:19,568
a house, a brother, and a dad.

622
00:47:19,568 --> 00:47:21,551
That's all I ever want.

623
00:47:25,562 --> 00:47:29,623
If you're really Santa Claus,
you can get it for me.

624
00:47:29,623 --> 00:47:35,133
If you can't, you're just a nice man
with a white beard like my mother says.

625
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:37,325
Oh, Susan.

626
00:47:37,325 --> 00:47:40,309
Just because every child doesn't get his
or her wish doesn't mean

627
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:42,397
There's not a Santa Claus.

628
00:47:42,397 --> 00:47:44,357
I thought you might say that.

629
00:47:45,507 --> 00:47:49,731
Did you?
Yes. Well...

630
00:47:49,731 --> 00:47:51,433
A house is a very big order--

631
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:54,002
And very expensive.

632
00:47:54,002 --> 00:47:59,526
And a baby, well a baby takes
almost a year to, uh, to, uh...

633
00:47:59,526 --> 00:48:03,067
nine months. More if the lady's late.

634
00:48:03,067 --> 00:48:05,111
Less if the baby's a preemie.

635
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:11,412
Right. And a father. I mean, uh...

636
00:48:11,412 --> 00:48:14,737
No one can give anybody a father.

637
00:48:14,737 --> 00:48:19,241
If Santa Claus really can make reindeer
fly and go up and down people's chimneys

638
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:24,469
and make millions of toys
and go around the world in one night,

639
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,649
he could get somebody a house

640
00:48:26,649 --> 00:48:31,346
and a brother...and a dad. Right?

641
00:48:33,315 --> 00:48:38,044
Right. Right. Yes. I suppose he...
he could.

642
00:48:40,723 --> 00:48:45,684
I don't think I'll ever get those things,
so it's no big deal.

643
00:48:45,684 --> 00:48:53,207
Oh. Well, um, perhaps
I could keep this paper. Could I?

644
00:48:53,207 --> 00:48:54,263
Sure.

645
00:48:54,263 --> 00:48:57,576
Well, good night, little angel.

646
00:48:57,576 --> 00:48:58,738
Good night.

647
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:06,197
Good night, Susan.

648
00:49:06,197 --> 00:49:08,055
Good night, Mr. Kringle.

649
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:16,649
A family for christmas.
I don't think so.

650
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:24,509
No, really. I mean...

651
00:49:24,509 --> 00:49:26,498
see, that wasn't so bad, huh?

652
00:49:26,498 --> 00:49:27,769
I had a great time.

653
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:31,494
You need to get out.
You need to forget work...

654
00:49:31,494 --> 00:49:34,628
- I should've listened to you earlier.
- Come out with me.

655
00:49:34,628 --> 00:49:36,858
You understand why I didn't.

656
00:49:36,858 --> 00:49:40,474
Sometimes I think I do .
Sometimes I think I don't .

657
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:44,296
Well, you are a very patient man.

658
00:49:44,296 --> 00:49:47,414
Most guys are gone
after a few months of me.

659
00:49:47,414 --> 00:49:49,619
So you admit that you're rough on men.

660
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,633
No, not just rough on men.

661
00:49:53,582 --> 00:49:57,023
Yeah. I admit it. I'm careful.

662
00:49:57,023 --> 00:50:00,917
At this point in my life, I really don't need
to be disappointed.

663
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:08,955
Do you want one of your
christmas presents early?

664
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:13,244
I got you a christmas present,
and I want to give it to you.

665
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:14,301
What is it?

666
00:50:14,301 --> 00:50:18,832
Do you want it early?

667
00:50:18,832 --> 00:50:20,086
Yes.

668
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,248
What is it?

669
00:50:33,093 --> 00:50:34,553
Open it.

670
00:50:53,337 --> 00:50:55,212
It's an engagement ring.

671
00:51:00,097 --> 00:51:07,935
If I've given you a...
false impression of this relationship,

672
00:51:07,935 --> 00:51:10,268
I'm very sorry.

673
00:51:13,675 --> 00:51:15,335
Are you serious?

674
00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:23,230
Have I ever given you any sign
that I wanted to marry you?

675
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:26,614
No.

676
00:51:26,614 --> 00:51:32,729
Then, tell me, whatever possessed you
to make a presumption?

677
00:51:32,729 --> 00:51:36,374
You know, I've done everything
I could to try to make you happy.

678
00:51:36,374 --> 00:51:38,790
I love your daughter
like she's my own.

679
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:42,124
I loved you, getting nothing in return.

680
00:51:42,124 --> 00:51:45,286
Never asking for anything in return.

681
00:51:48,034 --> 00:51:49,909
I put my faith in you.

682
00:51:53,015 --> 00:51:58,869
Well, if that's true,
then you're a fool.

683
00:52:41,622 --> 00:52:43,542
- Taxi, please
- Certainly.

684
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:57,073
Mr. Bedford.

685
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,967
Kriss.

686
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,176
How was your night as a babysitter?

687
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:03,941
Oh. Very pleasant.

688
00:53:03,941 --> 00:53:05,470
Susan's a good kid.

689
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:11,692
Yes. Delightful. Delightful.

690
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:12,952
Well, how was it?

691
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:17,187
I gave her an engagement ring.

692
00:53:17,187 --> 00:53:20,469
Ohh. Ooh!

693
00:53:22,528 --> 00:53:24,438
She didn't like it very much.

694
00:53:24,438 --> 00:53:28,203
Well, perhaps your timing
wasn't particularly good.

695
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:31,190
Oh. Not at all.

696
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:36,148
She...she's a sad sort of person, isn't she?

697
00:53:36,148 --> 00:53:39,831
It's a pity, really.
She's very kind...

698
00:53:39,831 --> 00:53:45,299
but she's terribly careful about her emotions.

699
00:53:45,299 --> 00:53:50,549
What I know about Dorey is pieced together
from fragments of a dozen conversations.

700
00:53:50,549 --> 00:53:52,353
She was married in college,

701
00:53:52,353 --> 00:53:54,529
he had a drinking problem,

702
00:53:54,529 --> 00:53:59,570
And right after Susan was born
he took off and hasn't been heard of since.

703
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:04,339
She's filled with these, these bitter thoughts.

704
00:54:04,339 --> 00:54:07,335
The worst part is she's dragging
Susan into this with her.

705
00:54:07,335 --> 00:54:11,520
Ah, yes. Well, Susan is struggling with it.

706
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,044
But I get the feeling that she does want
to believe in me, you know.

707
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:16,547
She's a good girl.

708
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:20,537
She's loyal to her mother's wishes.
I can't fault that.

709
00:54:20,537 --> 00:54:24,314
Of course, if I can't convince the mother,

710
00:54:24,314 --> 00:54:27,518
I have no hope of convincing the child.

711
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,496
The tooth fairy told me that.

712
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:37,855
Well, your cab's here, Kriss.

713
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:45,692
I always wondered what guys
who have to return engagement rings
Say to the sales clerk at the jewelry store.

714
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:50,610
Now I don't want to know.

715
00:54:52,434 --> 00:54:55,815
I'm sure in your line of work
you can find some lucky guy to give this to.

716
00:54:58,671 --> 00:54:59,913
That's very generous of you,

717
00:54:59,913 --> 00:55:05,252
but I don't think this ring will ever fit anyone
Other than Mrs. Walker.

718
00:55:05,252 --> 00:55:07,732
I'm sure you'll find somebody.

719
00:55:07,732 --> 00:55:09,475
- I'm sorry.
- It's o.k.

720
00:55:09,475 --> 00:55:11,315
I'll get over it.

721
00:55:11,315 --> 00:55:12,712
Will Susan?

722
00:55:16,882 --> 00:55:21,912
Well... I know what you want
for christmas now.

723
00:55:21,912 --> 00:55:23,765
I'll see what I can do.

724
00:55:23,765 --> 00:55:25,515
- Good night.
- Good night.

725
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:42,940
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye!

726
00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:58,653
Come on.
It's your turn to go up now.

727
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:01,729
Hello.

728
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,734
What do you want for christmas?

729
00:56:05,214 --> 00:56:07,533
Excuse me, sir.
Could you please step aside?

730
00:56:07,533 --> 00:56:10,497
This is for the children.

731
00:56:10,497 --> 00:56:12,581
Hot little helper you got here, huh, Santa?

732
00:56:15,684 --> 00:56:19,662
She the one that puts the, uh...
twinkle in your eye?

733
00:56:22,231 --> 00:56:26,425
Hey, kids, you see that guy up there?

734
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,103
He's not really Santa Claus.

735
00:56:28,103 --> 00:56:30,083
He doesn't even live at the north pole.

736
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:35,361
He lives in a nursing home on Kriss4th street!

737
00:56:35,361 --> 00:56:37,418
You know what he is?

738
00:56:37,418 --> 00:56:41,920
He's a big... Fat...Fake!

739
00:56:49,877 --> 00:56:51,145
Just a fake.

740
00:56:52,257 --> 00:56:53,972
Ho ho ho.

741
00:57:48,518 --> 00:57:50,038
Hey! Goofball!

742
00:57:50,038 --> 00:57:51,307
Huh?

743
00:57:51,307 --> 00:57:53,699
Yeah, you, numb-nuts.

744
00:57:53,699 --> 00:57:57,264
What is a guy your age playing
this game for, huh?

745
00:57:57,264 --> 00:58:00,652
I mean, are you just a lonely,
pathetic mental case?

746
00:58:00,652 --> 00:58:03,415
Or does it go a little bit deeper than that?

747
00:58:03,415 --> 00:58:05,184
Is there a darker side to this?

748
00:58:05,184 --> 00:58:08,857
Tell me something, you sorry old cripple, you.

749
00:58:08,857 --> 00:58:10,874
You got a thing for the little ones, huh?

750
00:58:10,874 --> 00:58:12,998
Huh? Huh?

751
00:58:14,092 --> 00:58:17,145
'Cause they ain't much good for
nothin' else, are they? Huh?

752
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:30,869
Stop that man! Quickly!

753
00:58:32,372 --> 00:58:33,597
Get the cane away from him.

754
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:34,975
Come on.

755
00:58:36,491 --> 00:58:38,827
I...I--I didn'tintend to injure him.

756
00:58:38,827 --> 00:58:41,116
He baited me. He provoked me.

757
00:58:41,116 --> 00:58:43,277
Save it for the cops, sir.

758
00:58:43,277 --> 00:58:44,796
He's badly hurt.

759
00:58:45,683 --> 00:58:51,281
Wait a second. You're--
you're cole's Santa Claus.

760
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:53,616
Cole's Santa Claus?

761
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:07,529
Oh...He...said the most...terrible th--Oh...

762
00:59:08,814 --> 00:59:10,401
- Get away folks, please.
- Come with us.

763
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:11,997
All right, folks.

764
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,952
- Please. Step back.
- Take it easy, mister.

765
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:30,377
You might want to clear the kids out of
the room before we read this next story.

766
00:59:30,377 --> 00:59:35,151
It appears that new york's most famous
Santa Claus has a mean streak.

767
00:59:35,151 --> 00:59:40,436
The centerpiece of c.f. Cole's big holiday
ad push is behind bars this morning--

768
00:59:40,436 --> 00:59:43,466
...plans regarding a replacement for
Mr. Kringle.

769
00:59:43,466 --> 00:59:47,524
The spokesperson did say, however,
that for at least the remainder Of today,

770
00:59:47,524 --> 00:59:50,885
there will be no Santa Claus
at the 34th street store.

771
00:59:50,885 --> 00:59:56,080
...without any apparent provocation,
struck him repeatedly with a walking stick.

772
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,706
Police arrived within moments and
arrested kringle--

773
00:59:58,706 --> 01:00:01,749
If you're planning to take your children
to the store today, take note.

774
01:00:01,749 --> 01:00:06,513
There will be no Santa Claus
at the 34th street store.

775
01:00:06,513 --> 01:00:10,147
C.f. Cole's competitors are having
the last laugh this morning.

776
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:05,117
Who wears a charming suit and
affects a jolly demeanor, you know.

777
01:01:05,117 --> 01:01:06,432
I'm a symbol.

778
01:01:06,432 --> 01:01:10,686
I'm a symbol of the human ability
to suppress the selfish

779
01:01:10,686 --> 01:01:15,760
and hateful tendencies that rule the major
part of our lives.

780
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:23,697
And if you can't accept anything on faith,
then you're doomed to a life dominated by doubt.

781
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,819
Get me Bryan bedford on the phone.

782
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,016
Bryan?

783
01:01:43,016 --> 01:01:45,370
I know. I saw the papers.

784
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:47,575
I want you to help him.

785
01:01:47,575 --> 01:01:50,597
He's at bellevue,
and I don't know what's happening,

786
01:01:50,597 --> 01:01:51,923
but he's alone,

787
01:01:51,923 --> 01:01:53,245
And he shouldn't be.

788
01:01:53,245 --> 01:01:54,920
What's cole's position?

789
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,423
Do their attorneys have an opinion?

790
01:01:56,423 --> 01:01:57,998
Oh, this isn't about cole's.

791
01:01:57,998 --> 01:02:02,794
This is about a man
who's had something very wrong done to him.

792
01:02:02,794 --> 01:02:08,784
Somebody you care about.
Somebody... you believe in.

793
01:02:32,151 --> 01:02:35,296
Your honor...
do you have a moment for ed collins?

794
01:02:35,296 --> 01:02:36,585
Send him in.

795
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,168
Thanks, colby.

796
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:41,705
How are you, eddie?

797
01:02:41,705 --> 01:02:42,820
What can I do for you?

798
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:43,728
How are you?

799
01:02:43,728 --> 01:02:46,344
Oh, just the commitment papers
for the cole Santa.

800
01:02:46,344 --> 01:02:48,882
That's a shocker, huh?

801
01:02:48,882 --> 01:02:50,302
The press is having a field day.

802
01:02:50,302 --> 01:02:52,357
"age unknown." Old man, is he?

803
01:02:52,357 --> 01:02:55,159
Very old, your honor.

804
01:02:55,159 --> 01:02:56,981
Do I have to read all this?

805
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:57,926
No. It's a slam dunk.

806
01:02:57,926 --> 01:02:59,763
Guy's out of his mind.

807
01:02:59,763 --> 01:03:01,106
We'd like it over quick.

808
01:03:02,359 --> 01:03:04,225
- "we"?
- Victor.

809
01:03:04,225 --> 01:03:06,809
- "victor"?
- Lamberg.

810
01:03:09,326 --> 01:03:11,180
Oh, yes.

811
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,326
Right there.

812
01:03:13,674 --> 01:03:18,553
Well. Justice will have to prevail,
of course.

813
01:03:20,045 --> 01:03:24,116
Oh, of course.

814
01:03:24,116 --> 01:03:27,859
Yes, justice will have to prevail...
as always.

815
01:03:29,114 --> 01:03:31,777
Money makes the world go around, eddie.

816
01:03:32,623 --> 01:03:34,958
Yes, it does, your honor, it sure does.

817
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:38,480
By the way, Mr. Lamberg wanted you
to know that he's Very well aware of

818
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,612
your re-election campaign
coming up this spring.

819
01:03:42,612 --> 01:03:45,178
Tell him I would welcome his support.

820
01:03:45,178 --> 01:03:46,412
Will do.

821
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:48,529
Come in.

822
01:03:49,694 --> 01:03:51,748
A Mr. Bedford's here to see you.

823
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:52,647
Who?

824
01:03:52,647 --> 01:03:55,109
He represents Mr. Kringle?

825
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,576
Send him in.

826
01:04:03,236 --> 01:04:06,279
Your honor, there seems to be
some undue haste in this case.

827
01:04:06,279 --> 01:04:09,926
I wish to protect my client's rights,
as I'm sure you do.

828
01:04:09,926 --> 01:04:11,498
Mr. Prosecutor, this is...

829
01:04:11,498 --> 01:04:12,722
Bryan bedford.

830
01:04:13,176 --> 01:04:14,484
Ed collins.

831
01:04:15,094 --> 01:04:19,844
If your honor please, i request a formal
hearing where i may bring witnesses.

832
01:04:19,844 --> 01:04:24,688
Sign the commitment papers now if you like,
but I'll bring in habeas corpus this afternoon.

833
01:04:30,561 --> 01:04:31,845
We'll have a hearing.

834
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:34,830
Thursday morning, 9 a.m.?

835
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:38,287
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Collins.

836
01:04:38,287 --> 01:04:39,757
Mr. Bedford.

837
01:04:46,117 --> 01:04:48,829
I thought you said the old man
didn't have an attorney.

838
01:04:48,829 --> 01:04:50,613
What's the difference?

839
01:04:50,613 --> 01:04:53,058
It'll be a hearing, not a jury trial.

840
01:04:53,058 --> 01:04:55,165
You're the only one
that has to be convinced.

841
01:04:59,532 --> 01:05:01,016
Have a good day, judge.

842
01:05:03,607 --> 01:05:05,736
Want to know somethin', mister?

843
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,371
I don't believe it.

844
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:09,744
This guy ain't dangerous.

845
01:05:09,744 --> 01:05:13,915
He may be off his rails a little bit,
but he ain't no thug.

846
01:05:13,915 --> 01:05:17,942
And if he wants to call himself santy Claus...
then god bless him.

847
01:05:34,786 --> 01:05:36,179
Hello, Kriss.

848
01:05:38,163 --> 01:05:41,022
Hello, Mr. Bedford.

849
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:45,371
What brings you out
on a miserable day like this?

850
01:05:48,722 --> 01:05:50,271
A friend in need.

851
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:54,444
Hmm.

852
01:05:57,691 --> 01:06:00,510
You failed your mental exam
on purpose, didn't you?

853
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:07,273
Huh. Why would I... do a thing like that?

854
01:06:08,244 --> 01:06:10,353
I don't know.

855
01:06:10,353 --> 01:06:12,547
Maybe you've served people long enough.

856
01:06:13,962 --> 01:06:16,067
Maybe you've given all you have to give.

857
01:06:18,112 --> 01:06:19,113
No.

858
01:06:19,113 --> 01:06:21,096
Then why did you do it?

859
01:06:21,096 --> 01:06:23,219
The charges against you were dropped.

860
01:06:23,219 --> 01:06:26,323
The man you hit suffered no injury.

861
01:06:26,323 --> 01:06:29,093
You could've been out of here
if you passed your exam.

862
01:06:31,065 --> 01:06:33,171
I disgraced myself.

863
01:06:44,969 --> 01:06:47,898
I read your transcript, Kriss.

864
01:06:47,898 --> 01:06:50,308
You defended your honor.

865
01:06:50,308 --> 01:06:52,121
You stood up for the dignity of every child.

866
01:06:52,121 --> 01:06:56,602
That isn't a disgrace.
That's decency.

867
01:07:00,422 --> 01:07:03,502
If I'm dismissed as a crazy old man...

868
01:07:03,502 --> 01:07:07,060
then the good name of...
Santa Claus is spared.

869
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,052
That isn't true.

870
01:07:09,052 --> 01:07:12,563
If not for you, there is no Santa Claus.

871
01:07:12,563 --> 01:07:14,457
You are him.

872
01:07:14,457 --> 01:07:17,691
Crazy or not, here or gone, you're Santa Claus.

873
01:07:17,691 --> 01:07:20,070
Only if the children believe that.

874
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:24,183
And what kind of Santa Claus
were they believing in, anyway?

875
01:07:24,183 --> 01:07:29,042
They can't look to me anymore,
not after knowing what happened
the other night.

876
01:07:29,042 --> 01:07:31,854
Well, think about the other night.

877
01:07:31,854 --> 01:07:34,650
A man was there to photograph the incident.

878
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:37,574
The man you hit was the man you replaced.

879
01:07:37,574 --> 01:07:40,107
The cops told me this, Kriss.

880
01:07:40,107 --> 01:07:42,195
The cops believe in you.

881
01:07:42,195 --> 01:07:43,876
A lot of people do.

882
01:07:43,876 --> 01:07:46,207
More will when we're finished.

883
01:07:46,207 --> 01:07:48,198
Finished with what?

884
01:07:48,198 --> 01:07:50,882
There's a hearing Thursday to decide
if you're to be committed.

885
01:07:50,882 --> 01:07:52,786
I'm going to defend you.

886
01:07:52,786 --> 01:07:57,060
We'll prove that there is Santa Claus
and that you're him.

887
01:08:05,836 --> 01:08:07,426
I'm ready, counselor.

888
01:08:09,657 --> 01:08:14,320
Now, we have a few days to distance
ourselves from this...scandal

889
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,725
And restart our advertising.

890
01:08:17,725 --> 01:08:20,420
Uh, Mrs. Walker, we are in conference.

891
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:22,617
I have just read your press release.

892
01:08:22,617 --> 01:08:25,539
You are all such a bunch of cowards.

893
01:08:25,539 --> 01:08:27,655
You really don't deserve to run the store.

894
01:08:27,655 --> 01:08:30,531
You are entirely out of line, Mrs. Walker.

895
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:35,678
We have spent millions telling people
that we are the store that cares.

896
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:38,189
Well, what is it that we care about?

897
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:40,332
Profits? Ourselves?

898
01:08:40,332 --> 01:08:41,236
Our jobs?

899
01:08:41,236 --> 01:08:44,416
Well, what about one of our
own who needs us now?

900
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,381
And what--what am I to do?

901
01:08:52,381 --> 01:08:56,528
The public perception of Kriss is that
he's out of his mind.

902
01:08:56,528 --> 01:08:57,335
He's dangerous.

903
01:08:57,335 --> 01:08:59,473
We have to change that.

904
01:09:01,332 --> 01:09:05,020
If...we stand with Kriss...

905
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:08,552
If we challenge the rumors
and the scandal sheets,

906
01:09:08,552 --> 01:09:11,773
if we force the truth, we'll win.

907
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:18,051
Now, he's going into court with...
the best attorney in the city.

908
01:09:18,051 --> 01:09:23,050
And he's going to prove
that Kriss is not...crazy.

909
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,091
For the sake of the whole company...

910
01:09:30,091 --> 01:09:37,023
I think that all of you should decide
about whether or not You...

911
01:09:37,023 --> 01:09:39,104
believe in Santa Claus.

912
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:48,701
Bring up two. Go.

913
01:09:48,701 --> 01:09:50,701
For the last 75 years,

914
01:09:50,701 --> 01:09:56,014
cole's has invited Santa Claus
to meet and greet
The children of new york city

915
01:09:56,014 --> 01:09:58,796
in our 34th street store.

916
01:09:58,796 --> 01:10:03,013
Cole's believes in Santa Claus...

917
01:10:03,013 --> 01:10:05,616
and we will stand by him.

918
01:10:05,616 --> 01:10:10,338
He has done nothing but serve the children
and the families of new york city..

919
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:19,742
And the world. We invite you to join with us
and ask yourself this one simple question--

920
01:10:19,742 --> 01:10:21,721
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

921
01:11:33,204 --> 01:11:36,183
I have to confess, I'm a bit uneasy.

922
01:11:36,183 --> 01:11:39,624
You'll be fine.
All you have to do is tell the truth.

923
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:44,181
Who's that character in the gray suit?

924
01:11:45,755 --> 01:11:47,439
That's the prosecutor.

925
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:51,657
Oh. Anything I should know about him?

926
01:11:51,657 --> 01:11:53,988
Yeah. He doesn't believe in
Santa Claus.

927
01:11:55,456 --> 01:12:00,095
All rise!
Oyez, oyez.

928
01:12:00,095 --> 01:12:02,807
Let all those who have business
before this court come forward.

929
01:12:02,807 --> 01:12:06,918
The honorable justice harper presiding.
Draw near, and ye shall be heard.

930
01:12:09,222 --> 01:12:11,185
You may sit.

931
01:12:14,056 --> 01:12:17,896
Your honor, in the matter of Kriss kringle,
the commitment papers are on your desk.

932
01:12:17,896 --> 01:12:21,213
May I call the first witness?

933
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:26,155
Mr. Kringle,
would you please take the stand?

934
01:12:38,978 --> 01:12:41,412
Good morning, judge.

935
01:12:41,412 --> 01:12:44,180
How's that grandson of yours?

936
01:12:46,073 --> 01:12:47,386
The parade.

937
01:12:47,386 --> 01:12:50,682
He thought I looked like Santa Claus.

938
01:12:50,682 --> 01:12:54,302
Oh. Oh, yes.

939
01:12:54,302 --> 01:12:57,884
You swear to tell the whole truth,
so help you god?

940
01:12:57,884 --> 01:13:00,719
Yes. Uh, don't i put my hand on a bible?

941
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,294
No, sir, you don't.

942
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:06,524
Oh. Well, then,
I'll put my hand over my heart instead.

943
01:13:06,524 --> 01:13:08,985
I do . I do .

944
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:10,485
Sit down, please.

945
01:13:21,304 --> 01:13:22,659
What is your name?

946
01:13:24,454 --> 01:13:26,929
I'm so sorry.
I didn'tintroduce myself.

947
01:13:26,929 --> 01:13:29,184
I do beg your pardon.
You're Mr. Collins.

948
01:13:29,184 --> 01:13:31,133
I'm Mr. Kringle. Kriss kringle.

949
01:13:33,384 --> 01:13:34,957
Order.

950
01:13:37,503 --> 01:13:38,844
Kriss kringle.

951
01:13:38,844 --> 01:13:42,036
It's double "k."

952
01:13:42,036 --> 01:13:43,969
Tell me, Mr. Kringle,

953
01:13:43,969 --> 01:13:46,342
do you believe that you are Santa Claus?

954
01:13:47,454 --> 01:13:49,743
Well, would I be here if I didn't?

955
01:13:49,743 --> 01:13:52,329
Just yes or no, Mr. Kringle.

956
01:13:52,329 --> 01:13:54,566
Do you believe that you are Santa Claus?

957
01:13:56,655 --> 01:13:57,977
Yes, of course.

958
01:14:03,502 --> 01:14:07,157
Santa Claus. Hmm.

959
01:14:08,606 --> 01:14:10,620
State rests, your honor.

960
01:14:13,194 --> 01:14:16,141
Mr. Bedford, do you wish to
cross-examine the witness?

961
01:14:16,141 --> 01:14:18,265
No further questions, your honor.

962
01:14:18,265 --> 01:14:20,071
Uh, you may step down, Mr. Kringle.

963
01:14:20,071 --> 01:14:21,255
Oh. Thank you.

964
01:14:21,255 --> 01:14:22,565
Mr. Bedford.

965
01:14:22,565 --> 01:14:27,382
In view of your client's statement,
do you still wish to offer a defense?

966
01:14:27,382 --> 01:14:28,742
Yes, your honor.

967
01:14:28,742 --> 01:14:31,248
I should like to call my first witness.

968
01:14:39,754 --> 01:14:41,087
Can you tell us your name?

969
01:14:41,087 --> 01:14:43,659
My name is Daniel lowry.

970
01:14:45,252 --> 01:14:48,079
And what'd you get for christmas
last year, Daniel?

971
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:51,264
Um... a bike and, um...

972
01:14:51,264 --> 01:14:52,704
And who gave you the bike?

973
01:14:52,704 --> 01:14:54,552
Him.

974
01:14:54,552 --> 01:14:55,924
What's his name?

975
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:57,340
Santa Claus.

976
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:58,731
You're sure he's Santa Claus?

977
01:14:58,731 --> 01:14:59,694
Yep.

978
01:14:59,694 --> 01:15:00,753
How can you be sure?

979
01:15:00,753 --> 01:15:03,150
'Cause he looks like Santa Claus.

980
01:15:05,365 --> 01:15:06,616
Any other reasons?

981
01:15:06,616 --> 01:15:09,398
Oh, he's very nice...

982
01:15:09,398 --> 01:15:14,151
And he works at cole's,
and he's got elves.

983
01:15:14,151 --> 01:15:16,655
Well, tell me something, Daniel...

984
01:15:16,655 --> 01:15:18,755
could that man be Santa Claus?

985
01:15:18,755 --> 01:15:19,645
Nope.

986
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:20,782
Why not?

987
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:23,960
'Cause Santa don't got a grumpy face.

988
01:15:26,585 --> 01:15:27,836
Order.

989
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,671
No further questions.

990
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:39,451
Um...Mr. Collins, do you wish to
cross-examine the witness?

991
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:41,647
No, your honor. No questions.

992
01:15:43,033 --> 01:15:45,567
Do I have to go to jail now?

993
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:50,203
No. You can go back to your seat.

994
01:15:50,203 --> 01:15:51,505
Your honor...

995
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:54,857
I should like to call my next witness.

996
01:15:54,857 --> 01:15:56,946
Mrs. Rebecca collins.

997
01:16:05,118 --> 01:16:06,371
Order.

998
01:16:17,688 --> 01:16:21,208
You swear to tell the whole truth,
so help you god?

999
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:21,928
I do .

1000
01:16:21,928 --> 01:16:23,405
Sit down, please.

1001
01:16:26,154 --> 01:16:29,356
Do you have children, Mrs. Collins?

1002
01:16:29,356 --> 01:16:30,719
I have two.

1003
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:31,794
How old are they?

1004
01:16:31,794 --> 01:16:33,505
4 and 7.

1005
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:34,616
Do they believe in Santa Claus?

1006
01:16:34,616 --> 01:16:36,777
I object, your honor.

1007
01:16:36,777 --> 01:16:38,422
On what grounds, Mr. Collins?

1008
01:16:38,422 --> 01:16:40,274
The witness is my wife.

1009
01:16:40,274 --> 01:16:44,336
Mr. Bedford is deliberately harassing her
solely in order to embarrass me

1010
01:16:44,336 --> 01:16:47,044
and expose private matters to the court.

1011
01:16:47,044 --> 01:16:49,558
Your honor, I'm merely attempting to
establish that Mr. Collins,

1012
01:16:49,558 --> 01:16:53,121
Like so many others, has taught
his children that there is a Santa Claus.

1013
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:56,967
Objection overruled.
You may continue.

1014
01:16:56,967 --> 01:16:59,006
Thank you, your honor.

1015
01:16:59,006 --> 01:17:03,669
Mrs. Collins, do your children
believe in Santa Claus?

1016
01:17:03,669 --> 01:17:04,688
Yes.

1017
01:17:04,688 --> 01:17:06,289
Did they come to this belief naturally,

1018
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:09,826
or were they introduced to it
by a family member?

1019
01:17:09,826 --> 01:17:12,080
By a family member.

1020
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,014
- Yourself.
- Yes.

1021
01:17:14,014 --> 01:17:15,672
And your husband.

1022
01:17:20,037 --> 01:17:21,590
Uh...yes.

1023
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:26,169
Your husband told your children
that there is a Santa Claus?

1024
01:17:26,169 --> 01:17:27,413
Yes.

1025
01:17:29,484 --> 01:17:31,485
On more than one occasion?

1026
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:34,356
Uh...y-yeah.

1027
01:17:34,356 --> 01:17:34,949
Mrs. Collins,

1028
01:17:34,949 --> 01:17:39,577
have you taken your children to see
a department store Santa Claus this year?

1029
01:17:39,577 --> 01:17:40,455
Yes, we have.

1030
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:41,932
- Where?
- At cole's.

1031
01:17:41,932 --> 01:17:43,969
So your children have met Mr. Kringle.

1032
01:17:43,969 --> 01:17:45,208
Oh, yes.

1033
01:17:47,031 --> 01:17:49,716
And they accepted him as Santa Claus.

1034
01:17:49,716 --> 01:17:50,367
Yes.

1035
01:17:50,367 --> 01:17:53,289
Did the question of Mr. Kringle's
authenticity arise at any time

1036
01:17:53,289 --> 01:17:56,034
Before or after your children met him?

1037
01:17:56,034 --> 01:17:58,416
Uh...yes. It was after.

1038
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:01,954
And did you deny...or confirm...

1039
01:18:01,954 --> 01:18:04,362
that Mr. Kringle is the real Santa Claus?

1040
01:18:04,362 --> 01:18:06,513
You're under oath now, Mrs. Collins.

1041
01:18:15,071 --> 01:18:18,997
U-um...w-well, actually, my--my husband

1042
01:18:18,997 --> 01:18:21,190
confirmed that he's the real Santa Claus.

1043
01:18:27,052 --> 01:18:29,373
No further questions, your honor.

1044
01:18:29,373 --> 01:18:32,056
Thank you, Mrs. Collins.

1045
01:18:32,056 --> 01:18:33,488
Merry christmas.

1046
01:18:34,273 --> 01:18:38,912
Mr. Collins...do you wish to
cross-examine...your wife?

1047
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,090
I object, your honor.
This is irrelevant, immaterial,

1048
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:47,178
and absolutely ridiculous.

1049
01:18:47,178 --> 01:18:49,445
Mr. Bedford is making
a mockery of this court.

1050
01:18:49,445 --> 01:18:53,011
He's not even established that
there's such a person as Santa Claus.

1051
01:18:53,011 --> 01:18:55,208
Your honor, I would ask Mr. Collins

1052
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:59,169
if he could offer any proof that there
Is no Santa Claus.

1053
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:03,200
Your honor, I'd like a recess until tomorrow

1054
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:08,328
so that I might Adequately prepare
to meet Mr. Bedford's challenge.

1055
01:19:09,275 --> 01:19:11,413
Mr. Bedford, do you have any objections?

1056
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,593
No, your honor.

1057
01:19:15,147 --> 01:19:19,623
This court stands in recess
until 9:00 tomorrow morning.

1058
01:19:30,484 --> 01:19:32,978
I knew if I got him angry enough,
he'd take the offensive.

1059
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:36,185
There's no way in a court of law
we can prove Santa Claus exists

1060
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:37,366
or that you're him.

1061
01:19:37,366 --> 01:19:41,605
Haven't you given him the opportunity
of proving that I don't exist?

1062
01:19:41,605 --> 01:19:44,849
Exactly. You see, he'll go too far.

1063
01:19:44,849 --> 01:19:48,216
Our best defense is to let collins
hang himself.

1064
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:51,458
Oh. Oh, I see.

1065
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,270
But you have to promise me one thing.

1066
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:54,578
You'll speak only when I tell you to.

1067
01:19:54,578 --> 01:19:55,955
You have my word.

1068
01:19:55,955 --> 01:19:57,209
Good. Come on.

1069
01:20:20,594 --> 01:20:23,677
I, um...I just wanted to thank you

1070
01:20:23,677 --> 01:20:26,993
for everything that you're doing for Kriss.

1071
01:20:26,993 --> 01:20:30,094
I was in the gallery.
I don't know if you saw me.

1072
01:20:30,094 --> 01:20:31,864
I still have a long way to go.

1073
01:20:31,864 --> 01:20:35,943
I think you'll do it.
I hope you will.

1074
01:20:35,943 --> 01:20:37,996
I have a few tricks up my sleeve.

1075
01:20:44,884 --> 01:20:51,690
About... last week...
I'm sorry.

1076
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:59,282
I mean it. I'm really, really sorry.
I was...just...

1077
01:20:59,282 --> 01:21:00,801
Scared?

1078
01:21:05,451 --> 01:21:06,738
Yes.

1079
01:21:08,198 --> 01:21:12,362
Well...no permanent damage.

1080
01:21:18,584 --> 01:21:22,049
- Well, I'd...
- I have to pick Susan up from school.

1081
01:21:22,049 --> 01:21:22,974
Oh, how's she doing?

1082
01:21:22,974 --> 01:21:24,632
She's good. She's good.

1083
01:21:24,632 --> 01:21:27,585
I think she...misses you.

1084
01:21:30,937 --> 01:21:32,718
Tell her I said hello.

1085
01:21:37,954 --> 01:21:39,331
Bye.

1086
01:21:49,268 --> 01:21:51,002
Oh, indeed, there was.

1087
01:21:51,002 --> 01:21:53,969
Saint nicholas, otherwise known as
Santa Claus,

1088
01:21:53,969 --> 01:21:58,224
was a fourth century
Bishop in myra, lycia--asia minor.

1089
01:21:58,224 --> 01:22:02,356
Uh, dr. Hunter, what is the church's
position on saint nicholas?

1090
01:22:02,356 --> 01:22:04,019
He's a recognized saint.

1091
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:06,430
Yes, but isn't it true that in 1969,

1092
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:12,770
pope paul vi eliminated the official
celebration of the feast day of saint nicholas?

1093
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:14,148
That's correct.

1094
01:22:14,148 --> 01:22:17,279
Uh, it was made an optional memorial day.

1095
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:19,668
They downgraded him.

1096
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:23,996
In essence, the church walked away
from saint nicholas.

1097
01:22:23,996 --> 01:22:26,601
Doesn't it also stand to reason
that they would walk away

1098
01:22:26,601 --> 01:22:32,671
From the derivative, diluted,
secular figure of Santa Claus?

1099
01:22:32,671 --> 01:22:35,076
I...presume so.

1100
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:40,269
Thank you...Dr. Hunter.

1101
01:22:40,269 --> 01:22:43,864
But the church has not made it clear
what its pos--

1102
01:22:45,865 --> 01:22:47,705
No further questions.

1103
01:22:49,646 --> 01:22:51,085
It's all right, Kriss.

1104
01:22:51,085 --> 01:22:53,601
He's just trying to get under your skin.

1105
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:56,888
Colonel.
Have you ever been to the north pole?

1106
01:22:56,888 --> 01:23:00,578
Yes, sir.
In 1972 and again in 1984.

1107
01:23:00,578 --> 01:23:02,528
Did you explore the region?

1108
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,751
Extensively.

1109
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:06,291
Did you ever find
any evidence of dwellings...

1110
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:09,570
animal pens, barns, workshops?

1111
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:11,498
No, sir.

1112
01:23:11,498 --> 01:23:13,517
No evidence whatsoever?

1113
01:23:13,517 --> 01:23:14,759
None, sir.

1114
01:23:15,373 --> 01:23:16,841
Tell me something, colonel.

1115
01:23:16,841 --> 01:23:21,082
In your opinion, would it be possible
for an individual Like, uh,

1116
01:23:21,082 --> 01:23:22,768
Mr. Kringle over there

1117
01:23:22,768 --> 01:23:26,118
to create a settlement in that
Inhospitable region

1118
01:23:26,118 --> 01:23:28,842
large enough to manufacture
at least one toy

1119
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:34,049
For each and every one of the earth's
1.7 billion children?

1120
01:23:34,049 --> 01:23:35,383
No, sir.

1121
01:23:35,383 --> 01:23:39,106
There isn't any way in which the gentleman
can have seen my workshops.

1122
01:23:39,106 --> 01:23:41,034
They're invisible.

1123
01:23:42,051 --> 01:23:43,136
Kriss, sit down, please.

1124
01:23:43,136 --> 01:23:46,285
But Mr. Collins is completely mistaken.

1125
01:23:46,285 --> 01:23:49,102
My workshops don't exist
in the physical world.

1126
01:23:49,102 --> 01:23:51,018
They're in the dream world.

1127
01:23:51,018 --> 01:23:52,999
Let me be the lawyer.

1128
01:23:57,456 --> 01:24:00,463
I always thought that was
completely understood.

1129
01:24:01,308 --> 01:24:05,073
Your honor...with the court's permission,
I'd like to call my next witness.

1130
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:24,081
Mr. Collins, what is this?

1131
01:24:24,081 --> 01:24:26,508
This...is a reindeer, your honor.

1132
01:24:28,048 --> 01:24:30,783
I know, but what's it doing
in my courtroom?

1133
01:24:30,783 --> 01:24:35,040
I'd like the court to see Mr. Kringle
make the reindeer fly.

1134
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,235
He's baiting you.
He wants you to lose your temper.

1135
01:24:37,235 --> 01:24:39,612
He wants you to act crazy.
Remember that.

1136
01:24:39,612 --> 01:24:42,740
Mr. Kringle...we're waiting.

1137
01:24:45,764 --> 01:24:48,690
Well...Isn't it.

1138
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:56,604
Well, I would greatly like to oblige Mr. Collins,
but I cannot make this reindeer fly.

1139
01:24:56,604 --> 01:24:58,005
I didn't think so.

1140
01:24:58,005 --> 01:25:00,392
He only flies on christmas eve.

1141
01:25:05,591 --> 01:25:08,480
Yes. Of course.
No further questions, your honor.

1142
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,837
Then would somebody please remove
the witnes--

1143
01:25:11,837 --> 01:25:14,556
the animal from the courtroom?

1144
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:18,863
Your honor, the state of new york
has no desire in laying waste

1145
01:25:18,863 --> 01:25:22,509
to a popular myth,
but this case is not about mythology.

1146
01:25:22,509 --> 01:25:27,633
It's about the mental competency of a man--
that man Kriss kringle.

1147
01:25:27,633 --> 01:25:30,256
Everyone in this courtroom,

1148
01:25:30,256 --> 01:25:33,160
if they were entirely honest
with themselves,

1149
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,775
Would have to conclude based on
the evidence that Mr. Kringle,

1150
01:25:36,775 --> 01:25:39,536
regrettably, is insane.

1151
01:25:41,288 --> 01:25:44,922
As a sworn guardian of the laws
of the state of new york,

1152
01:25:44,922 --> 01:25:47,186
As a citizen and a father,

1153
01:25:47,186 --> 01:25:50,038
it is my wish that Mr. Kringle,

1154
01:25:50,038 --> 01:25:52,679
Who masquerades as Santa Claus,

1155
01:25:52,679 --> 01:25:57,200
a figure of benevolence
And generosity,

1156
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,857
but who does so solely for profit--

1157
01:25:59,857 --> 01:26:02,148
That's not true!

1158
01:26:02,148 --> 01:26:03,088
Your honor.

1159
01:26:04,487 --> 01:26:08,107
Mr. Kringle will refrain from comment,
or he will be removed from the courtroom.

1160
01:26:08,107 --> 01:26:11,108
Sit down. Sit down, Kriss.

1161
01:26:11,108 --> 01:26:12,301
Your honor,

1162
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:16,317
I was not aware that cole's department
store was a charitable Institution.

1163
01:26:16,317 --> 01:26:20,990
If it is, I'm more than willing to apologize
to the court and to Mr. Kringle.

1164
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:25,201
I didn'tthink so, your honor.

1165
01:26:25,201 --> 01:26:27,906
As I was saying before I was
so rudely interrupted,

1166
01:26:27,906 --> 01:26:35,621
it is my wish that Mr. Kringle be placed
under the care of the state

1167
01:26:35,621 --> 01:26:41,026
so that the children of new york
will no longer be put at risk.

1168
01:26:42,459 --> 01:26:44,744
Hey, you big jerk!

1169
01:26:44,744 --> 01:26:47,153
Mr. Kringle's the nicest man in the world!

1170
01:26:47,153 --> 01:26:49,626
He'd never hurt anybody!

1171
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:53,464
Order!
Order!

1172
01:26:53,464 --> 01:26:57,599
- Sit down!
- Order! Order!

1173
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:02,103
I have nothing further to say, your honor.

1174
01:27:02,103 --> 01:27:04,454
Kriss, sit down. We're almost through.

1175
01:27:04,454 --> 01:27:06,595
Honey, it's o.k.

1176
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:13,234
Mr. Bedford...do you wish
to make a closing statement?

1177
01:27:17,081 --> 01:27:20,954
Your honor,
a lot of people believe in Mr. Kringle,

1178
01:27:20,954 --> 01:27:24,747
including millions of children.

1179
01:27:24,747 --> 01:27:31,044
If you rule against him, you won't destroy
anyone's belief, just the man they believe in.

1180
01:27:31,044 --> 01:27:35,792
Mr. Kringle is not concerned for himself.
If he was, he wouldn't be here.

1181
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:40,418
He is in this regrettable position
because he is willing to sacrifice himself

1182
01:27:40,418 --> 01:27:47,148
for children to create in their minds
a world far better than the one we've made for them.

1183
01:27:47,148 --> 01:27:50,797
If this is, as Mr. Collins suggests,
a masquerade,

1184
01:27:50,797 --> 01:27:56,683
then Mr. Kringle is eager to forfeit his

1185
01:27:56,683 --> 01:27:59,361
freedom to preserve that masquerade,
To subject himself to prosecution,

1186
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:02,943
to protect the children's Right to believe.

1187
01:28:06,133 --> 01:28:11,463
If this court finds that Mr. Kringle
is not who he says he is,

1188
01:28:11,463 --> 01:28:16,267
that there is no Santa Clause, then I
would ask the court to judge which is worse--

1189
01:28:16,267 --> 01:28:23,294
A lie that draws a smile,
or a truth...

1190
01:28:23,294 --> 01:28:25,486
that draws a tear?

1191
01:28:32,941 --> 01:28:34,423
I rest my case.

1192
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:44,413
I shall render my opinion on this matter
at 12:00 noon tomorrow.

1193
01:28:46,484 --> 01:28:49,212
Until that time, this court stands in recess.

1194
01:29:06,189 --> 01:29:07,353
Hello, judge.

1195
01:29:08,659 --> 01:29:10,978
I appreciate your waiting for me.

1196
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:11,954
Sit down.

1197
01:29:17,205 --> 01:29:19,125
How did I get on this case?

1198
01:29:21,553 --> 01:29:24,178
I don't want to rule against your client,

1199
01:29:24,178 --> 01:29:28,198
but I can't see how, given the facts,

1200
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:30,374
I can do otherwise.

1201
01:29:30,374 --> 01:29:34,605
A man who believes himself to be someone
he isn't is by definition disturbed.

1202
01:29:34,605 --> 01:29:38,203
He isn't dangerous.
He isn't a threat.

1203
01:29:38,203 --> 01:29:41,031
I can't sit up on that bench

1204
01:29:41,031 --> 01:29:45,996
as a representative of the state of new york
And declare that there is a Santa Claus.

1205
01:29:45,996 --> 01:29:50,277
I can't make that argument,
much as I'd like to.

1206
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,968
Believe me, Mr. Bedford,

1207
01:29:54,968 --> 01:29:57,393
if I had a way out of this,

1208
01:29:57,393 --> 01:30:01,540
I'd take it.
I'm sorry.

1209
01:30:04,278 --> 01:30:06,233
It's all about money, isn't it?

1210
01:30:12,568 --> 01:30:15,346
You know what destroyed Kriss kringle?

1211
01:30:15,346 --> 01:30:19,474
Power, greed, and this.

1212
01:30:22,934 --> 01:30:25,042
Anger and recrimination may
soothe your soul,

1213
01:30:25,042 --> 01:30:27,414
but it won't help Mr. Kringle.

1214
01:30:27,414 --> 01:30:32,591
He doesn't need a bitter epilogue
from his attorney.

1215
01:30:32,591 --> 01:30:34,109
He needs a miracle.

1216
01:32:09,594 --> 01:32:10,863
You may sit.

1217
01:32:18,017 --> 01:32:23,200
Ahem. Having heard the evidence
in the matter of Kriss kringle,

1218
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:27,524
I, judge henry harper, a representative
of the state of new york,

1219
01:32:27,524 --> 01:32:30,910
Must regrettably rule on this day,

1220
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:35,104
the 24th of december, in the year...

1221
01:32:41,331 --> 01:32:44,397
Would it please the court
if i gave you your christmas card?

1222
01:32:44,397 --> 01:32:49,656
I probably won't see you again unless
I get arrested, which is very unlikely,

1223
01:32:49,656 --> 01:32:54,261
Since it's christmas eve and I'm going
to bed uncharacteristically early.

1224
01:33:00,025 --> 01:33:01,948
Thank you very much, young lady.

1225
01:33:01,948 --> 01:33:03,808
You're entirely welcome.

1226
01:33:03,808 --> 01:33:08,349
And, uh...Merry christmas.

1227
01:33:08,349 --> 01:33:10,276
Merry christmas to you.

1228
01:33:18,536 --> 01:33:20,357
What are you doing?

1229
01:33:59,886 --> 01:34:01,174
Merry christmas

1230
01:34:07,666 --> 01:34:09,396
I'm not going to be needing that.

1231
01:34:10,972 --> 01:34:12,713
The young lady who just
approached the bench

1232
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:15,564
presented me with
thi christmas card and this.

1233
01:34:15,564 --> 01:34:17,794
It's a $1.00 bill.

1234
01:34:17,794 --> 01:34:20,073
It's going to be returned to her shortly,

1235
01:34:20,073 --> 01:34:22,828
but by presenting me With this bill,

1236
01:34:22,828 --> 01:34:27,829
she reminded me that it's issued by
the treasury of the united states of America.

1237
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:30,573
And it's backed by the government,

1238
01:34:30,573 --> 01:34:34,688
and the people,
of the united states of America.

1239
01:34:37,202 --> 01:34:38,756
Upon inspection of the article,

1240
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:43,364
you will see the words, "in god we trust."

1241
01:34:43,364 --> 01:34:46,082
We're not here to prove that god exists,

1242
01:34:46,082 --> 01:34:48,247
but we are here to prove
That a being

1243
01:34:48,247 --> 01:34:53,994
just as invisible and
yet just as present exists.

1244
01:34:53,994 --> 01:34:55,968
Federal government puts its trust in god.

1245
01:34:55,968 --> 01:34:58,571
It does so on faith and faith alone.

1246
01:34:58,571 --> 01:35:01,368
It's the will of the people that guides
the government.

1247
01:35:01,368 --> 01:35:04,518
And it is and was their collective faith

1248
01:35:04,518 --> 01:35:08,770
in a greater being that gave
And gives cause to this bill's inscription.

1249
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:12,514
Now, if the government of the united
states can issue its currency

1250
01:35:12,514 --> 01:35:16,755
bearing a declaration of
trust in god without demanding

1251
01:35:16,755 --> 01:35:23,332
physical evidence of the existence
or the nonexistence of a greater being,

1252
01:35:23,332 --> 01:35:25,420
then the state of new york,

1253
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:31,678
by a similar demonstration of
the collective faith of its people,

1254
01:35:31,678 --> 01:35:35,679
can accept and acknowledge
that Santa Claus does exist,

1255
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:39,221
and he exists In the person
of Kriss kringle!

1256
01:35:46,638 --> 01:35:48,014
Case dismissed.

1257
01:35:51,982 --> 01:35:55,276
Case dismissed!
Santa Claus wins!

1258
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:10,205
All charges have been dropped.
Kriss kringle is free.

1259
01:36:10,205 --> 01:36:11,664
Hey!

1260
01:36:11,664 --> 01:36:13,516
- How about that.
- Yes!

1261
01:36:17,858 --> 01:36:18,898
You're right, Kriss.

1262
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:21,914
- It's all about the children.
- Yes.

1263
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:24,627
Congratulations, counselor.

1264
01:36:24,627 --> 01:36:25,785
Thank you.

1265
01:36:27,127 --> 01:36:28,718
Merry christmas, Mr. Kringle.

1266
01:36:28,718 --> 01:36:30,694
Merry christmas to you, Mr. Collins.

1267
01:36:30,694 --> 01:36:31,797
Thank you.

1268
01:36:33,797 --> 01:36:37,025
Uh, my children...

1269
01:36:37,025 --> 01:36:39,952
wanted me to remind you to stop by
the house tonight.

1270
01:36:39,952 --> 01:36:42,334
I won't forget. I promise.

1271
01:36:42,334 --> 01:36:45,873
We live in stanford--31 Shellhammer
bromton road, the big white house.

1272
01:36:45,873 --> 01:36:49,133
Yes. I know it well.

1273
01:36:49,133 --> 01:36:51,055
Yeah. Well...

1274
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:52,931
anyway, merry christmas.

1275
01:36:52,931 --> 01:36:55,525
Oh, uh, Mr. Collins,

1276
01:36:55,525 --> 01:36:58,892
I hope you've taken down that
old television antenna.

1277
01:36:58,892 --> 01:37:02,112
I ripped my pants on it last year.

1278
01:37:10,932 --> 01:37:13,642
Well, Kriss, you're free.

1279
01:37:13,642 --> 01:37:15,077
You made a believer out of everybody.

1280
01:37:15,077 --> 01:37:19,305
Oh, no. Not everybody.
There are still a few I have to convince.

1281
01:37:19,305 --> 01:37:21,049
One in particular.

1282
01:37:21,049 --> 01:37:22,371
Excuse me.

1283
01:37:23,412 --> 01:37:24,526
Way to go, Bryan.

1284
01:37:24,526 --> 01:37:25,917
I'm so happy for you.

1285
01:37:25,917 --> 01:37:27,702
Thank you very much, Mrs. Walker.

1286
01:37:27,702 --> 01:37:29,717
You did a great job, sweetie.

1287
01:37:29,717 --> 01:37:31,560
You kicked that guy's bottom.

1288
01:37:34,341 --> 01:37:36,683
Well, she saved the day.

1289
01:37:40,725 --> 01:37:43,240
Congratulations, Bryan.

1290
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:44,676
Thank you, Dorey.

1291
01:37:50,049 --> 01:37:51,679
Have a merry christmas.

1292
01:37:53,042 --> 01:37:54,251
You, too.

1293
01:37:57,992 --> 01:38:00,398
Well, I'll let you go.

1294
01:38:01,279 --> 01:38:03,261
Merry christmas and good luck.

1295
01:38:03,261 --> 01:38:06,005
Merry christmas, Mrs. Walker.

1296
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:09,301
And a merry christmas to you, young lady.

1297
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:11,370
And thank you very much.

1298
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:13,402
Merry christmas, Mr. Kringle.

1299
01:38:13,402 --> 01:38:15,204
Merry christmas, Bryan.

1300
01:38:31,442 --> 01:38:34,683
Again, thank you so much.

1301
01:38:34,683 --> 01:38:37,428
I shall never forget you.

1302
01:38:37,428 --> 01:38:40,262
And in all my troubles past

1303
01:38:40,262 --> 01:38:43,241
and all my troubles yet to come,

1304
01:38:43,241 --> 01:38:45,487
I'll never find a better friend.

1305
01:38:48,286 --> 01:38:52,916
Thank you, Kriss.
Merry christmas.

1306
01:38:56,497 --> 01:38:58,955
Merry christmas to you, Bryan.

1307
01:39:04,156 --> 01:39:06,046
Hey, you want to share a cab home?

1308
01:39:07,379 --> 01:39:09,038
Home?

1309
01:39:09,038 --> 01:39:12,722
Not tonight.
I'm going to be somewhat busy.

1310
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:15,992
That's right.

1311
01:39:21,612 --> 01:39:26,504
Mr. Kringle! Mr. Kringle! Mr. Kringle!

1312
01:39:33,357 --> 01:39:35,964
This is going to blow up in my face, isn't it?

1313
01:39:38,763 --> 01:39:41,712
I lost bigger than i ever thought I'd win.

1314
01:39:41,712 --> 01:39:43,144
There was a lot of pressure.

1315
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:45,463
Who knew what the judge was going to do

1316
01:39:45,463 --> 01:39:49,755
when he was faced
With putting Santa in the nut house?

1317
01:39:49,755 --> 01:39:51,691
He isn't Santa Claus.

1318
01:39:51,691 --> 01:39:53,727
What the hell is the matter with everybody?

1319
01:39:53,727 --> 01:39:55,894
There is no Santa Claus!

1320
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:15,704
Is somebody getting married?

1321
01:43:15,704 --> 01:43:17,456
Not that I know of.

1322
01:43:20,717 --> 01:43:23,610
Did you arrange this?

1323
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:27,025
No. You did.

1324
01:43:27,025 --> 01:43:28,597
Oh, i did?

1325
01:43:28,597 --> 01:43:29,463
You didn't?

1326
01:43:29,463 --> 01:43:30,584
I didn't. Did you?

1327
01:43:30,584 --> 01:43:32,876
- I didn't.
- I know you did.

1328
01:43:32,876 --> 01:43:34,224
- Oh, no.
- Yes, you did.

1329
01:43:34,224 --> 01:43:35,728
You did, didn't you?

1330
01:43:35,728 --> 01:43:38,289
I did not.

1331
01:43:38,289 --> 01:43:39,632
Father?

1332
01:43:43,285 --> 01:43:44,768
Are you ready?

1333
01:43:45,913 --> 01:43:47,868
For what?

1334
01:43:47,868 --> 01:43:49,456
To get married.

1335
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:12,988
I have something to tell you.

1336
01:45:16,569 --> 01:45:18,050
What'd you get for christmas?

1337
01:45:53,372 --> 01:45:55,812
Susan, that's not why we're going to the house.

1338
01:45:55,812 --> 01:45:58,256
We're going to the catalog house, right?

1339
01:45:58,256 --> 01:46:00,628
That's the house i told him I wanted.

1340
01:46:00,628 --> 01:46:03,091
I showed him a picture of it.

1341
01:46:03,091 --> 01:46:05,159
He said he would get it for me.

1342
01:46:05,159 --> 01:46:07,352
A house is a big gift.

1343
01:46:07,352 --> 01:46:08,782
That's what Mr. Kringle said.

1344
01:46:08,782 --> 01:46:13,383
We are going to the house
because it's snowing,

1345
01:46:13,383 --> 01:46:14,920
and it's very pretty,

1346
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:17,613
And because Mr. Shellhammer
wants to take photographs

1347
01:46:17,613 --> 01:46:19,753
for next year's Christmas catalog,

1348
01:46:19,753 --> 01:46:24,005
which, I think, is awfully bold of him.
It is a holiday.

1349
01:46:24,005 --> 01:46:26,219
That's just an excuse.

1350
01:46:26,219 --> 01:46:28,092
Mr. Kringle did all this.

1351
01:46:28,092 --> 01:46:32,050
I'm very sorry, mother.
You have it perfectly wrong.

1352
01:47:23,034 --> 01:47:24,997
You got a bonus.

1353
01:47:24,997 --> 01:47:25,929
What do you mean?

1354
01:47:25,929 --> 01:47:27,513
Our name's on the mailbox.

1355
01:47:27,513 --> 01:47:29,989
I got a call last night from Mr. Kringle,

1356
01:47:29,989 --> 01:47:34,382
who said you And your husband
were looking for a house.

1357
01:47:34,382 --> 01:47:36,110
He was quite insistent.

1358
01:47:37,986 --> 01:47:39,539
Did you get married?

1359
01:47:39,539 --> 01:47:41,148
Yeah. Last night.

1360
01:47:41,148 --> 01:47:42,438
I can't believe it.

1361
01:47:42,438 --> 01:47:44,658
Congratulations.

1362
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:45,886
Was this planned?

1363
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:48,522
Uh...no.

1364
01:47:48,522 --> 01:47:50,094
I can't believe it.

1365
01:47:50,094 --> 01:47:55,336
Mr. Kringle wanted to be here, but, uh,
he's overseas.

1366
01:47:57,834 --> 01:47:59,821
Mr. Kringle?

1367
01:47:59,821 --> 01:48:02,985
Oh, the house is for sale,

1368
01:48:02,985 --> 01:48:04,706
but I'm sure you can afford it now.

1369
01:48:04,706 --> 01:48:09,280
We all get our bonuses thanks to you
and, uh, Mr. Kringle.

1370
01:48:15,258 --> 01:48:16,546
Wow.

1371
01:48:29,646 --> 01:48:30,807
I knew it.

1372
01:48:31,497 --> 01:48:33,924
Oh, thank you.

1373
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:38,336
Oh, I don't know what to say,
except merry christmas.

1374
01:48:38,336 --> 01:48:39,216
Merry christmas.

1375
01:48:39,216 --> 01:48:40,669
Oh.

1376
01:48:40,669 --> 01:48:42,238
Chin-chin.

1377
01:48:50,966 --> 01:48:52,947
This is the house I asked Kriss for.

1378
01:48:52,947 --> 01:48:54,707
He got it for me,

1379
01:48:54,707 --> 01:48:57,079
and he got me a dad,

1380
01:48:57,079 --> 01:48:58,509
and the third thing--

1381
01:48:58,509 --> 01:49:02,294
I guess I'll just have to wait for it,

1382
01:49:02,294 --> 01:49:05,197
but he'll get it for me, won't he?

1383
01:49:05,197 --> 01:49:10,067
If Kriss said he'd get you something,
