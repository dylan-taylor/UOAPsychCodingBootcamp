1
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,198
Oh, yeah! Yeah, you want to dance?

2
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,397
You don't mind if I get up in there, do you?

3
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:50,108
- This is kind of sexy.
- Yeah. Love it!

4
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:51,645
You're kind of sexy.

5
00:00:51,713 --> 00:00:54,806
You should take one of these.
Very lightweight on your shoulders, ladies.

6
00:00:54,882 --> 00:00:58,375
Try it out, try it out. There you go.
Feels good, yeah?

7
00:00:58,453 --> 00:00:59,442
Whoo!

8
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:01,387
Whoo!

9
00:01:02,257 --> 00:01:03,588
Here.

10
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:06,718
Follow me, ladies.
Follow me to the cash register.

11
00:01:07,195 --> 00:01:09,129
I see you guys.
You guys look like you smoke weed, right?

12
00:01:09,197 --> 00:01:11,392
Okay, you're gonna smoke a bowl,
you're gonna buy one of these TVs.

13
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:13,457
Philips, all right.
You know, you're kind of high, feels good.

14
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:15,264
Samsung, kind of last year.

15
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:16,964
Magnavox, bam!

16
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:19,563
That's an explosion!
You're stoned, it'll blow your mind!

17
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:21,507
You want to go really small, I got this one.

18
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:24,602
Really small. Look at this flip-phone. Look.

19
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,048
"Hello, Joan. What are you doing?"

20
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:30,016
- "I don't know. What are you doing?"
- "I'm great."

21
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:41,162
- You are so bad.
- Guys? Christy.

22
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:43,024
Hey.

23
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:50,268
Said one, two princes kneel before you

24
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:51,864
That's what I said now

25
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:55,302
Here, take my card. Take my card.

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,505
Take my card. Okay? Take my card.

27
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:06,122
Go, Joan. Go, Joan. Go, Joan. Go, Joan.

28
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,215
In the house. Go, Joan. Go, Joan.

29
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:12,994
Oh. Sorry, Joan.

30
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:20,966
Okay, squeeze the nipple.
Squeeze the nipple. Harder.

31
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:24,531
Okay. Oh, my God!

32
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:27,174
- What are you doing?
- Feel that.

33
00:02:29,713 --> 00:02:32,274
We can't do this. Jerry's right out there.

34
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,339
He can watch.

35
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:36,514
What makes you so damn sexy?

36
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:38,980
Oh, my God.

37
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:44,218
I promise you, man,

38
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:46,923
80 watts is more than
you'll ever need for a living room.

39
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:48,964
Excuse me.

40
00:02:50,902 --> 00:02:54,337
- Hello?
- Oh, Jesus. Harder.

41
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:55,730
Oh!

42
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:58,070
- Okay. Oh!
- What the...

43
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:00,235
You fucking piece of shit!

44
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:01,711
You fucked up son of a bitch!

45
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,940
Christy! What the hell is wrong with you?

46
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:06,314
- How can I ever trust you again?
- I don't know. I'm so sorry.

47
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:07,682
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- No, I...

48
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:10,347
You know, Fujitsu makes the same unit
for 40 bucks less.

49
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:12,515
- Really?
- Yeah, but they don't sell it here.

50
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:13,922
Oh...

51
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:16,893
But I could get it for you, if you want.

52
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:18,122
Oh! Are you, like, okay?

53
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:20,956
Oh.

54
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,466
- Yeah.
- Okay.

55
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:24,024
Give me your number.
I'll let you know when I have it.

56
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:25,159
Um...

57
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,999
- What's your name?
- Amber.

58
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:28,835
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Shut the fuck up, Christy!

59
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:30,533
You.

60
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,301
Don't you ever fucking come in here again!

61
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:36,371
You know what? You owe me commission
on $54,000 worth of second-rate,

62
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,215
knock-off, gray-market, off-brand,
overpriced equipment, you son of a bitch.

63
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,277
I'll fucking kill you, you piece of shit!

64
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,549
You know what?
Why don't you just send it to me?

65
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,647
Christy knows the address.

66
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,092
Amber! 434-6603!

67
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,592
Why don't you tell Daddy

68
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,862
what a downtown Chicago hospital
is really like?

69
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:59,736
Patient brought in with chills,
nausea, ischemia, clearly in shock.

70
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,069
Did you do a CBC?

71
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:04,234
Excuse me, our protocols didn't
exist when you went to medical school.

72
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,644
Oh! Yes, I've been under a rock
these past 30 years.

73
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,582
How many transdermal intubations
have you personally done?

74
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:14,781
My dear, I teach medicine. I no longer
sully my hands touching actual patients.

75
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,446
- Ha!
- Touch patients?

76
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,115
Why would anybody want to do that?

77
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,183
You are not allowed in this conversation.

78
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,455
Excuse me. I've helped more patients
than you ever will.

79
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,860
Can I pour this drink on your head?

80
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,729
What is wrong with getting rich?

81
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,767
God only knows you can't do that
in medicine anymore.

82
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,703
- He's right about that!
- Don't help him justify his laziness.

83
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:32,932
I already justified my laziness.

84
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,306
It's called $35 million on my first IPO.

85
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:37,866
Jamie, help me.

86
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,382
- He's a geek who got lucky.
- And he'll always be a geek.

87
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,383
Yeah? Well, this geek
is taking back your shares.

88
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,509
I don't blame you.

89
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:46,611
The profession was ruined
when they let women in.

90
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:47,712
I'm killing both of you.

91
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:51,225
I'm killing all of you
if you don't get in there and sit down.

92
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,852
And we get to keep all the shares.

93
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:55,291
- Ugh!
- All right.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,798
Jamie!

95
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,495
Of course, it really happened.

96
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,539
Who wants to see
a movie about protesting?

97
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:06,234
Whatever.

98
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:08,832
To the sale of Josh's company!

99
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,879
- Whatever the hell it does.
- Yes!

100
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:13,772
Long live medical software.

101
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:16,112
And med school dropouts everywhere.

102
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,447
You'd better give
some of this money away,

103
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,954
- that's all I have to say.
- Not gonna happen.

104
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:20,545
Jamie, what are you up to these days?

105
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:24,583
- Jamie's selling high-end stereo equipment.
- Ha!

106
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:26,620
Not anymore.

107
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,491
What do you mean?

108
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,900
Well, let's just say Jamie had
a falling out with management.

109
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,536
I thought you were in real estate.

110
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:42,635
I am looking for other opportunities.

111
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:46,512
We're living through the greatest creation
of wealth in modern history,

112
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,845
and my brother decides to quit.

113
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,223
Josh has been talking to me
about pharmaceutical sales.

114
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,588
Pharmaceutical sales?

115
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,648
Pharmaceutical sales.

116
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:59,491
You know, medicine that's
supposed to help people get better.

117
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:02,054
Remember Timmy,
my roommate from Brown?

118
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:04,192
He's a VP at Pfizer. So I said to Jamie,

119
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:07,065
"Jamie, if you suck on my cock,
I'll get you an interview."

120
00:06:07,204 --> 00:06:09,332
- Oh, Josh, watch your mouth!
- Watch your mouth!

121
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,806
I said no, Mom. I said no.

122
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:15,136
Why would you wanna be
a pharmaceutical rep?

123
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:16,942
"Why would you wanna be
a pharmaceutical rep?"

124
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:20,575
Because it's the only entry-level job in
America that pays over 100 grand a year.

125
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:21,675
- That's why.
- No.

126
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:24,516
Those people come into our office
with their roller bags and samples,

127
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:25,783
like door-to-door-salesmen.

128
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:27,256
They are door-to-door-salesmen,

129
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:29,760
only what they're selling
grosses $87 billion a year!

130
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:31,658
Yeah, and they're turning
complex medical decisions

131
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:32,991
- into Madison Avenue impulse buying.
- Oh, my God.

132
00:06:33,064 --> 00:06:34,430
Look, I'm not selling to the patients, okay?

133
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,989
No. No, the patients just see
the commercials on TV...

134
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,227
I'm not even doing the job yet!

135
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:38,929
...and demand their name-brand drugs
from the doctors...

136
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:41,529
Calm down, you're freaking out.
- ... and there you are to supply them.

137
00:06:41,607 --> 00:06:42,595
This is so crazy

138
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:44,232
that you're yelling at me for nothing!
I'm not doing it!

139
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:49,679
If you barbarians won't be still
and finish this lamb,

140
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:53,383
none of you will get the chocolate cake.

141
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:55,749
Yes, Mom!

142
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:06,162
Oh, Jamie,
if you could make money fucking,

143
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:08,359
you'd be even richer than me.

144
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:14,997
I'll call the Pfizer guy in the morning.

145
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:20,372
Let's welcome the class of 1997 trainees!

146
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:31,991
This is not a pill. This is tens
of millions of dollars in research.

147
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:35,726
This is thousands of hours of hard labor.

148
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:38,788
This, ladies and gentlemen, is software.

149
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,789
Your training will last six weeks.

150
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:44,770
Each of you will leave here
a fully qualified health care professional.

151
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:47,101
That's 33% fewer phone calls
for you at 4:00 a. m.

152
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,574
That's 33% less angry... Shit!

153
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:52,845
Your job will be to go fight illness.

154
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:01,884
Hello... Fuck!

155
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:03,618
Shit!

156
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:08,089
Ah! Fuck! Ah! Shit! Ow!

157
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,662
Off-label uses are benefits
not yet recognized by the FDA.

158
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:17,164
But you can boost sales
by hinting at what these uses are.

159
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:18,796
Hello, Doctor.
Do you know that prescribing Zithromax...

160
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,465
Prescribing Zithromax...

161
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,141
Bonjour, Doctor!

162
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,304
Prescribing Zithromax... Zithromax.

163
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,472
Ah!

164
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:30,481
Zoloft, a drug approved solely
for the treatment of depression.

165
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:34,545
Off-label uses: alcoholism, bulimia, PMS,

166
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:36,750
smoking, social anxiety.

167
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:38,453
Is there a question?

168
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:45,130
Zoloft has been associated
with suicidal ideation in teenagers.

169
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:46,224
Unproven.

170
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:47,496
Proven. Unreported.

171
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:51,803
Your job will be to
go share this technology.

172
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:56,338
Your job will be to go save lives.

173
00:08:57,014 --> 00:09:00,073
The health care industry today
is worth $2 trillion a year.

174
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:02,909
The top 10 pharma companies
make more money

175
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:07,946
than all 490 of the other
Fortune 500 companies combined.

176
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:11,460
- What family is Feldene a part of?
- Non-steroidal...

177
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:14,429
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory.
An NSAID.

178
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:20,833
A better world, that's why we're here.

179
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:22,371
Lipitor in Palm Beach!

180
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,373
Xanax, New England!

181
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:29,135
What about you, Jamie-bamie?

182
00:09:29,212 --> 00:09:32,239
Zoloft and Zithromax
in the Ohio River Valley.

183
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:34,545
Welcome to Pfizer!

184
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:48,830
What are you thinking about?

185
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,162
Money.

186
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:54,795
Pay attention.

187
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:58,638
We are not going door-to-door selling
oatmeal cookies for the Girl Scouts here.

188
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,578
You are not the goddamn Avon lady.
You understand what I'm saying?

189
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:05,644
This is hardcore sales,
and you have a quota.

190
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:08,243
And people at the home office
keeping track of that quota.

191
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:10,753
And your cold calls, and your mileage,
and your receipts.

192
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:12,450
How often you goddamn masturbate.

193
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:13,923
What is the quota for masturbation?

194
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:17,857
You can masturbate
as much as you like, smartass,

195
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,295
as long as you make a lot of money.

196
00:10:19,364 --> 00:10:20,523
Okay.

197
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,163
Voila!
Okay, now, remember.

198
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:25,135
Hospitals have a no-reps policy.

199
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:28,765
Doesn't mean we can't give the docs
a nice, dry walk from their cars.

200
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:30,839
All right?

201
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:32,368
There he is. All right.

202
00:10:32,444 --> 00:10:33,502
No time like the present.

203
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:34,876
- Get your head in the game.
- All right.

204
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:36,540
- Remember, Pfizer makes his life better.
- Okay.

205
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:38,480
Pfizer makes his patients happier,

206
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,017
- so he makes more money.
- Okay.

207
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:42,281
- Wait, the pens, the pens!
- Oh, the pens!

208
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:43,344
Always lead with a pen.

209
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,884
Gifts establish reciprocity!

210
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:49,083
Doctor!

211
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,729
Hey, Doctor, Jamie Randall. Pfizer.
How are you doing?

212
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:53,595
- No, thank you.
- Look... It's wet out here.

213
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,327
I don't want you compromising
your immune system.

214
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:56,527
Let's talk about Zithromax for a second.

215
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:58,036
Which part of "No, thank you"
do you not understand?

216
00:10:58,104 --> 00:10:59,230
- You wanna take a pen?
- No, thank you.

217
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:00,499
Okay.

218
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:06,003
That's 33% fewer phone calls for you
at 4:00 a. m.

219
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,069
Please stop, okay?

220
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:08,580
That's why I wanna talk to you
about Zithromax, okay?

221
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:10,707
We are throwing antibiotics at people
the minute they sneeze,

222
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:11,809
and it doesn't work on viruses anyway.

223
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:13,080
- What's your name?
- Goldstein.

224
00:11:13,154 --> 00:11:15,212
Right. Dr. Goldstein,
okay, what we're doing...

225
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:18,456
No, what you're doing is creating
classes of drug-resistant superbugs.

226
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:20,015
And that might be good for business,

227
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:22,528
because you will develop
stronger antibiotics

228
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:24,291
and ruin people's
immune systems altogether.

229
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:25,992
- No... You...
- Thank you.

230
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:41,146
Models. Beauty queens.

231
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:44,315
Equestrian princesses. Shit.

232
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:47,613
You know what I heard?
They're even starting to hire strippers.

233
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,118
I heard that.

234
00:11:54,396 --> 00:11:55,522
Hey, Lisa!

235
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,433
- Her name's not Lisa.
- I know. I know.

236
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:03,494
But if every time I say, "Hey, Lisa,"

237
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:05,768
then eventually she'll come up to me
and she'll be like, you know,

238
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:10,438
"My name's not Lisa, it's Jennifer,"
or whatever, and I'll do a big apology

239
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:14,812
and I'll say, "I thought you were the Lisa
who was mad at me for not calling."

240
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:17,409
And from then on, Jennifer,
or whatever her name is,

241
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,785
will think that I dated a girl
who looked just like her, who I rejected.

242
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:23,087
She'll develop this unconscious need
to win my approval,

243
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,389
and from then on, it's cake.

244
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:28,794
Damn!

245
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:33,628
Accepted etiquette is one rep at a time.
Screw etiquette.

246
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:37,230
Competing reps are not your friends.
Okay, Knight.

247
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:38,830
- Where you going?
- Oh. Sorry.

248
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:40,672
Knight is a doc you gotta close.

249
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:42,074
Leads the largest group in the city.

250
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:45,137
Lots of fucked-up college students
on Prozac who should be on Zoloft.

251
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:46,443
You always bring donuts?

252
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,278
Pharma sales is a lot like dating.

253
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,253
They want you to take them to dinner
and pretend to expect nothing in return.

254
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:53,618
- And no one ever got laid by going Dutch.
- Exactly.

255
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:57,952
Gail, good morning!
How are you this fine day?

256
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:07,761
Sick people touch those.

257
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,536
When I order a second test,
it's for a reason, God damn it.

258
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:14,005
Unbelievable!

259
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:16,740
That's him. Another time.

260
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:23,080
If they don't take us in five minutes,
we leave. Only losers wait.

261
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:24,347
There he is.

262
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:25,787
Hey there, beautiful. How you doing?

263
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:28,254
Get over here, Trey.

264
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:31,294
Two tickets to La Bohème on the 19th.

265
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:34,354
I hate you. Can't you go with me
instead of my husband?

266
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:38,994
Trey Hannigan. Lilly's Prozac rep,
top 10 nationally. The Devil.

267
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,061
He's on the phone with Watson.
You can go on back.

268
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,573
He's the reason
we never make our quota on Zoloft.

269
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:48,875
- Is he going in?
- What a dick!

270
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:52,678
If we can show 5% gains monthly,
we're going to the promised land.

271
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:55,146
The promised land?

272
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,687
Chicago.

273
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:58,847
Civilization. Culture.

274
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:01,825
And not incidentally, my wife and kids.

275
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:04,021
Only the great and near-great get Chicago,

276
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:06,792
but I got a hunch
that you and your swinging dick

277
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:08,526
might be my ticket to the big leagues.

278
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:20,871
Good morning.

279
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,540
Doctor only sees new reps
who bring a lunch.

280
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:25,243
Here's a list of available dates.

281
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:27,149
- The first one is in five weeks.
- Great.

282
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,179
Here's a list of approved foods,
no sushi, no salads.

283
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:32,451
No salads.

284
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:34,652
Leave your samples with me.

285
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,157
- Hi.
- Five weeks.

286
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:38,957
You're going to like me.

287
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,024
I beg your pardon?

288
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:43,729
Sooner or later, everybody does.
You wanna know why?

289
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:47,205
'Cause I'll do whatever it takes
to make that happen. I'm very trainable.

290
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:50,004
- What's your name?
- Gail. Five weeks.

291
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:51,476
Oh, Gail, that's not fair.

292
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:52,841
I'm laying myself bare here.

293
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:56,849
I'm revealing my true vulnerability.
And now you're stonewalling me.

294
00:14:57,684 --> 00:14:58,673
Is that fair?

295
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,488
- That's not fair.
- You stay out of this.

296
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:04,149
Look at you angels of mercy! How do
the docs get any work done around here?

297
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:05,556
Fine. What do you want?

298
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,086
I just want you to let me leave my samples
where he'll see them.

299
00:15:09,164 --> 00:15:11,427
'Cause otherwise, you're gonna
throw them away after I leave.

300
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:20,038
Gail. No sushi, no salads.

301
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:34,646
Who let you back here?

302
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,018
Oh! Dr. Knight! Do you know that
prescribing Zithromax for ear infections,

303
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:40,152
- diarrhea and...
- Cindy! Can you deal with this, please?

304
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:42,628
How about a pen?
Do you want a pen?

305
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,073
- Okay, Prince Charming, time's up.
- Oh! Okay.

306
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:04,614
Wow! That is a long handle!

307
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:06,279
- Would you like a pen?
- Thanks.

308
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:07,379
Purple.

309
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:08,822
- Bye.
- Bye.

310
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:32,039
Uh,

311
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:34,641
I got something for you today.

312
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:38,381
Wait, I think... Yup.
There's another one for you, too!

313
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:45,324
The thing about these pens is that
they have tiny little point tips on them,

314
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,796
and then I end up pressing too hard, and...

315
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:49,527
Hello, gorgeous.

316
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,632
Jamie! Jamie, they're beautiful!

317
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,145
Hey, Lisa!

318
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:15,688
Okay, this may have worked for you
in the past, but let me lay it out.

319
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:19,627
I became a rep for one reason, doctors.

320
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:24,532
To meet doctors, fraternize with doctors,
breed with doctors.

321
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:29,107
So next time you see me in the field,
don't ask for a handout.

322
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:31,005
It's just awkward.

323
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,941
I want Chicago, Randall. And right now,
you're not making it happen!

324
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:42,283
You're 20% below your quota for Z,
you're 45% below your quota for Zoloft!

325
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:44,455
You want me off your ass, you punk?

326
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,388
There's your answer.

327
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:51,061
He's got toddlers taking Prozac.
He's got dogs taking Prozac.

328
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,032
He'd have rocks taking Prozac
if they paid cash.

329
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,693
And by the way, you want
one doctor to start writing Zoloft?

330
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:57,828
It's the guy standing next to him.

331
00:17:58,205 --> 00:17:59,672
- Knight?
- Knight.

332
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:01,467
Hannigan's butt buddy.

333
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,738
But I swear, he starts writing it,
the rest of the docs will follow.

334
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:06,334
And Windy City, here we come.

335
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:12,681
- Dr. Knight.
- Hey, I'm very late.

336
00:18:12,752 --> 00:18:14,913
- One thousand dollars.
- Excuse me?

337
00:18:14,988 --> 00:18:17,822
- It's a check for $1,000.
- For what?

338
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:19,414
For a special Pfizer preceptorship.

339
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:22,519
For me to shadow you, learn your practice,
and better serve the needs of doctors.

340
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:24,789
Are you bribing me?

341
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:27,060
No, Doctor, no.

342
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:31,035
It's a special Pfizer preceptorship
for me to shadow you.

343
00:18:32,673 --> 00:18:33,697
Is this a joke?

344
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:36,606
If you think $1,000 is a joke.

345
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,678
That's 33% fewer phone calls at 4:00 a. m...

346
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:44,273
I'd write a lot more of your scrip
if I were a regularly paid consultant.

347
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:46,252
Well, you know,
we can talk to them about that.

348
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,379
They spend $5 billion a year
on marketing, right?

349
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:51,719
Instead of flying me to Cancún
and making me sit through

350
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:54,590
some bullshit, nonsense,
peer-to-peer conference,

351
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,391
just give me half that money in cash.

352
00:18:56,464 --> 00:18:57,557
- Yeah, but Cancún...
- Dr. Knight,

353
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:58,725
- Mrs. Putney's on the phone. Excuse me.
- Sorry.

354
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,233
Her daughter has to sing on Friday.
They're doing Bye Bye Birdie,

355
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:04,602
and she's playing Kim, and she wondered
if you could call in an antibiotic?

356
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:06,800
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay, thanks.

357
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:07,933
Hey.

358
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,205
This can't be right. Janice? Janice?

359
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,577
A 26-year-old needs
Parkinson's medication?

360
00:19:12,648 --> 00:19:15,014
- Beth wrote that one up.
- Hi.

361
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:19,385
All right, look, if a patient asks,
you're an intern, okay?

362
00:19:19,454 --> 00:19:21,616
Yeah. Can I take notes?

363
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:23,351
- Sure. Why not?
- All right.

364
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:26,389
Hey. I'm Dr. Knight.

365
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:28,293
- Maggie Murdock.
- Hi.

366
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,132
- So your file says, "Kind of an emergency."
- Yeah.

367
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,671
My apartment was burgled yesterday,
and they took my Parkinson's meds.

368
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:41,303
But my symptoms are pretty good today,
so it's "kind of an emergency."

369
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:45,345
I know your Lilly rep, Trey Hannigan?
He asked Cindy to squeeze me in, so...

370
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:46,780
Yeah, Trey's a great guy.

371
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:48,908
Oh. Well, I wouldn't say that.

372
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:53,647
So, monotherapy?

373
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:56,625
Yep. Sinemet CR, 50 milligrams,
two times a day,

374
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:59,924
plus Domperidone to cut the nausea,
10 milligrams, three times a day.

375
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:03,763
Artane for the tremor, two milligrams,
a whole tablet, three times a day.

376
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:05,460
And Prozac, so that I'm not too bummed

377
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:08,300
about having
a major degenerative disorder at 26.

378
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:10,271
Forty milligrams, once, in the morning.

379
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,173
Zoloft has fewer side effects.

380
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:14,971
I'm sorry, who are you?

381
00:20:15,612 --> 00:20:16,772
Jamie Randall.

382
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:18,406
Oh.

383
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:19,604
Hi.

384
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:21,008
Intern.

385
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:27,547
So, early-onset Parkinson's.
That's pretty rare.

386
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:31,493
Yeah, yeah, yeah. First they thought it was
essential tremor, then Wilson's disease,

387
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:36,830
then Huntington's.
Then, they tested for MAS, PSP, syphilis.

388
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,136
I was very glad for a negative on that one.

389
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:43,038
I didn't really relish the thought
of feeling like a 19th century slut.

390
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:47,935
Let's see. Then, there was
brain tumor week, which was very scary.

391
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:50,914
And then six months
chasing obscure dystonias,

392
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,576
but, no, it just turned out to be
good, old-fashioned Parkinson's.

393
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:56,450
Right. And... Don't you have a neurologist?

394
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,087
We broke up.

395
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,587
And do you have insurance?

396
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:05,755
Do I have insurance.

397
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,357
Okay.

398
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,498
Well, sure. Why not?

399
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,300
- Great.
- Is there anything else I can do for you?

400
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,361
Nope. Oh!

401
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,497
Um...

402
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,039
Actually, yeah.

403
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,138
I have a weird blotch on my breast.

404
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,446
I don't know,
I'm trying not to freak out about it.

405
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,043
- Well, let's have a look.
- Great.

406
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,150
Here you go. Do you see that?

407
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:38,123
- That's a spider bite.
- Is it?

408
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:39,824
Yeah, that's a spider bite.

409
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,128
Great!

410
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:42,459
All right.

411
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:44,461
- There you are.
- Thank you, Dr. Knight.

412
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:45,562
Sure.

413
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,034
You're welcome.

414
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,709
- You're a drug rep?
- Wait...

415
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:59,718
You let me take my shirt off,
you fucking creep!

416
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:01,816
Wait, wait, wait. I'm hurt.

417
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,913
- Your buckle just hit my eye.
- No, it didn't.

418
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,583
- I'm hurt. I'm hurt.
- Oh, my God.

419
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,150
Who said I was a drug rep?

420
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:08,819
Excuse me, look at your bag!

421
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,764
I don't think
you're going to the fucking airport.

422
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,892
Okay, look, just apologize, okay?
Just apologize.

423
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:14,992
Would you do that just once?

424
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:18,129
I would actually like to hear someone from
the medical community actually apologize!

425
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:20,606
Okay. Okay, I apologize.

426
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:26,614
I apologize on behalf of all the arrogant,
faceless, cut-off, asshole doctors out there

427
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:30,812
who've treated you like a non-person
while peeking at your breasts.

428
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:34,446
So what's your name?

429
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:36,948
You're good.

430
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,858
Strong eye contact. Implied intimacy.
You'll make your quotas.

431
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:43,260
Let me take you out
for a cup of coffee then.

432
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:45,928
Whoa! What was that for?

433
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:48,132
Eat shit and die, that's what that was.

434
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:50,899
No, wait, wait! Hold on one second!
I can do a better apology!

435
00:22:56,845 --> 00:22:58,244
'Cause I want to know.

436
00:23:00,783 --> 00:23:03,910
The same white tights
I wear every single day.

437
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:06,182
You are out of your mind.

438
00:23:06,256 --> 00:23:08,052
All right, nothing underneath?

439
00:23:10,393 --> 00:23:12,486
- You're bad!
- So,

440
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:16,892
I need the number of
a patient he saw yesterday.

441
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:19,696
A Murdock, or something like that.

442
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,259
You want Maggie Murdock's number?

443
00:23:21,337 --> 00:23:25,000
Yes. Because she mentioned,
like, six neurologists,

444
00:23:25,074 --> 00:23:28,134
and Pfizer's coming out
with a new Parkinson's med,

445
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:31,476
and I wanna contact them all,
and I wanna make a lot of money,

446
00:23:31,548 --> 00:23:32,742
Miss None Of Your Business.

447
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:36,418
- We're not supposed to give out numbers.
- What?

448
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:38,386
You gave me your number, you bad girl.

449
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,616
Do your friends know
how bad you really are?

450
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:42,858
Jamie!

451
00:23:42,926 --> 00:23:44,394
Because if they knew
how bad you really are...

452
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:51,127
Listen, I promise I'll wear the stethoscope
next time we play naughty nurse.

453
00:23:56,106 --> 00:23:57,971
546-2312.

454
00:23:58,042 --> 00:24:00,375
Okay, I got to go. Thanks, bye.

455
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:07,040
What are you doing here?

456
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:10,952
I'm all fucked up!

457
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,184
- Farrah kicked me out.
- No way.

458
00:24:14,593 --> 00:24:19,053
Can you believe that? I think she's fucking
somebody already, I swear to God!

459
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,064
- Why did she kick you out?
- I don't know, Jamie!

460
00:24:21,132 --> 00:24:23,760
- Jesus!
- She said I was addicted to Internet porn.

461
00:24:23,836 --> 00:24:25,598
- Are you?
- Of course I am!

462
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,297
Fuck! Isn't everybody?

463
00:24:27,372 --> 00:24:29,341
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God.

464
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:31,542
I can't breathe.

465
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:34,739
I'm having a panic attack.

466
00:24:35,314 --> 00:24:37,907
- Do you have any Ativan?
- We're Xanax.

467
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:40,544
Fine, Xanax!
You have any samples of Xanax?

468
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,454
Jamie, I'm in a really vulnerable place
right now.

469
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:50,118
Okay. Okay.

470
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:51,961
Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

471
00:24:52,031 --> 00:24:53,828
Come here, come here, come here.
It's okay.

472
00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:55,730
Dude! Dude!

473
00:24:57,303 --> 00:24:59,295
We're not huggers.

474
00:25:02,408 --> 00:25:04,969
Faster. Come on! We got this!

475
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,070
- Josh, will you turn that down?
- Oh. No.

476
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:09,746
Josh!

477
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,549
- Hello?
- Why did you take that picture?

478
00:25:18,925 --> 00:25:21,291
Is that the girl with the tits?

479
00:25:22,996 --> 00:25:24,327
How'd you get my number?

480
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:27,399
What, you called Knight's office?

481
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,197
- How'd you get my number?
- From the receptionist.

482
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:33,832
Who you're fucking.

483
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:35,201
What'd she say?

484
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:36,803
Have coffee with me.

485
00:25:38,146 --> 00:25:40,909
- Why?
- Because I'm a drug rep.

486
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:42,175
I'm not a creep.

487
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:45,942
Same thing.

488
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:50,252
Look, I'm sorry that I stared at your tits,
but they're really nice.

489
00:25:54,062 --> 00:25:55,086
Hello?

490
00:25:56,364 --> 00:25:57,524
Yes. Yes.

491
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:00,066
Oh, I thought you hung up for a second.

492
00:26:00,635 --> 00:26:01,727
Should I have?

493
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,404
What, and miss the opportunity
of insulting me?

494
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:07,005
Oh, you like being insulted?

495
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:10,668
Hold on a second.

496
00:26:12,647 --> 00:26:13,637
Ow!

497
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,342
By the right person.

498
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:21,185
Oh, my God. This is a sales call, isn't it?

499
00:26:21,256 --> 00:26:24,783
You're gonna stay on the phone with me
until I say yes, aren't you?

500
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,725
Well, I take my work very seriously.

501
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:31,665
5:00, Lulu's on Clark.

502
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:33,735
All right. Bye.

503
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:41,442
Why is your answer
to everything violence?

504
00:26:45,014 --> 00:26:46,742
I said 5:00.

505
00:26:50,186 --> 00:26:52,780
- Very cute.
- Oh! Please, you can have him.

506
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:55,188
Khaki pants? No, thanks.

507
00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:01,726
So... What's your name?

508
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,723
Jamie Randall.

509
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,633
Jamie, right. Okay, sorry.
What's your game?

510
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:08,529
My game?

511
00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:10,470
I'm sorry, right, this is
the part where we talk about

512
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,975
where we come from
and what we majored in, in college.

513
00:27:13,043 --> 00:27:14,476
You have beautiful eyes.

514
00:27:15,645 --> 00:27:17,580
That's it? That's the best you got?

515
00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:18,945
I'm serious. They're beautiful.

516
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:23,919
Well, thank you. Let's see, what else?
My childhood? When did I get sick?

517
00:27:23,988 --> 00:27:25,148
So, are you always this mean?

518
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:27,086
Actually, this is me being nice.

519
00:27:32,062 --> 00:27:33,256
So, how's your quota this month?

520
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,854
Have you had
your first performance review?

521
00:27:34,932 --> 00:27:36,263
Is that a resting tremor?

522
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:38,194
Comes and goes?

523
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:40,897
It's none of your business.

524
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,171
Happens when you're nervous.

525
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:45,773
Mr. Expert, why would I be nervous?

526
00:27:45,843 --> 00:27:47,778
- 'Cause you're interested.
- And that would make me nervous?

527
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:51,076
Yeah, your mind's telling you one thing,
your body's telling you something else.

528
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:58,483
Let's go.

529
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:01,249
Excuse me?

530
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:03,590
You wanna close, right?
You wanna get laid?

531
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:04,856
Now?

532
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,827
Mmm. Oh, right, right, right. I'm supposed
to act like I don't know if it's right,

533
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:15,862
so then you tell me that there is no right
or wrong, there's just the moment.

534
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:21,376
And then I tell you that I can't,
while actually signaling to you that I can,

535
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:23,506
which you don't need,
because you're not really listening,

536
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:27,178
because this isn't about connection
for you, this isn't even about sex for you.

537
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:31,246
This is about finding an hour or two
of relief from the pain of being you.

538
00:28:31,324 --> 00:28:32,757
And that's fine with me, see,

539
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:35,988
because all I want is the exact same thing.

540
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:47,567
Does that mean I don't have to leave a tip?

541
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:18,703
And now you're thinking,
"Will I stay five minutes or ten?"

542
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:21,241
And, "Where did I throw my pager?"

543
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,269
I'm not thinking that. It's under the table.

544
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:31,514
You're probably thinking,
"What's this guy's name again?"

545
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:34,782
Bye, Johnny.

546
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,921
I think it's time for you to go.

547
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:45,488
Whoa, whoa, I don't need to go.

548
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:48,035
Well, I need you to go.

549
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:50,635
Oh, okay.

550
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,904
It was nice meeting you.

551
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:03,345
It was nice meeting you, too.
Maybe we'll...

552
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:08,479
We'll see each other around.
I'll just leave the key there.

553
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:10,889
Thanks.

554
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:05,310
What?

555
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:08,412
Wait! Wait.

556
00:31:12,857 --> 00:31:14,722
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

557
00:31:15,092 --> 00:31:16,492
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

558
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:18,528
I know it's so late.

559
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:20,153
Oh, my God!

560
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:21,790
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

561
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:22,959
Oh, my God!

562
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,536
I didn't see anything! My glasses are off!

563
00:31:25,604 --> 00:31:26,696
Josh, turn around!

564
00:31:31,076 --> 00:31:34,068
Hi. Josh. Pleasure to meet you.

565
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:41,083
I can recite
the six causes of pernicious anemia

566
00:31:41,153 --> 00:31:44,145
and the four stages of terminal cirrhosis.

567
00:31:44,222 --> 00:31:49,057
And by fourth grade, I knew what
a distended ileum felt like on palpation.

568
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:52,595
So why did you bail on med school?

569
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:54,194
I didn't bail. I just
couldn't finish college.

570
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:55,725
I couldn't sit through a class.

571
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:57,800
Oh. Ritalin at 10.

572
00:31:58,603 --> 00:31:59,798
Eight.

573
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:01,904
Show-off.

574
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:05,440
But you were really smart?

575
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:08,947
Yeah. The prodigal son, with ADD.

576
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:11,181
You want to know the truth?

577
00:32:11,617 --> 00:32:12,606
Hmm?

578
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,684
I just couldn't give my father
the satisfaction.

579
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,587
Does this generally work for you?

580
00:32:23,629 --> 00:32:24,858
What?

581
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:31,369
This. The whole misunderstood-by-Dad-
I'm-a-vulnerable-guy thing.

582
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:34,541
Usually. Yeah.

583
00:32:36,376 --> 00:32:38,367
Well, it's pretty good.

584
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:40,610
Thanks.

585
00:32:40,681 --> 00:32:44,448
But somewhere along the line,
say, sixth grade,

586
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,784
a girl smiled at you,
or a bunch of girls smiled at you,

587
00:32:49,691 --> 00:32:53,148
and, ta-da,
Jamie's good at something after all.

588
00:32:54,329 --> 00:32:56,820
Actually, it was the fifth grade.

589
00:32:58,365 --> 00:33:00,857
Why don't you have a boyfriend?

590
00:33:03,403 --> 00:33:04,632
I'm going.

591
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:08,532
- Why?
- See...

592
00:33:11,312 --> 00:33:14,942
The thing is, I really like having sex,

593
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:18,281
and I actually really like
having sex with you,

594
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:22,754
so let's just keep it simple.

595
00:33:22,824 --> 00:33:23,882
I can do that.

596
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,191
Yeah, you do seem like a shithead,

597
00:33:26,262 --> 00:33:28,627
so it should be all right.

598
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:33,361
There's just alarms going off in my head

599
00:33:33,434 --> 00:33:36,666
that you're not entirely what you seem.

600
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:40,402
Oh, no, no. I'm a shithead, believe me.

601
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:45,608
Good.

602
00:33:46,382 --> 00:33:51,012
Because if you turn out
not to be a shithead, that would be bad.

603
00:33:55,225 --> 00:33:58,421
I'm a shithead, believe me.
Through and through.

604
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:20,705
Hey!

605
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:24,081
Hey, man. How are you?

606
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:28,387
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

607
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:32,455
Damaged cells are releasing
arachidonic acid.

608
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:34,593
Your body's converting it to prostaglandin,

609
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:37,225
which is triggering a fiesta
of enzymes necessary for pain.

610
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,200
Do you wanna throw up?
It's not gonna help.

611
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:43,033
It's gonna take about a minute
for the acid to dissipate

612
00:34:43,107 --> 00:34:44,768
and your natural morphine to kick in.

613
00:34:45,776 --> 00:34:47,767
- You know why I hit you?
- No! No!

614
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:51,910
Prozac has helped millions of people
overcome intractable mood disorders,

615
00:34:52,283 --> 00:34:53,808
making miserable lives livable.

616
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:56,482
It's even helped me
with some of my own anger issues.

617
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:59,748
So when someone fucks with my Prozac,
it upsets me.

618
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:01,483
You know what people say about me?

619
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,895
You're in the top ten nationally?

620
00:35:04,963 --> 00:35:05,952
Why do you suppose that is?

621
00:35:06,798 --> 00:35:08,128
Fuck you!

622
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:10,026
Why do you suppose that is?

623
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,297
Because I'm ex-Marine,

624
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:14,202
and I'll destroy anyone
who gets in my way.

625
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:15,262
Right.

626
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:16,896
Shit.

627
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:20,900
Ow!

628
00:35:21,713 --> 00:35:22,702
Fuck.

629
00:35:23,149 --> 00:35:25,480
I'd ice that as soon as you can.

630
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:28,782
If it hurts in a few days, get an X-ray.

631
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:33,717
And stay away from Maggie.

632
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:39,829
Excuse me.

633
00:35:43,436 --> 00:35:44,767
Are those more samples?

634
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:48,331
Yeah. Help yourself.

635
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:51,169
Thanks.

636
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:53,736
I got a job interview today.

637
00:35:54,014 --> 00:35:56,846
Oh, that's great. That's great.

638
00:36:00,354 --> 00:36:01,411
That's great.

639
00:36:04,258 --> 00:36:05,919
Hello, ladies!

640
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:10,090
No samples today.

641
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:12,595
What do you mean?
I got great stuff for you!

642
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,927
No samples today, thank you.

643
00:36:15,836 --> 00:36:16,825
She's just a friend.

644
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:18,337
No samples today. Sorry.

645
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,771
Okay. What's going on?

646
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:24,403
Trey got to you, didn't he?
What'd he give you?

647
00:36:24,678 --> 00:36:26,873
No samples today, thank you. Hawaii.

648
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,708
Hawaii?

649
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:33,914
No samples today. Doctor's convention.
Sand and surf in Honolulu.

650
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,950
Wow. Okay.

651
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,920
Okay.

652
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:48,024
I got to get out of here.

653
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:50,294
You're not going to go see her, are you?

654
00:36:50,972 --> 00:36:52,132
No.

655
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:11,818
Maggie!

656
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:14,051
Hi.

657
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,761
Hey, what's that?

658
00:37:15,998 --> 00:37:17,158
Food.

659
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,658
- For?
- Eating.

660
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:22,228
They're my noodles!

661
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:23,635
You already
have a face full of noodles!

662
00:37:23,706 --> 00:37:24,695
Jesus!

663
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:27,670
My God, you are so selfish.
You're just like my mother.

664
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,808
Did you sleep with your mother?

665
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:32,879
- What?
- You know what?

666
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,843
She's cute, she's available, you'd love her.

667
00:37:36,085 --> 00:37:38,554
The only thing is, she happens to
take up all the oxygen in the room

668
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:40,089
and hog all the closet space,
but other than that,

669
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,282
you two are perfect for each other.

670
00:37:41,357 --> 00:37:43,918
Is she hotter than you?
I bet she's hotter than you.

671
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:45,693
She doesn't have a disease, either.

672
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,687
Does that work for you generally?

673
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:49,527
- What?
- Self-pity.

674
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,925
You are a shithead.

675
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:03,707
What?

676
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:05,712
Nothing.

677
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:12,219
This is nice.

678
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,558
Okay, I think it's time to
take off your clothes and jump me.

679
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,157
Wait. Am I not allowed to say that?

680
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,962
I don't know.

681
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:30,565
First you bring food,
and then you wanna spend the night,

682
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,666
and then you bring a change of clothes,

683
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:34,506
and then you bring a razor and,
oh, my God, it's a relationship.

684
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:35,671
I don't want a relationship.

685
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,476
Well, you can't guarantee
that now, can you?

686
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,608
You might actually have some kind of

687
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:41,482
latent humanity that
you don't know anything about.

688
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:44,044
You might like being
in a relationship, and...

689
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,989
Listen, I said this was nice.
I didn't ask you to marry me.

690
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,789
Well, I wouldn't want to be
with someone who was sick, either.

691
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,335
I'm sorry.

692
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,338
- Sorry.
- No.

693
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:06,901
I just... I did that before,
and it didn't...

694
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:09,505
It wasn't good.

695
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,021
I'd just been diagnosed,

696
00:39:17,223 --> 00:39:19,020
and he was married.

697
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:23,189
He helped me, and it didn't end well. So...

698
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,494
It's Trey Hannigan, isn't it?

699
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:33,799
- Trey Hannigan? It was Trey Hannigan.
- Yeah, well...

700
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:39,570
Are you in love with him?

701
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:44,806
No, I'm not in love with Trey Hannigan.

702
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:46,978
I was never in love with Trey Hannigan.

703
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:50,384
He was... Said he was in love with me.

704
00:39:54,795 --> 00:39:57,127
Which was, you know, a problem.

705
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:07,772
- Can we just...
- Right, yeah.

706
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:09,307
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

707
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:10,674
- Please.
- Okay.

708
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:17,684
You get a special thank you
for bringing food.

709
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,179
I do?

710
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:21,182
Yes, you do.

711
00:40:23,525 --> 00:40:25,687
- You know what?
- What?

712
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:27,785
What?

713
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:29,627
I got to pee.

714
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,224
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

715
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:57,056
Just give me a second, okay?

716
00:40:57,226 --> 00:40:58,215
Okay.

717
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:21,144
Focus, focus, focus.

718
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:26,911
Should I keep going?

719
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,921
- This never happens.
- I'm aware.

720
00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:30,750
I'm serious. It doesn't.

721
00:41:30,961 --> 00:41:34,294
No, no, no. Don't worry about it.
It's me. I'm a jinx.

722
00:41:34,766 --> 00:41:35,994
That's really helpful.

723
00:41:36,067 --> 00:41:37,863
You know what? Why don't you
talk about all the other guys

724
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:40,802
that you slept with that couldn't get it up,
'cause then it would really like...

725
00:41:40,872 --> 00:41:42,362
Shh! Shh! Shh!

726
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:45,599
Just calm down.

727
00:41:46,944 --> 00:41:49,002
Just give me a minute.

728
00:41:50,948 --> 00:41:52,438
Don't worry about it.

729
00:41:52,517 --> 00:41:53,677
I am worried about it!

730
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:59,053
Jesus! Can you just please...
Just show me a little kindness?

731
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:01,384
Please.

732
00:42:02,026 --> 00:42:06,656
Oh, you lying sack of shit!
You do have latent humanity.

733
00:42:07,598 --> 00:42:11,330
- Do you know what's going on here?
- I just want to have sex.

734
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,402
Well, your body's telling you otherwise.

735
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:17,475
What is that supposed to mean?

736
00:42:19,945 --> 00:42:21,242
Sit up.

737
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:23,543
- I don't want to sit up.
- Come on. Sit up. Sit up. Sit up. Come on.

738
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:28,676
All right. Now talk to me.

739
00:42:29,154 --> 00:42:30,815
I don't want to talk.

740
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:34,086
What else are we going to do?
You've taken sex off the table.

741
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,286
Oh!

742
00:42:35,395 --> 00:42:38,056
Come on. Come on.
Tell me how your day was.

743
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,229
- My day?

744
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:44,830
So I sneak up to my room and
I white out the "D" so it looks like a "B,"

745
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:47,133
which I did flawlessly. It was undetectable.

746
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,031
And I go down to his study
and I hand him the paper.

747
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,135
And he gives me the face.

748
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:54,579
And I'm like, "What?"

749
00:42:56,516 --> 00:42:59,974
And then, from behind his back,
he pulls out the goddamn carbon copy

750
00:43:00,053 --> 00:43:02,044
- that the school sent home.
- Oh, no!

751
00:43:02,856 --> 00:43:04,654
- Yeah.
- Wow.

752
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:06,385
Genius. Genius.

753
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,356
- You're so competitive.
- No!

754
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,768
Yeah! Yes, you are. Oh, my God, I tell you

755
00:43:14,835 --> 00:43:17,325
I'm involved with Trey Hannigan
and you can't get it up.

756
00:43:17,837 --> 00:43:19,271
I could give a shit about Trey Hannigan.

757
00:43:20,107 --> 00:43:22,041
All you care about is beating him!

758
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:24,202
- Bullshit!
- You know, it's so prehistoric.

759
00:43:24,445 --> 00:43:26,640
All men care about is performance,

760
00:43:26,714 --> 00:43:28,341
but they have an appendage
that doesn't work

761
00:43:28,415 --> 00:43:30,815
if they're worried about performance.

762
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:33,377
Mmm. Well, you're an expert, so...

763
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:40,624
Okay. If I'm an expert,
then why is your company spending

764
00:43:40,694 --> 00:43:42,821
billions making a drug
so that guys can get it up?

765
00:43:42,897 --> 00:43:43,887
Oh, I wish.

766
00:43:44,132 --> 00:43:45,895
It's true. I read it.
Pfizer's making a fuck drug.

767
00:43:46,134 --> 00:43:47,964
Where'd you read that?

768
00:43:48,469 --> 00:43:49,732
I don't know. Ask your guys.

769
00:43:49,805 --> 00:43:52,864
I don't know where I read it.
I'm a drug slut. I read everything.

770
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,674
- What drug?
- I don't know,

771
00:43:54,743 --> 00:43:56,074
but it's hard to believe, isn't it?

772
00:43:57,479 --> 00:43:59,413
It's hard to believe.

773
00:44:00,348 --> 00:44:02,373
- It's gonna be pretty huge, though.
- Oh!

774
00:44:02,984 --> 00:44:06,977
When I think of the size of the problem

775
00:44:07,255 --> 00:44:10,554
and that it's growing larger, really...

776
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:12,490
- Really.
- I can't even imagine!

777
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:13,790
You know what I think...

778
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:15,228
To have found a solution
to the stiffest, hardest...

779
00:44:15,298 --> 00:44:16,286
Wow.

780
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:19,857
- Pfizer must be swelling with pride.
- I'm gonna stop you.

781
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:21,560
No tickling! Stop!

782
00:44:21,637 --> 00:44:23,832
Stop! No tickling! No, please!

783
00:44:23,906 --> 00:44:26,568
Don't tickle me just
because you have a limp sense of humor!

784
00:44:26,642 --> 00:44:27,631
Oh!

785
00:44:37,353 --> 00:44:38,548
Hello.

786
00:44:42,992 --> 00:44:44,460
Keep talking.

787
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:46,119
No more talking.

788
00:45:01,378 --> 00:45:03,744
Who are all these old people?

789
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:07,281
Uh... Just some people I work with.

790
00:45:08,786 --> 00:45:11,219
Wow. These are beautiful.

791
00:45:12,322 --> 00:45:13,756
It looks like a photograph.

792
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:15,591
When did you do this?

793
00:45:19,464 --> 00:45:21,761
Back when I could hold a brush.

794
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:24,498
Here's your breakfast.

795
00:45:27,337 --> 00:45:29,101
- Thanks.
- Yeah, well...

796
00:45:33,578 --> 00:45:35,375
I'll call you.

797
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:38,676
- Don't.
- I will.

798
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,239
I'm not kidding.

799
00:45:44,456 --> 00:45:47,390
I can't do this.

800
00:45:50,496 --> 00:45:52,521
I told you.

801
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:02,402
Okay, then.

802
00:46:02,474 --> 00:46:04,601
See you.

803
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:13,883
Your problem is
you don't know how to close!

804
00:46:13,954 --> 00:46:16,319
You gotta tell the docs what they need.

805
00:46:16,388 --> 00:46:17,617
Somebody says no,
that's when the fun starts.

806
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,680
That means you are in.

807
00:46:18,758 --> 00:46:21,089
- My numbers are up.
- Your Zithromax is up. Big deal.

808
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,152
We're not going to Chicago on Zithromax.

809
00:46:23,229 --> 00:46:25,493
Depressed people, Randall,
they're depressed every day.

810
00:46:25,565 --> 00:46:26,553
You gotta move Zoloft.

811
00:46:26,632 --> 00:46:29,227
- I want you to focus on Zoloft.
- Zoloft.

812
00:46:29,302 --> 00:46:32,863
Counseling? Here's some counseling.
Stop being a fucking bitch.

813
00:46:32,939 --> 00:46:34,668
Wait, did I use "you" language?

814
00:46:34,741 --> 00:46:35,799
Trial separation.

815
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:38,742
I'm so sorry. I need to own my feelings.

816
00:46:38,812 --> 00:46:39,836
Fucking pepperoni.

817
00:46:39,913 --> 00:46:40,902
Let me rephrase that.

818
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:44,041
I feel that you should stop
being a fucking bitch!

819
00:46:46,186 --> 00:46:48,519
So, I hear we're coming out
with a new sex drug.

820
00:46:48,856 --> 00:46:50,914
- What are you talking about?
- Is it true?

821
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:53,825
- Where did you hear that?
- Heard it around.

822
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,885
Sildenafil citrate. It's a PDE-5 inhibitor.

823
00:46:56,964 --> 00:46:59,455
They lucked into it during trials
for blood pressure medication.

824
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:02,661
Guys had massive boners the whole time.
Where did you hear that?

825
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,329
- What's it called?
- Viagra.

826
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,168
- I want it.
- Everybody wants it.

827
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,229
I could sell the shit out of it.

828
00:47:07,308 --> 00:47:09,833
Can you see if there's some Tums
in there for me in the glove compartment?

829
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,275
- Bruce.
- Tums me, buddy.

830
00:47:11,345 --> 00:47:12,540
Bruce.

831
00:47:12,614 --> 00:47:15,047
Bruce. I want that account.

832
00:47:15,649 --> 00:47:17,083
Why would I give it to you?

833
00:47:17,152 --> 00:47:19,847
Who can sell a dick drug better than me?

834
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:22,956
Ten years, Jamie,
ten excruciating years of marriage.

835
00:47:23,025 --> 00:47:24,652
It's like the lost decade.

836
00:47:24,726 --> 00:47:26,625
Oh, my God!

837
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:28,993
I don't even know
how to hit on women anymore.

838
00:47:29,064 --> 00:47:30,088
What do you do? What's your game?

839
00:47:30,165 --> 00:47:31,495
You need an IBS.
Do you know what that is?

840
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:32,590
Irritable Bowel Syndrome?

841
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:33,656
An Initial Benefit Statement.

842
00:47:33,735 --> 00:47:35,965
Tell them who you are, why you're there
and what you can do for them.

843
00:47:36,038 --> 00:47:37,027
All right? And just be yourself, Josh.

844
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:38,697
- You'll be fine.
- Thank you very much.

845
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,908
Oh! Look who just walked in.

846
00:47:42,145 --> 00:47:43,907
Now's your chance, "Closer."

847
00:47:43,979 --> 00:47:45,003
Show me what you got.

848
00:47:48,151 --> 00:47:49,139
Show me.

849
00:47:49,484 --> 00:47:52,010
Hey! Pfizer, how's your fist?

850
00:47:52,088 --> 00:47:53,077
How's your jaw?

851
00:47:54,556 --> 00:47:56,251
Randall, you know Stan Knight, right?

852
00:47:56,324 --> 00:47:58,850
Stan, this is a bright young man
from Pfizer.

853
00:47:58,928 --> 00:48:00,122
Yes, we've met.

854
00:48:00,196 --> 00:48:01,356
- Yeah. How you doing?
- Fantastic.

855
00:48:01,431 --> 00:48:04,195
New study on Zoloft,
25% fewer side effects than Prozac.

856
00:48:04,267 --> 00:48:06,098
So, I'm feeling good.

857
00:48:06,169 --> 00:48:08,000
You'd do better selling him
if you got him laid.

858
00:48:08,071 --> 00:48:09,402
Can you get me laid?

859
00:48:10,406 --> 00:48:13,102
Stan's one of the more respected
diagnosticians in town,

860
00:48:13,176 --> 00:48:14,768
but his real calling is pussy-hound.

861
00:48:14,844 --> 00:48:16,904
Yes, and I think your real calling is pimp.

862
00:48:17,414 --> 00:48:19,574
Now, you're banging Maggie Murdock,
aren't you?

863
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:21,274
Are.

864
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:22,409
You are.

865
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:25,045
Oh, God, those tits are unbelievable!

866
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:26,589
- So not fair!
- All right.

867
00:48:26,657 --> 00:48:30,148
No, no. You don't see that a lot
in the neurologically damned.

868
00:48:30,226 --> 00:48:32,422
What do you mean, "damned"?
You don't die from Parkinson's.

869
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:34,293
Well, it's not much of a life, now is it?

870
00:48:34,364 --> 00:48:35,955
What do you mean? Interferon, L-dopa...

871
00:48:36,032 --> 00:48:37,591
It slowed the progress
in the majority of cases.

872
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:38,965
Listen, Dr. Drug Rep.

873
00:48:39,036 --> 00:48:41,369
You know less than shit, okay?
She's a sick girl.

874
00:48:41,439 --> 00:48:43,338
Oh. Is that what you told your wife?

875
00:48:43,407 --> 00:48:44,669
That's none of your fucking business.

876
00:48:44,741 --> 00:48:46,403
Maggie has all sorts of needs,

877
00:48:46,478 --> 00:48:48,342
and I don't think a pussy like you
is up for the job.

878
00:48:48,412 --> 00:48:49,470
Right, and a married man is?

879
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:51,139
- Whoa, whoa!
- You really want me to hit you again?

880
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:54,517
Chill out, man! Chill.
Wait! Don't get aggressive.

881
00:48:54,585 --> 00:48:56,213
Don't get aggressive. Hey!

882
00:48:56,287 --> 00:48:58,346
Whoa! Baby, okay. It's okay.

883
00:48:58,423 --> 00:48:59,912
Inter-fucking-feron, really?

884
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,185
- You know what?
- Hey.

885
00:49:01,259 --> 00:49:02,248
Easy, easy.

886
00:49:02,327 --> 00:49:03,954
- I'm going home.
- No, you're not.

887
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:07,623
- No, no, no. I'm going home.
- Good. Say hi to your wife.

888
00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:08,791
I'm keeping my eyes on you, buddy.

889
00:49:10,401 --> 00:49:12,164
That freaked me out.

890
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:16,166
He actually, physically hit you, didn't he?

891
00:49:16,242 --> 00:49:18,402
Yeah, he did, and I was afraid
he was going to do it again.

892
00:49:18,476 --> 00:49:20,501
He might have to up his meds,
that young man.

893
00:49:20,612 --> 00:49:23,172
Or maybe he needs to change to
a drug that's proven more effective

894
00:49:23,248 --> 00:49:25,079
in controlling aggressive behavior.

895
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:30,919
Zoloft produced 13% fewer outbursts
in a controlled study of adult males.

896
00:49:31,257 --> 00:49:32,986
And I think it's...

897
00:49:33,058 --> 00:49:34,116
Turn to your left.

898
00:49:34,193 --> 00:49:35,990
Turn to your left right now.
Turn to your left.

899
00:49:36,762 --> 00:49:38,195
Those two women, I know both of them.

900
00:49:38,264 --> 00:49:39,925
Which one do you want to take home?

901
00:49:42,568 --> 00:49:46,096
You're a superstar. Confidence is king.

902
00:49:46,939 --> 00:49:51,001
Hey. What do you say we blow this joint,
and then each other?

903
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:53,304
Okay.

904
00:49:54,113 --> 00:49:55,445
Thank you.

905
00:49:58,051 --> 00:49:59,312
We ready?

906
00:49:59,385 --> 00:50:01,013
- You okay, champ?
- No.

907
00:50:05,859 --> 00:50:07,349
What are you doing? Are you calling her?

908
00:50:10,297 --> 00:50:12,265
Hey, did she go down on you?

909
00:50:12,332 --> 00:50:14,823
Farrah looks at my dick
like it's the Eye of Sauron.

910
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:17,959
Hello?

911
00:50:18,471 --> 00:50:19,802
Did you call me?

912
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,804
No. I did not call you.

913
00:50:22,142 --> 00:50:23,803
I think you did.

914
00:50:24,044 --> 00:50:25,945
And what would I have said
if I had called you?

915
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,878
That you want to see me?

916
00:50:28,315 --> 00:50:31,547
Well, that would be nice,
except I didn't call you.

917
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:32,643
Do you want to see me?

918
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,913
I'm hanging up now.

919
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:37,321
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

920
00:50:40,027 --> 00:50:41,016
Why?

921
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:45,956
I like hearing the sound of your voice.

922
00:50:52,406 --> 00:50:53,600
Bye, Randall.

923
00:50:53,674 --> 00:50:54,937
Maggie!

924
00:50:58,713 --> 00:51:02,445
You like hearing the sound of her voice?

925
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,074
Shut up.

926
00:51:04,151 --> 00:51:07,417
Do you have a brain tumor?
Were you molested by a Care Bear?

927
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,318
Were you abducted by aliens?

928
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:10,415
You hate women.

929
00:51:10,492 --> 00:51:12,960
Why else would you
screw so many of them?

930
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,258
It's time for you to overdose.

931
00:51:15,497 --> 00:51:17,124
Oh! Oh!

932
00:51:17,232 --> 00:51:18,995
Oh, she rejected you!

933
00:51:19,067 --> 00:51:20,831
That's why you want her.

934
00:51:20,903 --> 00:51:22,927
It's the first time in history
that's ever happened.

935
00:51:23,005 --> 00:51:24,233
Excuse me. Excuse me.

936
00:51:24,306 --> 00:51:26,207
I was wondering something.
Aren't you rich?

937
00:51:26,276 --> 00:51:28,402
Why are you sleeping on my couch?

938
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,078
You're my big brother.

939
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:36,707
Here.

940
00:51:37,253 --> 00:51:40,313
For people who never entered puberty.
Take six.

941
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:43,648
All right.

942
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:47,552
- You all right?
- Can I pay by check?

943
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,997
Sam, remember I told you
that the pharmacies only take cash?

944
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:52,967
Maggie! Mag!

945
00:51:53,803 --> 00:51:55,499
Um... But, listen,
why don't you just get on the bus,

946
00:51:55,572 --> 00:51:57,038
we'll work it out there.
Okay? All right. Good.

947
00:51:57,106 --> 00:51:58,630
Maggie, I want to talk to you.

948
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:00,574
I can't talk right now, all right?

949
00:52:00,644 --> 00:52:02,508
- I'm getting on a bus to Canada.
- Canada?

950
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:03,738
Yes. Yes, Canada.

951
00:52:03,813 --> 00:52:05,782
These people can't afford
to pay for their prescriptions here.

952
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:07,680
Maggie, will we have bathroom breaks?

953
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:10,083
Sophie, remember I told you
that there's a bathroom on the bus?

954
00:52:10,154 --> 00:52:12,088
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

955
00:52:12,156 --> 00:52:14,420
- Okay. When do you get back?
- Never.

956
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:17,624
- Tomorrow night, late.
- How late?

957
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:21,654
Just forget about it, okay? Please?
I'm begging you.

958
00:52:29,074 --> 00:52:30,166
Why don't you take a pen?

959
00:52:30,241 --> 00:52:32,174
I'll send you a pamphlet
and an efficacy statement, okay?

960
00:52:32,242 --> 00:52:34,234
What time is it, do you know?

961
00:52:34,346 --> 00:52:37,247
Wow. Okay, I got to go.
I'll give you a call, okay?

962
00:52:59,905 --> 00:53:01,133
...know.

963
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:04,233
Know how to handle large sums of money

964
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,244
with harmony and with love,

965
00:53:06,312 --> 00:53:09,645
and that the truth is
that you have high ideals,

966
00:53:09,715 --> 00:53:13,150
and that you are a person
of great personal integrity,

967
00:53:13,218 --> 00:53:17,519
and you will keep your mind focused
upon financial prosperity.

968
00:53:32,104 --> 00:53:35,040
Looks like you got
all your stuff, right? Okay. Good.

969
00:53:35,108 --> 00:53:37,769
- You guys travel home safe.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

970
00:53:37,843 --> 00:53:39,334
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

971
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:42,011
- Bye, Maggie!
- Bye.

972
00:54:03,704 --> 00:54:04,932
Hi.

973
00:54:06,873 --> 00:54:09,365
When you end it, I get to hate you,

974
00:54:09,444 --> 00:54:12,571
and act all cold,
and tell embarrassing stuff to my friends.

975
00:54:12,846 --> 00:54:13,836
Okay.

976
00:54:13,915 --> 00:54:15,644
And you don't get to move in,

977
00:54:15,716 --> 00:54:18,776
or become friends with my friends,
or introduce me to your parents.

978
00:54:18,853 --> 00:54:20,787
This is what this is, whatever this is.

979
00:54:20,855 --> 00:54:21,879
Are you done?

980
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:23,688
Have you been here all night?

981
00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:25,123
Yes.

982
00:54:30,064 --> 00:54:31,725
Oh, Christ!

983
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,098
Why am I mad at you already?

984
00:55:17,145 --> 00:55:20,377
Oh, Jamie. It's Brucie.
You want to meet me?

985
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,783
I've got a load of love in my trunk for you.
Something you're going to like.

986
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:25,252
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

987
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,688
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
Call me, call me, call me.

988
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:28,985
You're gonna love me, love me...

989
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:32,885
Ah!

990
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:35,727
Jamie, it's Bruce. Where are you?

991
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:37,197
Who are you?

992
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:43,335
Let the games begin!

993
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,505
Make it hot! Make it hot!

994
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,145
Men with diabetes,
men with prostate cancer,

995
00:55:59,223 --> 00:56:01,123
men with massive penile injuries.

996
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:05,059
Men with performance anxiety,
men with any common form of impotence

997
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:06,721
or sexual dysfunction.

998
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:09,494
Men without a useful erection in years!

999
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:11,395
Boing!

1000
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:14,905
Minimum side effects, long-term safety.
This isn't a pill.

1001
00:56:14,973 --> 00:56:17,908
This is a revolution. Questions?

1002
00:56:17,976 --> 00:56:19,375
Yeah. Where are the samples?

1003
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:21,378
Right here, baby. Right here.

1004
00:56:21,446 --> 00:56:24,244
You sure you want one? You want two?
Who wants two?

1005
00:56:24,316 --> 00:56:27,979
Did you see this? Bob Dole says
his TV commercials for Viagra

1006
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:30,851
won't hurt his wife's campaign
for President.

1007
00:56:30,922 --> 00:56:32,652
He also says the Viagra commercials

1008
00:56:32,725 --> 00:56:36,251
won't hurt his campaign
to nail Heather Locklear.

1009
00:56:36,328 --> 00:56:38,729
The dick drug! That's my brother's!

1010
00:56:39,065 --> 00:56:41,926
Oh, my God!

1011
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:47,132
Viagra, the little pill that has started
a gold rush for its manufacturer,

1012
00:56:47,206 --> 00:56:48,867
the drug giant Pfizer.

1013
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:53,005
Jamie! Jamie! Hey!

1014
00:56:53,346 --> 00:56:55,507
- Ted Goldstein, ENT.
- Oh, Ted, hi. How are you?

1015
00:56:55,581 --> 00:56:58,448
I'm good. Look, I got this friend,
he's a radiologist.

1016
00:56:58,517 --> 00:57:00,644
He has a little problem. I thought maybe...

1017
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,120
Say no more.

1018
00:57:03,123 --> 00:57:04,180
You're a gem.

1019
00:57:04,256 --> 00:57:07,021
Viagra is the first-ever pill
to treat impotence.

1020
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:10,256
It's easy, it's effective,
and it's now wildly in demand.

1021
00:57:13,367 --> 00:57:15,300
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

1022
00:57:15,368 --> 00:57:17,166
Oncologists are writing it,
shrinks are writing it,

1023
00:57:17,237 --> 00:57:19,034
gastroenterologists are writing it.

1024
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:21,198
Pediatricians are writing it for themselves!

1025
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,471
I mean, pharmacies could
stay open 24 hours

1026
00:57:23,543 --> 00:57:24,703
and they still couldn't meet the demand.

1027
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:26,542
We're running 1,200 prescriptions a month.

1028
00:57:26,614 --> 00:57:29,548
That's more than my entire year's quota!
And you don't care.

1029
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:33,052
About a bunch of old guys
with stiffies? Nope.

1030
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,712
How can you be so callous?

1031
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:38,054
Men are suffering worldwide
from shame and...

1032
00:57:43,564 --> 00:57:45,622
And frustration.

1033
00:57:50,904 --> 00:57:53,533
Oh, you're my little blue pill.

1034
00:57:55,209 --> 00:57:56,540
Oh, for God's sake.

1035
00:57:56,611 --> 00:57:58,738
No. What about this do you think is okay?

1036
00:57:58,813 --> 00:58:01,874
What are you...
I don't want to see this! No.

1037
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:03,280
What the fuck are you doing?

1038
00:58:03,351 --> 00:58:06,082
- No, no, no! This is too much information.
- I just need this.

1039
00:58:06,155 --> 00:58:08,418
Are you fucking filming it?

1040
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:10,480
Do you do, like, close-ups and shit?

1041
00:58:13,262 --> 00:58:14,751
Who holds it?

1042
00:58:26,341 --> 00:58:27,330
Hey.

1043
00:58:30,279 --> 00:58:31,508
Wake up.

1044
00:58:31,581 --> 00:58:32,979
Oh!

1045
00:58:34,049 --> 00:58:35,038
Again?

1046
00:58:40,322 --> 00:58:41,312
Maggie!

1047
00:58:43,059 --> 00:58:46,722
Come on. I'm an artist. This is work.

1048
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:49,563
Oh, my God.

1049
00:58:49,631 --> 00:58:51,122
Say something.

1050
00:58:53,837 --> 00:58:55,031
You're just too weird.

1051
00:58:55,105 --> 00:58:56,265
Yeah, well...

1052
00:58:59,142 --> 00:59:02,270
Hi, there. Jamie Randall here.

1053
00:59:02,979 --> 00:59:08,042
Just reporting from bed,
having just fucked my girlfriend.

1054
00:59:08,618 --> 00:59:10,415
- And...
- Don't use that word.

1055
00:59:10,488 --> 00:59:12,752
What? You use "fuck" all the time.

1056
00:59:12,823 --> 00:59:15,017
No, not "fucking." "Girlfriend."

1057
00:59:16,327 --> 00:59:17,658
That's what you are.

1058
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:23,157
I am?

1059
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:25,793
Yeah, you are.

1060
00:59:28,172 --> 00:59:29,969
I guess I am.

1061
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:35,506
Jesus.

1062
01:00:48,321 --> 01:00:49,379
No, Mom.

1063
01:00:49,455 --> 01:00:53,551
No, it's not an aphrodisiac.
It's a vasodilator.

1064
01:00:53,626 --> 01:00:56,255
A vasodilator. No, Ma...

1065
01:00:57,698 --> 01:00:59,859
No, just... No, I...

1066
01:01:00,601 --> 01:01:03,229
Yeah, I've already sold
2,000 prescriptions this month alone.

1067
01:01:03,837 --> 01:01:04,827
It's a lot of money.

1068
01:01:06,773 --> 01:01:10,301
Okay, I really can't talk.
Maggie needs me.

1069
01:01:10,378 --> 01:01:11,537
Okay, bye.

1070
01:01:13,347 --> 01:01:16,283
I thought you said
it was 1,200 prescriptions.

1071
01:01:17,651 --> 01:01:18,640
It is.

1072
01:01:21,222 --> 01:01:23,314
Well, why did you tell her 2,000?

1073
01:01:24,258 --> 01:01:25,248
Did I?

1074
01:01:27,962 --> 01:01:29,019
Are you kidding?

1075
01:01:30,198 --> 01:01:31,790
I don't know, it just sounded better.

1076
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,630
You told your mother a lie
because it sounds better?

1077
01:01:36,704 --> 01:01:40,573
Look, she doesn't know numbers.

1078
01:01:40,642 --> 01:01:42,974
Do you tell me lies
because they sound better?

1079
01:01:43,211 --> 01:01:44,270
No!

1080
01:01:44,346 --> 01:01:45,335
Well, why did you do it with her?

1081
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:47,438
Because she wants to
know that I'm doing well...

1082
01:01:47,515 --> 01:01:49,073
Okay, but you are doing well,

1083
01:01:49,151 --> 01:01:51,142
so why do you need
to make it sound better?

1084
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,414
Okay, you know what?

1085
01:01:53,488 --> 01:01:56,287
I will call her back up right now,
and I will correct my mistake.

1086
01:01:56,358 --> 01:01:57,484
Okay?

1087
01:02:00,996 --> 01:02:02,896
Tell me four good things about yourself.

1088
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:06,361
Excuse me?

1089
01:02:07,202 --> 01:02:08,191
You heard me.

1090
01:02:09,806 --> 01:02:11,204
Okay.

1091
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:15,006
Four good things about myself.

1092
01:02:15,845 --> 01:02:17,505
I can...

1093
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:21,311
Why are we doing this?

1094
01:02:21,384 --> 01:02:22,907
This is just... I don't...

1095
01:02:22,985 --> 01:02:25,420
You can't even think
of four good things about yourself.

1096
01:02:25,488 --> 01:02:26,512
What? I totally can!

1097
01:02:26,589 --> 01:02:28,021
Do you think that you're generous?

1098
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,518
Do you think you're sweet?

1099
01:02:34,698 --> 01:02:35,858
Not particularly.

1100
01:02:35,932 --> 01:02:37,229
Do you think that you're smart?

1101
01:02:38,368 --> 01:02:40,199
Oh, my God!

1102
01:02:42,205 --> 01:02:43,696
Look at you.

1103
01:02:47,043 --> 01:02:48,374
You're this

1104
01:02:49,213 --> 01:02:50,703
talented,

1105
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:57,816
charming, handsome, capable,
determined, smart man.

1106
01:03:03,227 --> 01:03:04,558
I am?

1107
01:03:06,731 --> 01:03:08,198
Yes, you are.

1108
01:03:17,408 --> 01:03:18,398
I can juggle.

1109
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,413
- Does it make it longer?
- Time or inches?

1110
01:03:25,484 --> 01:03:27,849
- How come we can't take it?
- You can.

1111
01:03:27,918 --> 01:03:29,853
Are you saying
that we can get hard?

1112
01:03:29,921 --> 01:03:32,412
There is some indication
of increased lubrication.

1113
01:03:34,326 --> 01:03:37,056
- If they come inside you, does it burn?
- No.

1114
01:03:37,129 --> 01:03:39,120
How about in your mouth?

1115
01:03:39,931 --> 01:03:42,092
Jamie, we want more Viagra!

1116
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:44,033
- More! More Viagra!
- More Viagra!

1117
01:03:46,104 --> 01:03:48,573
Stan! Come here. Come over here!

1118
01:03:48,641 --> 01:03:52,542
Ladies, this is Dr. Stan Knight,
king of all internists.

1119
01:03:52,611 --> 01:03:54,375
Right? And this is...

1120
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:56,039
Cassie.

1121
01:03:56,115 --> 01:03:58,276
But my friends call me Lisa.

1122
01:03:59,218 --> 01:04:01,448
Lisa wants to marry a doctor, so good luck.

1123
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:02,851
Oh, dear.

1124
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,015
Ladies, next round is on me! Okay?

1125
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,087
Nice jacket, man.

1126
01:04:36,156 --> 01:04:37,783
Did you get laid?

1127
01:04:38,158 --> 01:04:39,318
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1128
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:41,454
- Six times.
- Mmm.

1129
01:04:41,895 --> 01:04:43,988
I was scared that you were.

1130
01:04:45,732 --> 01:04:47,199
You're crazy.

1131
01:05:02,851 --> 01:05:03,840
What?

1132
01:05:04,853 --> 01:05:05,911
Is everything okay?

1133
01:05:06,521 --> 01:05:08,682
Jamie... Honey?

1134
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:11,590
- Honey, your heart's beating really fast.
- I know.

1135
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,021
What's...

1136
01:05:13,761 --> 01:05:16,229
Jamie. Jamie. Jamie. Jamie.

1137
01:05:17,399 --> 01:05:19,229
Jamie. It's okay. It's okay.

1138
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,324
Talk to me.

1139
01:05:21,202 --> 01:05:22,191
I...

1140
01:05:22,872 --> 01:05:23,861
I...

1141
01:05:24,106 --> 01:05:26,835
Okay, you know what? Just breathe.
Don't even worry about it.

1142
01:05:26,908 --> 01:05:28,308
Just breathe.

1143
01:05:28,711 --> 01:05:30,372
It's okay.

1144
01:05:31,779 --> 01:05:32,838
I...

1145
01:05:35,684 --> 01:05:37,515
- I love you.
- What?

1146
01:05:40,322 --> 01:05:41,721
Just give me a second, okay?

1147
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:43,889
Oh, God, I do.

1148
01:05:45,594 --> 01:05:46,583
Uh...

1149
01:05:47,063 --> 01:05:48,723
- No, you don't.
- Don't touch me!

1150
01:05:48,797 --> 01:05:50,128
Okay.
Do you want a glass of water?

1151
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:51,188
I'm sorry.

1152
01:05:51,267 --> 01:05:53,259
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

1153
01:05:53,336 --> 01:05:55,030
- A little water?
- Yeah, water.

1154
01:05:56,872 --> 01:05:57,862
Oh, yeah.

1155
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:01,536
Okay, see? Here you go. Here you go.

1156
01:06:02,646 --> 01:06:03,704
Okay.

1157
01:06:09,786 --> 01:06:11,982
- I love you. I can't stop saying it.
- You don't...

1158
01:06:12,056 --> 01:06:15,320
- Just stop saying that, okay?
- I can't. I love you.

1159
01:06:16,393 --> 01:06:17,383
You don't understand.

1160
01:06:18,528 --> 01:06:20,325
I've never said that to anyone before.

1161
01:06:22,133 --> 01:06:24,657
- You've never said "I love you"?
- No.

1162
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:27,401
You never said it to your parents?

1163
01:06:30,974 --> 01:06:31,999
No.

1164
01:06:32,076 --> 01:06:33,839
- You never said it to your brother?
- Ugh!

1165
01:06:34,078 --> 01:06:35,977
Jesus, you're more fucked up than I am.

1166
01:06:37,815 --> 01:06:39,783
I once said it to a cat.

1167
01:06:42,086 --> 01:06:44,577
- Okay, that makes me feel better.
- It does? Okay, good.

1168
01:06:44,655 --> 01:06:46,418
You can hold me now.

1169
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:48,016
Okay.

1170
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,090
Oh!

1171
01:06:59,271 --> 01:07:00,464
Joshie!

1172
01:07:05,943 --> 01:07:07,935
That is disgusting.

1173
01:07:08,113 --> 01:07:11,378
Jamie, I didn't know
you were coming home!

1174
01:07:12,484 --> 01:07:13,815
Oh!

1175
01:07:16,489 --> 01:07:17,887
Hey.

1176
01:07:17,956 --> 01:07:21,153
Listen, it's not what it looks like, okay?

1177
01:07:21,227 --> 01:07:22,751
Well, it kind of is, but...

1178
01:07:22,829 --> 01:07:24,125
Okay, just chill.

1179
01:07:24,196 --> 01:07:25,595
Yeah, chill. Oh, I'm sorry,

1180
01:07:25,664 --> 01:07:28,361
I thought I just caught my brother
masturbating while watching me have sex.

1181
01:07:28,867 --> 01:07:30,960
Well, I was focusing on her.

1182
01:07:31,204 --> 01:07:32,364
Oh, "her."

1183
01:07:32,472 --> 01:07:34,463
- You mean my girlfriend! I'm sorry.
- No.

1184
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,303
Not on her!

1185
01:07:36,376 --> 01:07:39,675
On her body parts!
Does video make everything look bigger?

1186
01:07:39,746 --> 01:07:42,180
Because I didn't think
her tits were that big.

1187
01:07:42,248 --> 01:07:43,738
Then I saw you,

1188
01:07:43,816 --> 01:07:46,411
and I was like, "What,
did an anaconda get loose on the bed?"

1189
01:07:46,487 --> 01:07:47,510
This is so twisted.

1190
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:50,521
Do you think Dad's big?
I mean, he was when we were kids,

1191
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:54,321
but then everything's bigger
when you're a kid, right?

1192
01:07:55,662 --> 01:07:57,824
Fine! Okay? Sorry!

1193
01:07:58,165 --> 01:07:59,256
My self-esteem would prefer

1194
01:07:59,332 --> 01:08:02,734
that you not have a bigger penis
than me right now, that's all!

1195
01:08:02,803 --> 01:08:04,269
Shh! Shh!

1196
01:08:06,507 --> 01:08:07,974
Don't be mad.

1197
01:08:11,745 --> 01:08:14,009
Run, Josh. Run, Josh.

1198
01:08:14,081 --> 01:08:15,480
Run, Joshie.

1199
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:19,246
We can talk about this like men!
Ow! You're gonna ruin the tape!

1200
01:08:20,087 --> 01:08:23,454
No normal human being
can possibly fit in this back seat.

1201
01:08:23,524 --> 01:08:25,116
That definition excludes you, Josh.

1202
01:08:25,192 --> 01:08:28,184
I'd literally be more comfortable
in the back of a Hot Wheels right now.

1203
01:08:28,462 --> 01:08:30,829
I've lost all feeling in my legs.

1204
01:08:33,635 --> 01:08:35,124
- Are you okay?
- No!

1205
01:08:35,202 --> 01:08:37,364
I'm not talking to you, Josh.

1206
01:08:38,106 --> 01:08:39,539
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1207
01:08:39,607 --> 01:08:40,767
Okay.

1208
01:10:16,941 --> 01:10:18,067
He's waiting for you.

1209
01:10:18,142 --> 01:10:20,975
- So, how are you doing?
- Fine. How's Maggie?

1210
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:26,377
Come in!

1211
01:10:27,418 --> 01:10:28,942
- Whoa!
- No, come in, come in.

1212
01:10:33,357 --> 01:10:34,518
Testosterone, man.

1213
01:10:34,827 --> 01:10:38,455
Chicago's in two days. I must prepare.

1214
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,859
It's a fucking orgy
masquerading as a medical convention.

1215
01:10:41,934 --> 01:10:44,128
- You're coming, aren't you?
- I don't know.

1216
01:10:44,703 --> 01:10:47,365
- Oh, right. How's she doing?
- She's great.

1217
01:10:47,673 --> 01:10:49,504
Well, I'm not. I need a break.

1218
01:10:49,908 --> 01:10:51,842
HMOs are killing me. Killing me!

1219
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:55,573
I need a lot of loosely moraled women
to throw themselves at me. Hard.

1220
01:10:55,848 --> 01:10:57,645
Speaking of which...

1221
01:10:58,684 --> 01:11:01,051
Oh, you are a god! You're a god, sir!

1222
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,347
You're really not coming to this?

1223
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:03,752
You could do something for me.

1224
01:11:04,156 --> 01:11:05,146
Yeah, what's that?

1225
01:11:05,425 --> 01:11:07,688
You could start prescribing Zoloft
instead of Prozac.

1226
01:11:08,927 --> 01:11:10,054
Um...

1227
01:11:11,431 --> 01:11:13,421
Well, Trey's a friend of mine, man.

1228
01:11:14,868 --> 01:11:16,358
I know. I know.

1229
01:11:18,505 --> 01:11:23,101
- Sure. Zoloft. Okay. Why not?
- Great.

1230
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,911
- Hey!
- Hey.

1231
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:32,781
How was your day?

1232
01:11:33,052 --> 01:11:34,384
Amazing.

1233
01:11:35,789 --> 01:11:36,777
Mmm?

1234
01:11:38,224 --> 01:11:39,556
You?

1235
01:11:39,627 --> 01:11:41,822
Me? My day was...

1236
01:11:41,896 --> 01:11:43,556
My day was swell.

1237
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:47,891
- I went to the clinic...
- You did?

1238
01:11:47,968 --> 01:11:49,902
...for a scrip

1239
01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:55,766
and waited for three hours sitting next
to a man with a fork stuck in his head.

1240
01:11:56,277 --> 01:11:57,471
- What?
- Yep.

1241
01:11:57,545 --> 01:12:02,915
And then I went
to the pharmacy to get the scrip filled.

1242
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:07,247
Which was closed,

1243
01:12:08,589 --> 01:12:10,820
so no meds for Maggie.

1244
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:19,924
Are you okay?

1245
01:12:22,837 --> 01:12:24,395
Why, do I look like shit?

1246
01:12:24,472 --> 01:12:25,769
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah.

1247
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,969
You didn't say. You didn't say it out loud.

1248
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:38,851
Thanks, I'd love one.

1249
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:43,622
Sorry.

1250
01:12:48,196 --> 01:12:50,563
You think maybe you've had enough?

1251
01:12:50,633 --> 01:12:53,296
Nope, I don't, but you do.

1252
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:54,959
Excuse me?

1253
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:58,474
Tell me, Randall, what exactly is it
about me that's so desirable?

1254
01:12:58,709 --> 01:13:02,303
There's going to be 600 girls
dying to blow you at this convention.

1255
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,707
- Well, I'm not going to the convention.
- Why not?

1256
01:13:04,848 --> 01:13:11,014
Go out with some sexy, limber
ex-cheerleader from Alabama,

1257
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,880
who's just dying to discuss
market projections and sales techniques.

1258
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:19,318
Or just a hot HMO administrator
who likes to bake cookies

1259
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:22,888
and rub your head
while you discuss the evils of generics.

1260
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:25,259
Or just, you know, I don't know,
a normal person,

1261
01:13:25,335 --> 01:13:28,737
who has energy and likes to do things
and have fun!

1262
01:13:28,806 --> 01:13:29,794
I happen to want you.

1263
01:13:29,873 --> 01:13:33,605
Why? Why? What are you trying to prove?

1264
01:13:34,078 --> 01:13:36,443
Are you trying to show
that you're not a flake?

1265
01:13:36,513 --> 01:13:40,677
Are you trying to stick with something
for once in your goddamn life?

1266
01:13:40,751 --> 01:13:43,186
I mean, you do realize
that you are not a good person

1267
01:13:43,254 --> 01:13:45,245
because you pity-fuck the sick girl, right?

1268
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:01,329
I almost went home with
someone from the clinic today.

1269
01:14:01,539 --> 01:14:02,700
All right.

1270
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:06,036
- There, you see?
- All right.

1271
01:14:07,211 --> 01:14:09,043
Don't forget your pager.

1272
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,149
Come with me to Chicago.

1273
01:14:56,096 --> 01:14:58,291
- Keith! How you doing, man?
- Jamie. Good.

1274
01:14:58,364 --> 01:15:00,525
So good to see you.
Everything going well?

1275
01:15:00,767 --> 01:15:04,100
I'm going to go off and do some girly thing,
whatever that is.

1276
01:15:04,437 --> 01:15:06,769
- How will I reach you?
- I'll beep you.

1277
01:15:09,609 --> 01:15:10,598
Stage One?

1278
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:12,771
I'm sorry?

1279
01:15:12,847 --> 01:15:14,280
My son's a Stage Three.

1280
01:15:14,782 --> 01:15:16,510
It's not obvious, don't worry.

1281
01:15:17,852 --> 01:15:19,183
We're across the street.

1282
01:15:20,488 --> 01:15:24,151
Whenever you get tired of this bullshit
and want to hear what's really going on...

1283
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:26,453
Thank you.

1284
01:15:36,303 --> 01:15:37,635
Fuck soup.

1285
01:15:37,873 --> 01:15:39,703
Fuck shoelaces.

1286
01:15:39,974 --> 01:15:42,705
Fuck jewelry. And fuck brushing teeth.

1287
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:47,809
- Fuck...
- Trying to tie your tie. Fuck...

1288
01:15:47,883 --> 01:15:49,077
Trying to button down a shirt.

1289
01:15:49,151 --> 01:15:51,482
And fuck that meditation shit.

1290
01:15:53,321 --> 01:15:57,781
And who knew God wanted us
to be so good

1291
01:15:57,893 --> 01:16:00,123
at giving hand jobs?

1292
01:16:03,165 --> 01:16:06,498
My husband is always smiling.

1293
01:16:17,013 --> 01:16:19,004
Parkinson's has made me

1294
01:16:20,415 --> 01:16:22,247
more sensitive and more compassionate.

1295
01:16:22,518 --> 01:16:27,251
Hopefully, got a long way to go in all this.
I feel good, and...

1296
01:16:27,423 --> 01:16:31,291
So, it's a constant battle of
trying to maintain some dignity

1297
01:16:31,361 --> 01:16:32,691
and grace in society.

1298
01:16:32,929 --> 01:16:36,092
And to overcome that,
you just live with what you have.

1299
01:16:46,543 --> 01:16:50,205
Offering to hold the kid for just a minute,
and he ends up in that tree over there.

1300
01:16:51,113 --> 01:16:55,107
One of my girlfriends asked me once
if she could get me anything.

1301
01:16:55,384 --> 01:16:59,048
I said, "How about a new brain?
Nothing fancy."

1302
01:16:59,289 --> 01:17:01,382
She said, "My husband's not using his."

1303
01:17:03,227 --> 01:17:04,717
Wait. Wait.

1304
01:17:05,729 --> 01:17:10,223
Never mind. Sorry.
I thought I heard a cure coming.

1305
01:17:14,471 --> 01:17:16,463
But there are good things.

1306
01:17:16,741 --> 01:17:21,405
You have to understand
that you're still yourself.

1307
01:17:21,746 --> 01:17:25,408
You're still there. And life goes on.

1308
01:17:26,084 --> 01:17:29,076
And life is beautiful. Thank you.

1309
01:17:37,095 --> 01:17:38,756
Parkinson's, right?

1310
01:17:39,597 --> 01:17:40,758
Oh, no. No.

1311
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:42,164
No, your wife.

1312
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,431
Girlfriend.

1313
01:17:46,438 --> 01:17:47,598
Stage One.

1314
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,602
Good days and bad days, huh?

1315
01:17:50,108 --> 01:17:51,599
Mostly good days.

1316
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,500
You?

1317
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,509
Wife. Since '73.

1318
01:17:56,282 --> 01:17:57,613
Stage Four.

1319
01:17:58,350 --> 01:17:59,942
You got any advice?

1320
01:18:00,185 --> 01:18:02,779
- You don't need my advice.
- Come on. I'm very trainable.

1321
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:08,488
My advice is to go upstairs,
pack your bags, and leave a nice note.

1322
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,289
Find yourself a healthy woman.

1323
01:18:12,631 --> 01:18:16,796
I love my wife. I do.
But I wouldn't do it over again.

1324
01:18:18,804 --> 01:18:20,636
The thing nobody tells you,

1325
01:18:20,707 --> 01:18:23,733
this disease will steal
everything you love in her.

1326
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:25,368
Her body, her smile, her mind.

1327
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:29,312
Sooner or later, she'll lose motor control.

1328
01:18:30,317 --> 01:18:33,150
Eventually, she won't even
be able to dress herself.

1329
01:18:33,219 --> 01:18:36,552
Then, the fun really begins.
Cleaning up her shit.

1330
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:39,322
Frozen face. Dementia.

1331
01:18:41,329 --> 01:18:43,228
It's not a disease, it's a Russian novel.

1332
01:18:47,234 --> 01:18:49,724
Look, I'm sorry. I'm out of line.

1333
01:18:51,172 --> 01:18:52,503
Hang in there.

1334
01:18:56,444 --> 01:18:59,435
Did you realize there are
other people with Parkinson's?

1335
01:18:59,779 --> 01:19:01,611
How remarkable!

1336
01:19:01,949 --> 01:19:04,611
Amazing people. People doing things.

1337
01:19:04,852 --> 01:19:09,050
Like this one woman runs marathons,
and another one scuba dives.

1338
01:19:09,123 --> 01:19:11,956
And they're pissed off
and they're tired of being marginalized.

1339
01:19:12,026 --> 01:19:13,687
Oh, my God, they are so cool!

1340
01:19:14,862 --> 01:19:17,160
I feel good. I feel really good.

1341
01:19:17,231 --> 01:19:18,596
I feel better than I
have felt in a long time,

1342
01:19:18,597 --> 01:19:19,962
and you brought me here.

1343
01:19:20,035 --> 01:19:23,367
I mean, okay, whatever,
it was the wrong convention, sure, but...

1344
01:19:24,305 --> 01:19:26,638
Jamie, I... Jamie.

1345
01:19:29,744 --> 01:19:31,906
- I have been such a bitch to you.
- Oh, no.

1346
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:35,040
And you didn't even run away.
How is that possible?

1347
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:37,308
It's like, this is...

1348
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:40,054
Like, the first time in my life that I've

1349
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:44,722
ever not felt alone.

1350
01:19:45,061 --> 01:19:48,655
That someone is there for me.
Do you know what that means?

1351
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:50,829
Oh, my God.

1352
01:19:54,737 --> 01:19:55,931
I love you.

1353
01:19:58,074 --> 01:19:59,062
I do.

1354
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:04,002
I love you. I love you, I love you.

1355
01:20:04,346 --> 01:20:06,178
I really love you.

1356
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:37,044
- Hey.
- Hey.

1357
01:20:37,114 --> 01:20:38,775
What are you doing?

1358
01:20:39,716 --> 01:20:40,876
Nothing.

1359
01:20:41,385 --> 01:20:42,875
I fell asleep.

1360
01:20:48,592 --> 01:20:50,356
A cure for Parkinson's?

1361
01:20:50,962 --> 01:20:52,223
That's what I'm asking.

1362
01:20:52,463 --> 01:20:53,555
Pfizer, I'm a GP.

1363
01:20:53,797 --> 01:20:57,733
Twenty universities, 15 teaching hospitals,
every major drug company,

1364
01:20:57,801 --> 01:20:59,633
and the goddamn NIH
are all working on this.

1365
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,599
And I'm sure the second they find it,

1366
01:21:01,673 --> 01:21:03,401
you're gonna be
the first in line to sell it to me.

1367
01:21:03,807 --> 01:21:05,969
Well, in the meantime, she gets worse.

1368
01:21:06,244 --> 01:21:09,509
What is this, General Hospital?
What do you want me to do?

1369
01:21:09,581 --> 01:21:10,980
I want you to feel bad about it, Stan.

1370
01:21:11,249 --> 01:21:13,683
If I felt bad about every patient
that I couldn't help,

1371
01:21:13,751 --> 01:21:14,912
then I don't make it through the day.

1372
01:21:14,987 --> 01:21:16,647
What are the cutting edge treatments?

1373
01:21:16,921 --> 01:21:19,117
I don't know.
You want me to get you a list?

1374
01:21:19,191 --> 01:21:20,590
Great. Tomorrow.

1375
01:21:23,595 --> 01:21:25,427
Pfizer, you're a nice kid.

1376
01:21:25,598 --> 01:21:28,931
You're starting to do well.
You sure you want to do this?

1377
01:21:29,101 --> 01:21:31,626
And a list of doctors,
and someone who I can contact at NIH.

1378
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:32,758
Thank you, Stan.

1379
01:21:34,607 --> 01:21:35,767
Sure.

1380
01:21:58,297 --> 01:21:59,526
See this green area here?

1381
01:22:01,801 --> 01:22:03,131
I'm sorry.

1382
01:22:06,773 --> 01:22:08,673
Tell me, anybody

1383
01:22:09,976 --> 01:22:11,307
You okay?

1384
01:22:16,383 --> 01:22:18,511
Take the Z-Pak. Okay?

1385
01:22:18,586 --> 01:22:19,575
Jesus!

1386
01:22:28,563 --> 01:22:30,827
I'm sorry, Mr. Randall.
That credit card is declined.

1387
01:22:34,068 --> 01:22:36,901
The benefits of chelation,
every toxic metal is removed.

1388
01:22:39,507 --> 01:22:40,940
We've achieved complete remission

1389
01:22:41,008 --> 01:22:43,239
in patients with
advanced metastatic cancer,

1390
01:22:44,011 --> 01:22:45,035
MS...

1391
01:22:45,246 --> 01:22:46,235
Fuck!

1392
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:47,847
...Parkinson's, lupus.

1393
01:22:48,684 --> 01:22:51,208
This therapy changes people's lives.

1394
01:22:51,686 --> 01:22:53,518
He forgot "world peace."

1395
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:57,489
Are you saying to me
that we flew 2,000 miles,

1396
01:22:57,558 --> 01:23:00,187
on our own nickel, so you can tell me
that our appointment's been postponed?

1397
01:23:01,262 --> 01:23:02,456
For two weeks?

1398
01:23:03,365 --> 01:23:05,265
I'd like to talk to Dr. Rosenblum, okay?

1399
01:23:05,767 --> 01:23:07,859
Do I look like I care?

1400
01:23:08,203 --> 01:23:11,695
I don't give a shit where he is!
I don't understand...

1401
01:23:13,275 --> 01:23:15,266
Get the head of the hospital on the phone.

1402
01:23:15,544 --> 01:23:17,569
We've arranged our entire schedule
around that,

1403
01:23:17,646 --> 01:23:18,671
and then you come and you tell me...

1404
01:23:18,748 --> 01:23:21,648
No, you don't understand. Okay?
We waited two weeks...

1405
01:23:22,017 --> 01:23:25,111
I would like to talk
to the head of the hospital about it.

1406
01:23:27,155 --> 01:23:28,145
Hey.

1407
01:23:30,993 --> 01:23:31,982
Hey.

1408
01:23:32,394 --> 01:23:34,192
- I am so fed up with those people.
- I want to go home.

1409
01:23:34,264 --> 01:23:35,754
Okay, look, we can do the test,
and then go home, okay?

1410
01:23:35,832 --> 01:23:36,889
Randall.

1411
01:23:36,965 --> 01:23:39,491
There's just all this red tape
and all this new protocol...

1412
01:23:39,569 --> 01:23:42,629
Don't try to sell me! Please! Okay?
I'm not going to get better.

1413
01:23:42,905 --> 01:23:46,568
- That's bullshit.
- This is bullshit. I'm tired and I'm bored.

1414
01:23:46,643 --> 01:23:48,236
What are you bored of?

1415
01:23:48,312 --> 01:23:50,745
Parkinson's isn't my life!
I have Parkinson's.

1416
01:23:50,813 --> 01:23:53,510
Why can't I just live my life
instead of becoming this project?

1417
01:23:53,584 --> 01:23:55,574
Do you know that
what's ahead of me is bad enough?

1418
01:23:55,818 --> 01:23:57,308
- Don't you want to get...
- No!

1419
01:23:57,588 --> 01:24:00,250
You want. This has become
way too important to you.

1420
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:02,117
What are you talking about?
Don't you want to get better?

1421
01:24:02,258 --> 01:24:06,752
Yes! Desperately! It's not going to happen.
All right? News flash, there's no cure.

1422
01:24:08,532 --> 01:24:11,194
Apparently you need to know
that I'll get better in order to love me.

1423
01:24:12,336 --> 01:24:13,598
That's insane.

1424
01:24:23,682 --> 01:24:25,672
You need to get your stuff
out of my apartment.

1425
01:24:26,116 --> 01:24:27,607
What the hell?

1426
01:24:28,286 --> 01:24:32,085
You're on the fast track, Randall.
Chicago, then management.

1427
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:33,917
Next stop, CEO.

1428
01:24:34,926 --> 01:24:36,620
You can't do that
with a sick person holding you back.

1429
01:24:36,694 --> 01:24:37,855
I can do anything I want.

1430
01:24:38,263 --> 01:24:39,594
I know.

1431
01:24:42,467 --> 01:24:44,128
You're a good man.

1432
01:24:44,703 --> 01:24:46,864
In fact, you're a wonderful man.

1433
01:24:46,938 --> 01:24:49,031
Much better
than you give yourself credit for.

1434
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:53,038
Nobody wants to be
the one who runs away.

1435
01:24:53,312 --> 01:24:55,802
- I'm not running away.
- It's not your choice.

1436
01:25:00,819 --> 01:25:04,051
Let's just go home.
We can even make love.

1437
01:25:07,727 --> 01:25:09,217
And then you have to leave.

1438
01:25:23,843 --> 01:25:25,174
This is so stupid.

1439
01:25:25,244 --> 01:25:26,336
Stop.

1440
01:25:31,217 --> 01:25:32,549
We don't have to do this.

1441
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:34,512
Good-bye.

1442
01:27:08,284 --> 01:27:10,844
Hi. You have reached M. Murdock.

1443
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:14,686
If I'm not picking up, it's probably
because I don't want to talk to you.

1444
01:27:18,461 --> 01:27:20,794
This is actually sad.

1445
01:27:21,865 --> 01:27:24,026
Are you trying to get it
in the actual garbage,

1446
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:25,659
or just around it, to piss it off?

1447
01:27:32,876 --> 01:27:34,537
Stan! What's up?

1448
01:27:34,811 --> 01:27:38,304
What's fucking up is your friend,
Lisa-Cassie, whatever her name is,

1449
01:27:38,382 --> 01:27:41,374
is having a pajama party
at some rich guy's house this evening.

1450
01:27:41,652 --> 01:27:42,744
Pajama party?

1451
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:43,809
What's a pajama party?

1452
01:27:44,221 --> 01:27:46,416
Is that, like, girls wearing pajamas?
Getting naked?

1453
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:51,484
I thought maybe you might bring by
a little vitamin V, some little men in blue.

1454
01:27:51,762 --> 01:27:54,993
Stan, I'd love to. I don't think I can.
I'm feeling a little...

1455
01:27:55,065 --> 01:27:56,055
What are you doing?

1456
01:27:56,134 --> 01:27:57,498
Yes, Stan, it's me, Jamie.

1457
01:27:57,568 --> 01:27:59,968
I'll totally be there. See you later. Bye.

1458
01:28:00,237 --> 01:28:02,206
Hey, you and I are going to a pajama party.

1459
01:28:02,273 --> 01:28:04,833
So, you should get ready,
'cause I'm in pajamas.

1460
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:06,802
I'm having second thoughts, Jamie.

1461
01:28:06,878 --> 01:28:08,640
I haven't been to a pajama party
since 4th grade.

1462
01:28:08,712 --> 01:28:10,179
What if people start
taking their clothes off?

1463
01:28:10,248 --> 01:28:12,773
Oh, my God! I didn't want
to come here in the first place.

1464
01:28:12,851 --> 01:28:13,943
You're the one who wanted to come.

1465
01:28:14,019 --> 01:28:15,213
Will people have to see me naked?

1466
01:28:15,287 --> 01:28:16,686
I can't even pee in front of other people.

1467
01:28:16,755 --> 01:28:17,744
You have a beautiful body.

1468
01:28:17,822 --> 01:28:20,347
I don't know how many times I have
to tell you, you have a beautiful body.

1469
01:28:20,425 --> 01:28:22,222
It's actually very upsetting
when you say that.

1470
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:27,021
Well, look who's here!

1471
01:28:27,365 --> 01:28:30,358
How working class. Love it.

1472
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:32,361
Come in.

1473
01:28:49,055 --> 01:28:54,049
How the fuck am I supposed to do
good medicine on 50 patients a day?

1474
01:28:54,727 --> 01:28:56,058
Plus rounds.

1475
01:28:56,395 --> 01:29:00,059
And phone calls every day with family...
Fucking idiots,

1476
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:04,065
telling you, "No, you're wrong,"
because they looked it up on the Internet.

1477
01:29:06,073 --> 01:29:10,066
I fight over billing,
I fight over prescription coverage.

1478
01:29:11,411 --> 01:29:15,507
The insurance companies
are dedicated to not paying you.

1479
01:29:17,084 --> 01:29:20,076
And the big law firms, man,
they're just waiting.

1480
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:25,414
They're just betting you're going to
make that one big mistake.

1481
01:29:27,427 --> 01:29:31,090
This profession for me,
it was a higher calling.

1482
01:29:31,431 --> 01:29:33,490
You know? Make people's lives better.

1483
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:40,838
And look at me.

1484
01:29:43,944 --> 01:29:45,435
Here they are, for Christ's sake.

1485
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,614
Randall, get up from the floor!
Come with me.

1486
01:29:48,915 --> 01:29:51,407
Come with me. Come on! Come on!

1487
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:52,779
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you all right?

1488
01:29:53,021 --> 01:29:56,047
Go forth, my son. Be fruitful and multiply.

1489
01:29:57,959 --> 01:30:02,293
The thing about the software business
is it's very, very volatile.

1490
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:06,191
You never know where
the financial model's going to go.

1491
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:08,594
It changes every six months.

1492
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:11,071
And you never know
what these hospitals are gonna want.

1493
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:14,200
One day
it's peer-to-peer connectivity,

1494
01:30:14,276 --> 01:30:18,609
then next it's top-down integration
with their preexisting infrastructure.

1495
01:30:21,483 --> 01:30:22,745
You can touch them, if you want.

1496
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:24,746
Oh! Oh.

1497
01:30:25,988 --> 01:30:27,319
Thank you.

1498
01:30:29,492 --> 01:30:30,890
- This way. You'll see.
- No, no, no.

1499
01:30:30,959 --> 01:30:32,824
- I don't think we should do this.
- I have a surprise for you.

1500
01:30:32,895 --> 01:30:35,228
No, no, no. Turn around.
I've got a surprise.

1501
01:30:35,831 --> 01:30:38,061
This is my homegirl, Khae.

1502
01:30:39,235 --> 01:30:40,224
Whoa!

1503
01:30:41,171 --> 01:30:42,831
She's Thai.

1504
01:30:43,338 --> 01:30:44,670
And I'm Thai-curious.

1505
01:30:45,442 --> 01:30:47,376
Engine turning over won't you start?

1506
01:30:49,345 --> 01:30:52,576
This one's come to tear me all apart

1507
01:30:53,349 --> 01:30:55,510
She's Jamie-curious.

1508
01:30:57,887 --> 01:31:00,947
Be still my heart

1509
01:31:01,024 --> 01:31:03,117
- So am I.
- No, no, wait. I don't...

1510
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:06,224
Engine turning over won't you start?

1511
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:09,957
This one's come to tear me all apart

1512
01:31:10,034 --> 01:31:12,126
Be still my heart

1513
01:31:12,202 --> 01:31:14,694
Did I mention that
I just took my company public?

1514
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:16,233
It's a pretty exciting thing

1515
01:31:16,307 --> 01:31:18,467
because you work
on something for so long,

1516
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:21,238
and then
when it comes, it's...

1517
01:31:22,246 --> 01:31:24,476
You know, you see the fruits bear...

1518
01:31:24,548 --> 01:31:29,212
Okay! So, I really have
mixed feelings about this.

1519
01:31:33,224 --> 01:31:35,715
We like Jamie.

1520
01:31:36,026 --> 01:31:39,690
We like Jamie very much.

1521
01:31:40,165 --> 01:31:42,792
Oh. Oh.

1522
01:31:43,368 --> 01:31:44,528
What's wrong?

1523
01:32:03,923 --> 01:32:05,913
Sorry! I'm sorry!

1524
01:32:06,258 --> 01:32:07,919
- Josh!
Be careful.

1525
01:32:08,528 --> 01:32:11,189
- I'm sorry. Stan.
Hey, Pfizie.

1526
01:32:11,263 --> 01:32:12,730
Josh! Ow!

1527
01:32:15,101 --> 01:32:16,089
Josh! Oh!

1528
01:32:16,268 --> 01:32:18,260
Wait! We were just talking!

1529
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:20,764
- Hi.
- Hi. We got to go.

1530
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:21,829
Now?
- Josh!

1531
01:32:22,107 --> 01:32:24,201
- It was a pleasure to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

1532
01:32:24,277 --> 01:32:25,301
We'll keep in touch.

1533
01:32:27,313 --> 01:32:29,213
It feels like a frozen Popsicle.

1534
01:32:29,649 --> 01:32:31,981
Shit. I didn't know that could even happen.

1535
01:32:32,051 --> 01:32:34,918
It's very rare, but it happens.

1536
01:32:34,987 --> 01:32:37,615
- Do you think they'll have to amputate?
- Shut the fuck up, Josh, and drive!

1537
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:38,680
Bad joke.

1538
01:32:39,892 --> 01:32:42,828
Fuck! Sorry. I was looking for the shift!

1539
01:32:43,397 --> 01:32:44,955
- So fucking...
- Sorry.

1540
01:32:45,332 --> 01:32:46,628
You know, for whatever it's worth,

1541
01:32:46,699 --> 01:32:49,328
this has truly been
the best night of my life.

1542
01:32:49,403 --> 01:32:50,427
That's wonderful.

1543
01:32:50,504 --> 01:32:52,164
No, seriously. I'm not even kidding.

1544
01:32:52,405 --> 01:32:53,703
And I have you to thank for it.

1545
01:32:53,774 --> 01:32:56,800
I mean, I never thought I would have
an experience like this ever in my life.

1546
01:32:57,044 --> 01:33:01,344
And this is the incredible thing.
This is why I'm so happy right now.

1547
01:33:01,582 --> 01:33:06,610
Because I fucked that girl.
Oh, my shit, I fucked that girl!

1548
01:33:06,687 --> 01:33:07,677
And I'm thinking to myself,

1549
01:33:07,755 --> 01:33:11,417
"Oh, my God, this is empty!
I feel absolutely nothing at all! "

1550
01:33:11,925 --> 01:33:13,393
- That's great, Josh.
- Yeah.

1551
01:33:13,461 --> 01:33:16,224
All those years I was so jealous of you
for having empty sex,

1552
01:33:16,296 --> 01:33:18,162
and now I was the one
having the empty sex,

1553
01:33:18,233 --> 01:33:21,167
and I realized in that moment
that if I hadn't experienced it,

1554
01:33:21,501 --> 01:33:25,768
I wouldn't have known
how much I didn't want it. You know?

1555
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:30,641
And now I can go back home to Farrah
and feel really good about myself

1556
01:33:30,712 --> 01:33:34,944
for the first time in my entire life.

1557
01:33:35,149 --> 01:33:36,548
And it's all because of you, Jamie.

1558
01:33:36,784 --> 01:33:38,649
It's all because of my big brother Jamie,

1559
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,086
with the enormous cock
that won't go down!

1560
01:33:42,391 --> 01:33:43,790
So thank you, brother!

1561
01:33:44,059 --> 01:33:45,286
Sorry! My bad!

1562
01:33:49,064 --> 01:33:51,896
Plus, my Pfizer stock's up 40%.

1563
01:33:58,641 --> 01:33:59,665
- Hi.
- Hi.

1564
01:33:59,742 --> 01:34:02,404
- Can I help you?
- I'm having a drug reaction.

1565
01:34:02,645 --> 01:34:03,942
What kind of drug reaction?

1566
01:34:07,217 --> 01:34:08,683
Oh. Oh.

1567
01:34:10,686 --> 01:34:12,678
Just take a seat
and we'll be right with you.

1568
01:34:22,265 --> 01:34:23,425
What?

1569
01:34:26,769 --> 01:34:28,101
Chicago.

1570
01:34:29,339 --> 01:34:30,533
I got it.

1571
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:35,668
Dude. Congratulations!
That is unbelievable.

1572
01:34:36,279 --> 01:34:40,443
Jamie, that's everything that
you've wanted. That's incredible, man.

1573
01:34:40,684 --> 01:34:44,518
I'm very proud of you. I'm not surprised,
but I am very proud of you.

1574
01:34:44,788 --> 01:34:46,449
You know who's going to be thrilled,
is Mom and Dad.

1575
01:34:46,690 --> 01:34:50,091
Jamie Randall makes good.
That's incredible, man.

1576
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:52,129
You should be very, very proud of yourself.

1577
01:34:52,196 --> 01:34:53,185
Mmm.

1578
01:34:59,537 --> 01:35:01,835
If you're going to serve beef bourguignon,

1579
01:35:01,906 --> 01:35:03,874
you should at least offer
a proper Burgundy.

1580
01:35:04,208 --> 01:35:06,540
Or a Pinot, for Christ's sake.

1581
01:35:12,718 --> 01:35:13,775
Randall.

1582
01:35:15,052 --> 01:35:16,041
Maggie.

1583
01:35:19,357 --> 01:35:21,348
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Jeremy.

1584
01:35:21,827 --> 01:35:23,488
- Justin.
- Justin! Justin.

1585
01:35:25,896 --> 01:35:27,228
I'll go get the car.

1586
01:35:27,566 --> 01:35:29,727
That would be great, Justin.

1587
01:35:41,981 --> 01:35:43,641
I... I was...

1588
01:35:50,589 --> 01:35:51,989
I tried to call you...

1589
01:35:52,258 --> 01:35:53,816
I'm with someone.

1590
01:35:53,893 --> 01:35:55,655
Yeah, I can see that.

1591
01:36:00,265 --> 01:36:01,426
So...

1592
01:36:03,836 --> 01:36:05,030
How are you?

1593
01:36:06,839 --> 01:36:07,828
I'm good.

1594
01:36:09,108 --> 01:36:10,097
Good.

1595
01:36:12,145 --> 01:36:13,339
Come on.

1596
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,838
I gotta go.

1597
01:36:16,316 --> 01:36:17,510
Maggie?

1598
01:36:23,956 --> 01:36:25,116
It

1599
01:36:27,628 --> 01:36:28,959
was nice to see you.

1600
01:36:34,468 --> 01:36:36,197
You're killing me, Randall.

1601
01:36:37,304 --> 01:36:41,036
- Hey. There he is! You ready to celebrate?
- Hey.

1602
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:42,697
Maggie!

1603
01:36:44,211 --> 01:36:46,237
- Hi, Bruce.
- How are you?

1604
01:36:47,981 --> 01:36:49,209
What are you celebrating?

1605
01:36:49,483 --> 01:36:52,385
This young rock star is about to
take Chicago by storm.

1606
01:36:56,891 --> 01:36:58,017
You got Chicago?

1607
01:37:02,163 --> 01:37:05,098
Congratulations. It was good
to see you, Bruce. I should go.

1608
01:37:05,165 --> 01:37:06,155
Nice to see you, Maggie.

1609
01:37:07,402 --> 01:37:08,494
Peace.

1610
01:37:08,937 --> 01:37:10,029
Uh...

1611
01:37:15,343 --> 01:37:18,278
So, I called it, didn't I call it?
What'd I tell you? Say, "I called it."

1612
01:37:18,346 --> 01:37:19,813
- You should've put money on it.
- I called it.

1613
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:21,110
Where you gonna live?

1614
01:37:21,183 --> 01:37:23,946
Downtown, maybe.
Somewhere far away from my family.

1615
01:37:24,018 --> 01:37:25,280
Downtown?

1616
01:37:25,521 --> 01:37:28,785
You? You want Near North, man.
Pussy!

1617
01:37:29,524 --> 01:37:32,187
And bistros, bars,
pussy, pussy, pussy.

1618
01:37:34,696 --> 01:37:36,858
Why don't I move out near you?
The 'burbs.

1619
01:37:36,966 --> 01:37:38,456
We'll go get a beer every once in a while.

1620
01:37:38,534 --> 01:37:41,196
Nah. You don't want to do that. No.

1621
01:37:41,537 --> 01:37:42,697
Why not?

1622
01:37:50,947 --> 01:37:54,006
I got a big raise, buddy. Big raise.

1623
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:55,882
- You're kidding me.
- Thanks to you!

1624
01:37:56,686 --> 01:37:57,744
Those bastards.

1625
01:37:58,287 --> 01:38:01,621
Buddy, I was never going to get Chicago.
I'm too valuable to them in the field.

1626
01:38:01,725 --> 01:38:02,714
I can't believe this.

1627
01:38:02,792 --> 01:38:05,727
Give me some credit!
It takes a sophisticated eye

1628
01:38:05,829 --> 01:38:08,593
to spot talent in colossal fuck-ups
such as yourself.

1629
01:38:09,499 --> 01:38:11,729
- I don't understand.
- Don't be so naive.

1630
01:38:11,801 --> 01:38:13,063
I didn't actually want to go to Chicago.

1631
01:38:13,136 --> 01:38:14,626
I wanted you to think
I wanted to go to Chicago,

1632
01:38:14,704 --> 01:38:16,069
so you'd want to go to Chicago.

1633
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:17,697
So you'd work your ass off to get there.

1634
01:38:17,774 --> 01:38:19,139
- Oh, Bruce, this is unbelievable.
- Me,

1635
01:38:19,342 --> 01:38:21,811
I love the road! I love a stinky motel!

1636
01:38:22,179 --> 01:38:25,115
I love the barren back roads
and strip malls of the heartland!

1637
01:38:25,349 --> 01:38:26,373
That's what I love.

1638
01:38:26,450 --> 01:38:27,781
Why would I want to live
in my own house?

1639
01:38:27,851 --> 01:38:28,875
That I pay for?

1640
01:38:28,952 --> 01:38:30,420
Why would I want to
watch my kids play Little League?

1641
01:38:30,922 --> 01:38:33,413
Why the fuck would I want to
sleep in the same bed as my wife?

1642
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:35,425
Why the fuck would I wanna do that?

1643
01:39:06,425 --> 01:39:07,517
Okay, so...
Okay, so...

1644
01:39:10,128 --> 01:39:12,596
- What's...
- Talk?

1645
01:39:12,664 --> 01:39:13,858
- Yeah.
- All right.

1646
01:39:14,634 --> 01:39:17,158
- Hi, there. Hi. I'm Maggie Murdock.
- Hello!

1647
01:39:18,670 --> 01:39:22,128
I'm about to have
delicious reprobate sex with...

1648
01:39:23,675 --> 01:39:24,665
What's your name?

1649
01:39:24,744 --> 01:39:25,972
Oh, come on.

1650
01:39:26,045 --> 01:39:29,036
Oh, right, right. Jamie something.

1651
01:39:29,114 --> 01:39:34,017
And we're taping it so that he can
always remember how totally hot I am.

1652
01:39:34,254 --> 01:39:35,448
Was.

1653
01:39:35,521 --> 01:39:37,819
Kids, if you're watching this,

1654
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:40,256
you put it back in Mommy's
secret hiding spot right now

1655
01:39:40,326 --> 01:39:43,193
or you will be sorry.
There will be consequences!

1656
01:39:45,098 --> 01:39:46,429
What else?

1657
01:39:47,233 --> 01:39:48,359
Um...

1658
01:39:51,704 --> 01:39:53,695
Just how happy I am,

1659
01:39:54,875 --> 01:39:56,899
in this moment, right now.

1660
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:01,848
The way the light's
hitting that face of yours.

1661
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:06,745
There's this little breeze
coming in through the window.

1662
01:40:08,388 --> 01:40:13,053
It doesn't matter if I have 10,000
more moments like this, or

1663
01:40:14,995 --> 01:40:17,122
just this one, because

1664
01:40:20,234 --> 01:40:21,724
it's all the same.

1665
01:40:24,272 --> 01:40:26,466
Yeah. Just that.

1666
01:40:28,609 --> 01:40:30,669
Right now, this moment.

1667
01:40:35,684 --> 01:40:37,345
I have this.

1668
01:40:51,032 --> 01:40:52,158
No. Damn it!

1669
01:40:52,934 --> 01:40:54,562
Richard! Richard!

1670
01:40:54,904 --> 01:40:56,427
Where is she?

1671
01:41:28,939 --> 01:41:30,497
Come on! Come on.

1672
01:41:32,508 --> 01:41:33,533
Hey!

1673
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:35,036
Hey!

1674
01:41:41,385 --> 01:41:42,749
Maggie!

1675
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:46,454
Hey! Mag!

1676
01:41:50,527 --> 01:41:51,516
Jamie?

1677
01:41:51,928 --> 01:41:52,917
Pull over.

1678
01:41:53,164 --> 01:41:54,994
No, I can't "pull over"!

1679
01:41:55,332 --> 01:41:56,993
Just for a second! Pull over!

1680
01:42:00,204 --> 01:42:03,640
I need to talk

1681
01:42:03,941 --> 01:42:04,965
to you.

1682
01:42:05,843 --> 01:42:09,040
I don't want to talk to you.

1683
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:27,193
Wait, wait. Okay.

1684
01:42:28,534 --> 01:42:30,797
Open the door. Okay.

1685
01:42:37,976 --> 01:42:39,136
Sorry.

1686
01:42:42,046 --> 01:42:43,742
- I need you.
- Please go away.

1687
01:42:44,116 --> 01:42:46,107
I drove a really long way to say that.

1688
01:42:46,185 --> 01:42:47,345
What? Am I supposed to be impressed?

1689
01:42:47,986 --> 01:42:49,010
I don't know. Yes.

1690
01:42:51,056 --> 01:42:54,025
Look, can you just get off the bus
so we can talk for a second?

1691
01:42:54,259 --> 01:42:56,955
- Just for a second.
- We're on a schedule.

1692
01:42:57,597 --> 01:42:59,257
Five minutes. Please.

1693
01:43:00,399 --> 01:43:02,891
You guys don't mind
if we take five minutes, do you?

1694
01:43:02,969 --> 01:43:04,493
He's handsome.

1695
01:43:05,571 --> 01:43:06,902
- Five minutes.
- He is.

1696
01:43:07,474 --> 01:43:08,634
Five minutes, then I'll let you go.

1697
01:43:19,018 --> 01:43:21,179
I'm full of shit, okay?

1698
01:43:23,423 --> 01:43:27,383
No, I'm knowingly full of shit.

1699
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:31,761
Because...

1700
01:43:32,933 --> 01:43:34,298
Because...

1701
01:43:36,736 --> 01:43:37,897
I have...

1702
01:43:38,405 --> 01:43:43,240
I have never cared about anybody,
or anything, in my entire life.

1703
01:43:43,711 --> 01:43:46,145
And the thing is,
everybody just kind of accepted that.

1704
01:43:46,213 --> 01:43:48,238
Like, "That's just Jamie! "

1705
01:43:51,619 --> 01:43:53,109
And then you...

1706
01:43:56,357 --> 01:43:57,689
Jesus.

1707
01:43:58,392 --> 01:43:59,552
You.

1708
01:44:05,399 --> 01:44:06,559
You.

1709
01:44:11,238 --> 01:44:12,501
You didn't see me that way.

1710
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:18,138
I have never known anyone

1711
01:44:19,814 --> 01:44:23,807
who actually believed that I was enough.

1712
01:44:26,321 --> 01:44:27,619
Until I met you.

1713
01:44:35,664 --> 01:44:38,031
And then you made me believe it, too.

1714
01:44:41,002 --> 01:44:43,972
So, unfortunately,

1715
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,331
I need you.

1716
01:44:48,177 --> 01:44:49,838
And you need me.

1717
01:44:51,781 --> 01:44:52,941
No, I don't.

1718
01:44:53,849 --> 01:44:55,373
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

1719
01:44:55,451 --> 01:44:56,476
Yes, you do.

1720
01:44:56,853 --> 01:44:58,046
Stop it. Stop saying that.

1721
01:44:58,888 --> 01:45:00,879
- You need someone to take care of you.
- No, I don't.

1722
01:45:01,157 --> 01:45:02,750
Everybody does.

1723
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,060
I'm going to need you
more than you need me.

1724
01:45:15,438 --> 01:45:17,703
- That's okay.
- No, it's not!

1725
01:45:18,709 --> 01:45:20,336
It isn't fair.

1726
01:45:22,879 --> 01:45:24,676
I have places to go.

1727
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:26,905
You'll go there.

1728
01:45:28,885 --> 01:45:30,443
I just may have to carry you.

1729
01:45:37,562 --> 01:45:40,428
I can't ask you to do that.

1730
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,560
You didn't.

1731
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:51,300
Hey,

1732
01:45:52,477 --> 01:45:55,139
let's just say in some

1733
01:45:56,181 --> 01:45:59,547
alternate universe,
there's a couple that's just like us, okay?

1734
01:45:59,617 --> 01:46:03,018
Only she's healthy and he's perfect.

1735
01:46:03,755 --> 01:46:07,749
And their world is about how much money
that they're gonna spend on vacation,

1736
01:46:07,826 --> 01:46:10,089
or who's in a bad mood that day,

1737
01:46:10,161 --> 01:46:12,790
or whether they feel guilty
about having a cleaning lady.

1738
01:46:16,268 --> 01:46:17,428
I don't want to be those people.

1739
01:46:19,071 --> 01:46:20,560
I want us.

1740
01:46:23,609 --> 01:46:24,769
You.

1741
01:46:27,012 --> 01:46:28,172
This.

1742
01:46:44,963 --> 01:46:47,694
I used to worry a lot about
who I'd be when I grew up.

1743
01:46:50,302 --> 01:46:53,295
You know,
like how much money I'd make or...

1744
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:56,375
Someday I'd become some big deal.

1745
01:46:59,379 --> 01:47:02,246
Sometimes the thing you most want
doesn't happen.

1746
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:08,214
And sometimes the thing
you never expect to happen, does.

1747
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:13,290
Like giving up my job in Chicago
and everything,

1748
01:47:14,294 --> 01:47:17,822
and deciding to stay
and apply to med school.

1749
01:47:19,332 --> 01:47:20,823
I don't know.

1750
01:47:21,235 --> 01:47:23,396
You meet thousands of people,

1751
01:47:24,405 --> 01:47:26,737
and none of them really touch you.

1752
01:47:29,009 --> 01:47:31,500
And then you meet one person,

1753
01:47:32,513 --> 01:47:36,177
and your life is changed forever.
