00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:15,250
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

3
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,069
My name is Jack Torrance.

4
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,822
His office is the first door
on the left.

5
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:24,823
Thank you.

6
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:39,633
- Mr. Ullman?
- Yes.

7
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:44,175
- I'm Jack Torrance.
- Oh! Well, come on in, Jack.

8
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,766
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.

9
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,934
- This is my secretary, Susie.
- Hello.

10
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,395
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?

11
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:54,750
Oh, no problem at all.
I made the trip in 3½ hours.

12
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,650
Ah, that's very good time.

13
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:58,486
Please sit down a minute, Jack.

14
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,446
Just make yourself at home.

15
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:01,947
Would you like some coffee?

16
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:04,617
Oh, if you're gonna have some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

17
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:05,686
- Susie.
- Sure.

18
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,787
Oh, and would you ask
Bill Watson to join us?

19
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:12,788
Yes, I will.

20
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:22,093
Mom?

21
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,636
Yeah?

22
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:27,890
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

23
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:29,663
Sure, I do.

24
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:33,366
It'll be lots of fun.

25
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:35,564
Yeah. I guess so.

26
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:40,663
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

27
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:45,529
Yeah, I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

28
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:48,702
Yeah, I guess so.

29
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:49,954
What about Tony?

30
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:52,873
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

31
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:55,668
<i>No, it ain't, Mrs. Torrance.</i>

32
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:58,504
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

33
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:00,965
<i>I don't want to
go there, Mrs. Torrance.</i>

34
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:03,217
Well, how come
you don't want to go?

35
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:05,761
<i>I just don't.</i>

36
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:08,597
Well, let's just wait and see.

37
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:10,980
We're all going to have
a real good time.

38
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:15,447
Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

39
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:17,025
- How do you do?
- Bill, how do you do?

40
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,259
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

41
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:21,277
Grab a Chair, Bill. Join in.

42
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:25,656
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook (Hotel) for us this winter.

43
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:28,742
I'd like you to take him around
the place as soon as we're through.

44
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:30,369
Fine.

45
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,079
Jack is a schoolteacher.

46
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,707
Uh, formerly a schoolteacher.

47
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,625
<font color="#878787">BILL</font>:
<i>What line of work are you in now?</i>

48
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:38,461
I'm a writer.

49
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:42,298
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

50
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,467
Well, this ought to be
quite a change for you.

51
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:47,219
Well, I'm looking for a change.

52
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,015
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly and for once...

53
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:53,225
I agree with them.

54
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:55,359
Let's see, where were we?
Uh...

55
00:05:55,384 --> 00:05:58,063
Yeah, I was about to explain that...

56
00:05:58,064 --> 00:06:02,443
our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

57
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:06,113
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

58
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:09,116
Do you mind if I ask
why you do that?

59
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:12,786
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

60
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:15,443
Oh, sure it would be.
The problem is the enormous cost

61
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:18,792
it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

62
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:20,753
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

63
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:23,297
It gets an average of
20 feet of snow during the winter.

64
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:26,563
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible

65
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:28,886
to keep it clear.

66
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:31,430
When the place was built in 1907,

67
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:34,225
there was very little interest
in winter sports.

68
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:39,226
And this site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

69
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:42,066
Well, it's certainly got plenty of that.

70
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,943
That's right.

71
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:47,145
Did they give you any idea
in Denver about...

72
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,864
what the job entails?

73
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:51,784
Only in a very general way.

74
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,619
Well...

75
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,247
the winters can be fantastically cruel.

76
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:59,917
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

77
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,127
and depreciation
which can occur.

78
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:04,755
And this consists mainly
of running the boiler,

79
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:08,926
heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis,

80
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:11,145
repairing damage as it occurs...

81
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,989
and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

82
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:18,433
Well, that sounds fine to me.

83
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,522
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

84
00:07:21,523 --> 00:07:24,421
The only thing that can get a bit trying
up here during the winter...

85
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:28,654
is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

86
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:33,576
Well, that just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

87
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:37,231
I'm outlining a new writing project
and...

88
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:41,166
five months of peace
is just what I want.

89
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,210
That's very good, Jack.

90
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:46,589
Because, for some people...

91
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,549
solitude and...

92
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,342
isolation...

93
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:54,138
can, of itself, become a problem.

94
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,265
Not for me.

95
00:07:56,266 --> 00:08:01,266
How about your wife and son?
How do you think they'll take to it?

96
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:02,804
They'll love it.

97
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:04,095
<i>Great.</i>

98
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:10,195
Well, before I turn you over to Bill...

99
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:13,907
there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

100
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:15,534
I don't want to sound melodramatic,

101
00:08:15,535 --> 00:08:18,329
but it's something that's been
known to give a few people

102
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,206
second thoughts about the job.

103
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:23,191
I'm intrigued.

104
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:25,793
I don't suppose they
told you anything in Denver

105
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:30,215
about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970...

106
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:33,135
I don't believe they did.

107
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:35,137
<i>Well...</i>

108
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:37,389
<i>My predecessor in this job...</i>

109
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,643
hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

110
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:44,396
He came up here with his wife and
two little girls of about 8 and 10.

111
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:47,697
And he had a good employment record,
good references...

112
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:50,198
And from what I've been told
by many, he seemed like a...

113
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:53,034
completely normal individual.

114
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:55,532
But at some point, during the winter,

115
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:59,618
he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

116
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:05,236
He ran amok and...

117
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:07,456
killed his family with an axe.

118
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:14,027
<i>Stacked them neatly in one of the rooms
in the west wing and then he...</i>

119
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:17,612
<i>he put both barrels
of his Shotgun in his mouth.</i>

120
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:22,439
The police...
they thought that it was

121
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:25,314
what the old-timers
used to call "Cabin Fever"...

122
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:28,261
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur

123
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:32,567
when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

124
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:35,903
Wow.

125
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,326
That is...

126
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,965
quite a story!

127
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:44,748
Yeah, it is.

128
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:48,377
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

129
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:50,295
But, it did.

130
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:51,839
And uh...

131
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,427
I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

132
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:59,430
I certainly can and...

133
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,182
I also understand
why your people in Denver

134
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:04,198
left it for you to tell me.

135
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:08,292
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

136
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,577
by the idea of staying alone
at a place where...

137
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:12,860
<i>something like that
actually happened.</i>

138
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:17,861
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman
that's not gonna happen with me.

139
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:21,827
And... as far as my wife
is concerned,

140
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:25,873
I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her about it.

141
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:30,976
She's a confirmed ghost story
and horror film addict.

142
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:41,176
Tony, do you think Dad'll get the job?

143
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:43,932
<i>He already did.</i>

144
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:48,933
<i>He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.</i>

145
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:02,367
Hello.

146
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:05,245
- Hi, babe.
<i>- Hi, hon. How's it going?</i>

147
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:09,041
Great. Look, I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to go through.

148
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:12,377
I don't think I can get home
before 9:00 or 10:00.

149
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:14,087
Sounds like you got the job.

150
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:17,007
Right. It's a beautiful place.

151
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:20,594
You and Danny are gonna love it.

152
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:23,764
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

153
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:26,558
<i>I don't know.</i>

154
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,687
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

155
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:33,440
<i>I don't want to.</i>

156
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:35,943
Please.

157
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:37,402
<i>No.</i>

158
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:42,403
Now, Tony, tell me.

159
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:14,394
<i>Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.</i>

160
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:20,353
That's good.
Now the other one.

161
00:12:20,378 --> 00:12:21,425
Good boy.

162
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:30,873
Now, Danny...

163
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:33,125
when you were brushing
your teeth...

164
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:36,295
do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

165
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:41,296
or saw any bright, flashing lights
or anything at all strange?

166
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:46,138
No.

167
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,224
<i>Do you remember when
you were brushing your teeth?</i>

168
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:51,643
Yes.

169
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:56,644
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

170
00:12:59,485 --> 00:13:04,364
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up".

171
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:08,785
Now, Danny, can you remember
what you were doing...

172
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:13,786
just before you started
brushing your teeth?

173
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,668
Talking to Tony.

174
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:19,880
Is Tony one of your animals?

175
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:23,133
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

176
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:25,928
Tony's his imaginary friend.

177
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,007
<i>Oh.</i>

178
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,691
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

179
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:33,887
No.

180
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:35,707
Why not?

181
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:38,770
Because he hides.

182
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:40,996
Where does he go?

183
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:43,902
To my stomach.

184
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:49,098
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

185
00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:56,870
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

186
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:58,651
Okay.

187
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:00,846
That's fine.

188
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:03,463
All right, Danny.

189
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:06,301
I'm gonna ask you
to do me a favor...

190
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:09,888
and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

191
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,223
Do I have to?

192
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:13,684
Yes. I'd like you to.

193
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:16,645
We're just gonna go in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

194
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:19,285
I'll come back and check on you.
Okay?

195
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,864
- Okay.
- Bye.

196
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,481
- Shall we go into the living room?
- Yes.

197
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,060
- Please.
- Thank you.

198
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:43,714
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

199
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:48,427
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

200
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:50,387
Yeah?

201
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,472
Oh.

202
00:14:52,473 --> 00:14:55,809
Yeah, he seems absolutely fine now.

203
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,477
But you should've seen him.

204
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:58,729
I know.

205
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,605
Kids can scare you to death.

206
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:03,692
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

207
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:06,778
And they look much worse
than they are.

208
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,803
But what was the matter with him?

209
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:11,249
Mrs. Torrance,
most of the time,

210
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:14,100
these episodes with kids
are never explained.

211
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:18,953
They're brought on by emotional
factors and they rarely occur again.

212
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:22,975
They're more akin
to auto-hypnosis...

213
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,964
a kind of self-induced trance.

214
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:28,842
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

215
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:32,429
we can always think about
having some tests done.

216
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,556
No, thank you.

217
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:38,609
Oh, I'm sure you're right.

218
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:40,837
Have you been in Boulder long,
Mrs. Torrance?

219
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:43,482
Only about three months.

220
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:46,858
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

221
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:53,184
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend...

222
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:54,215
Tony.

223
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,318
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

224
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,376
No, um...

225
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:02,521
Let's see...

226
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,326
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony

227
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:08,162
about the time we put him
in nursery school.

228
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:12,021
Did he adjust well to school?

229
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:13,692
No.

230
00:16:13,717 --> 00:16:15,887
He didn't like it too much at first...

231
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:19,726
and then he had an injury,
so, we kept him out for a while and...

232
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:22,023
Yeah, I guess that's
about the time

233
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,383
when I first noticed that
he was talking to Tony.

234
00:16:25,523 --> 00:16:27,422
What sort of injury did he have?

235
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:30,211
He dislocated his shoulder.

236
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:32,984
How did he manage to do that?

237
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,170
It was just one of
those things, you know...

238
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:41,930
Purely an accident.

239
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:46,733
My husband had
been drinking and...

240
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:49,631
he came home
about three hours late.

241
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:54,632
So, he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

242
00:16:54,929 --> 00:17:00,130
And, well, Danny had scattered some of
his school papers all over the room

243
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:04,599
and my husband grabbed his arm,
you know, to pull him away from them.

244
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,536
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child, you know...

245
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,279
in a park or in the street...

246
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:13,850
But, on this particular occasion...

247
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,661
my husband just used
too much strength...

248
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:19,725
and he injured Danny's arm.

249
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:26,918
Anyway, something good did come
out of it all because he said,

250
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:29,801
"Wendy, I'm never gonna
touch another drop...

251
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:31,950
And if I do, you can leave me".

252
00:17:31,975 --> 00:17:33,341
And he didn't.

253
00:17:33,342 --> 00:17:38,342
And... he hasn't had
any alcohol in 5 months.

254
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:04,789
Boy...

255
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,790
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

256
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:11,280
Mm-hm.

257
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:15,733
Dad?

258
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:17,538
Yes?

259
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:19,921
I'm hungry.

260
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:24,725
Well, you should've
eaten your breakfast.

261
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:28,918
We'll get you something as soon
as we get to the hotel. Okay?

262
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:30,100
Okay, mom.

263
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:36,901
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

264
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:41,284
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

265
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:42,744
Oh.

266
00:18:42,745 --> 00:18:47,123
What was the Donner party?

267
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:51,628
They were a party of settlers
in covered-wagon times.

268
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:55,090
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

269
00:18:55,091 --> 00:19:00,091
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

270
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:03,515
You mean they ate each other up?

271
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:06,851
They had to...
in order to survive.

272
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:08,270
Jack!

273
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:09,562
Don't worry, Mom.

274
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:14,109
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

275
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,945
See, it's okay.

276
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:21,946
He saw it on the television.

277
00:19:50,062 --> 00:19:52,105
- What time does the plane leave?
- 8:30.

278
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:55,066
Well, that still gives us plenty of time
to go over everything first.

279
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,235
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.

280
00:19:57,236 --> 00:20:00,572
Good morning, Jack. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

281
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:03,408
No problem. In fact, we had time
to grab a bite to eat.

282
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,494
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

283
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:08,413
- Hi.
- Is your family having a look around?

284
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:12,000
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

285
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:14,294
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.

286
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:15,820
Oh, fine.

287
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:18,117
Well, in view of all the ground
we have to cover today,

288
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:19,290
I suggest we go and
have a quick look

289
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:21,851
at your apartment and
get started straight away.

290
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:24,421
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment?

291
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:26,765
- Fine.
- I'd better collect my family first.

292
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:27,782
Oh, yes.

293
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:38,109
This is our Colorado Lounge.

294
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,945
Oh, it's beautiful !

295
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:42,989
My God !

296
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,784
This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon?

297
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:47,285
It sure is.

298
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:51,748
I've never seen anything
like this before.

299
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:53,917
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?

300
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:55,689
Yeah, I believe they're based...

301
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,963
mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

302
00:20:58,964 --> 00:21:01,132
They're really gorgeous.

303
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,517
As a matter of fact,
this is probably

304
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:05,845
 the most gorgeous hotel
I've ever seen.

305
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:09,131
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

306
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:12,467
In its heyday, it was one of
the stopping place for the jet setters...

307
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:15,647
even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

308
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:18,817
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

309
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:20,318
Lots of movie stars.

310
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,237
Royalty?

311
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:27,238
All the best people.

312
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,295
This is the staff wing of the hotel.

313
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:23,882
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

314
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:27,010
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.

315
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,387
<i>And... here are your quarters.</i>

316
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:32,223
Living room, bedroom, bathroom

317
00:22:32,224 --> 00:22:37,224
and a small bedroom for your son.

318
00:22:38,314 --> 00:22:40,231
Perfect for a child.

319
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:45,232
- Yeah.
- Yes.

320
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:51,242
<i>Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.</i>

321
00:22:51,243 --> 00:22:55,580
<i>Easy to keep.</i>

322
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:56,831
Cozy.

323
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:59,474
<i>Yes, very cozy for a family.</i>

324
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:01,317
<i>And if you feel like spreading out...</i>

325
00:23:01,342 --> 00:23:04,006
<i>you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.</i>

326
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:08,551
Well, it's very...

327
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:10,239
homey.

328
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,764
Yeah.

329
00:23:12,765 --> 00:23:15,225
This is our famous hedge maze.

330
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:19,729
It's quite an attraction around here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

331
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,232
and the hedge is about
as old as the hotel itself.

332
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:25,068
It's a lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there

333
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:27,710
unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

334
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:31,702
When was the Overlook (Hotel) built?

335
00:23:31,727 --> 00:23:34,994
Uh... construction started in 1907.

336
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:37,310
It was finished in 1909.

337
00:23:37,335 --> 00:23:40,209
The site is supposed to be located
on an Indian burial ground...

338
00:23:40,234 --> 00:23:41,857
and I believe,
they actually had to

339
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:44,328
repel a few Indian attacks
as they were building it.

340
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:47,966
That's our Snowcat.

341
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:49,467
Can you both drive a car?

342
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:50,635
- Yes.
- Yes.

343
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:54,556
That's fine, because basically
the Snowcat operates very much like a car

344
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:56,440
and it won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

345
00:23:58,268 --> 00:24:01,861
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago

346
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:04,431
just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

347
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:07,151
Oh! Well, he sure
did a beautiful job.

348
00:24:07,152 --> 00:24:08,893
Pink and gold are
my favorite colors.

349
00:24:08,918 --> 00:24:12,293
Ah!
Well, this is our Gold Ballroom.

350
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:15,702
Oh, I'll say!

351
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:19,998
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

352
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:23,231
Boy, I bet you, we could really have
a good party in this room, huh, hon?

353
00:24:23,256 --> 00:24:25,182
Un... I'm afraid you're
not gonna do too well here

354
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:27,088
unless you brought
your own supplies.

355
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:30,563
We always remove all the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

356
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:33,595
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

357
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:34,804
We don't drink.

358
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:36,431
Well, then you're in luck.

359
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:40,760
Oh, Dick, come on over and
say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

360
00:24:40,785 --> 00:24:43,187
-Sure.
- This is Dick Hallorann, our head chef.

361
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:46,282
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

362
00:24:46,307 --> 00:24:47,742
- Glad to meet you, Winifred.
- Nice to meet you.

363
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:50,708
The Torrances are gonna take care
of the Overlook for us this winter.

364
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:54,652
Oh, that's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

365
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:56,738
Oh, it's just wonderful.

366
00:24:56,739 --> 00:24:59,490
Hi, Danny!

367
00:24:59,491 --> 00:25:02,118
I found him outside looking for you.

368
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,955
Dan, did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

369
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:07,331
Yeah.

370
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:08,666
Come on over here.

371
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,418
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Susie.

372
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:12,050
Dick, if you're ready
to do it now,

373
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:14,792
I think it'd be good idea to show
Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

374
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,674
while I continue on with Jack.

375
00:25:16,675 --> 00:25:19,343
It would be a pleasure.
Right this way Mrs. Torrance.

376
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:21,095
Great. See you later, hon.

377
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:24,849
Bye, darling.

378
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,352
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

379
00:25:28,353 --> 00:25:31,105
Now, are you a "Winnie,"
or a "Freddie"?

380
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:32,273
I'm a Wendy.

381
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:35,985
Oh, Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

382
00:25:35,986 --> 00:25:37,820
God... This is the kitchen, huh?

383
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:39,614
Yeah, this is it.

384
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:42,241
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

385
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:45,828
Yeah. It's the biggest place
I've ever seen.

386
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:48,372
Yeah, this whole place
is such an enormous maze.

387
00:25:48,373 --> 00:25:52,835
I feel like I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

388
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:54,879
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance.

389
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,590
It's big, but it still ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

390
00:25:57,591 --> 00:26:00,009
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

391
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,428
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

392
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:05,765
Well, one thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food...

393
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:08,708
because you folks could eat up here
a whole year

394
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,645
and never have
the same menu twice.

395
00:26:10,646 --> 00:26:14,899
Now... right here,
is our walk-in freezer.

396
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,152
Now, this is where we keep
all of our meat.

397
00:26:18,153 --> 00:26:20,363
You got 15 rib roasts...

398
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:22,698
30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

399
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:25,952
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

400
00:26:25,953 --> 00:26:29,247
50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

401
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,416
and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

402
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,252
- No.
- You don't?

403
00:26:34,253 --> 00:26:36,045
Well, what's your
favorite food, then?

404
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:38,631
French fries and ketchup.

405
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:40,842
Well, I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

406
00:26:40,843 --> 00:26:45,843
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

407
00:26:46,265 --> 00:26:49,308
Mr. Hallorann...

408
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,102
how'd you know we call him Doc?

409
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:52,144
Beg your pardon?

410
00:26:52,168 --> 00:26:55,460
Doc. You called Danny
"Doc" twice, just now.

411
00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:57,525
- I did?
- Yeah.

412
00:26:57,526 --> 00:27:00,862
We call him Doc sometimes, you know,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

413
00:27:00,863 --> 00:27:02,321
But how did you know that?

414
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:05,074
Well, I guess, I probably
heard you call him that.

415
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:07,535
Well, it's possible.
But I honestly don't remember

416
00:27:07,536 --> 00:27:09,954
calling him that
since we've been with you.

417
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:12,331
Well, anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

418
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:16,836
Eh, what's up, Doc?

419
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:20,798
Now, this is the storeroom.

420
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,947
In here, Mrs. Torrance,
is where we keep

421
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:25,803
all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

422
00:27:25,804 --> 00:27:28,472
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

423
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:32,476
canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

424
00:27:32,477 --> 00:27:35,855
Post toasties, corn flakes,
sugar puffs...

425
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:40,151
rice krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and cream of wheat.

426
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:42,778
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

427
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,474
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

428
00:27:53,624 --> 00:27:56,200
<i>How'd you like
some ice cream, Doc?</i>

429
00:27:58,638 --> 00:28:00,671
<i>Sociables, finger rolls...</i>

430
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:02,423
and 7 kinds of what have you.

431
00:28:02,424 --> 00:28:06,177
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

432
00:28:06,178 --> 00:28:09,472
dried raisins and dried prunes.

433
00:28:09,497 --> 00:28:13,090
You know, Mrs. Torrance, you gotta
keep regular if you want to be happy.

434
00:28:15,312 --> 00:28:16,687
- Hi
- Hi.

435
00:28:16,688 --> 00:28:18,522
- How're you getting on?
- Just fine.

436
00:28:18,523 --> 00:28:20,818
Dick, can we borrow
Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?

437
00:28:20,843 --> 00:28:22,412
We're on our way
through to the basement.

438
00:28:22,437 --> 00:28:24,403
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

439
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:27,823
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

440
00:28:27,824 --> 00:28:30,534
- You like ice cream, Doc?
- Yeah.

441
00:28:30,535 --> 00:28:31,702
I thought you did.

442
00:28:31,703 --> 00:28:34,997
You folks don't mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we're waiting for you?

443
00:28:34,998 --> 00:28:37,041
- Not at all.
- No, we don't mind.

444
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,876
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?

445
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:43,877
- Yeah.
- Okay, you behave yourself.

446
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:46,550
Well, what kind of ice cream
do you like, Doc?

447
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:47,760
Chocolate.

448
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:50,565
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

449
00:28:55,227 --> 00:28:57,395
It's amazing how much activity
is going on today.

450
00:28:57,396 --> 00:29:00,398
Yes, well, the guests and some of
the staff left yesterday, but the...

451
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,066
last day's always very hectic.

452
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:05,319
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

453
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,573
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

454
00:29:09,574 --> 00:29:12,394
- Just like a ghost ship, huh?
- Yes.

455
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:22,290
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

456
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:31,842
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

457
00:29:36,226 --> 00:29:40,104
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

458
00:29:40,105 --> 00:29:42,857
my grandmother and I
could hold conversations

459
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:47,778
entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

460
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:51,574
She called it "Shining".

461
00:29:51,575 --> 00:29:54,493
And for a long time, I thought
it was just the two of us

462
00:29:54,494 --> 00:29:57,747
that had "The Shine" to us.

463
00:29:57,748 --> 00:30:01,417
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

464
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,461
But there are other folks...

465
00:30:03,462 --> 00:30:08,462
though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

466
00:30:11,887 --> 00:30:16,887
How long have you
been able to do it?

467
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,519
Why don't you want to talk about it?

468
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:30,821
I'm not supposed to.

469
00:30:30,822 --> 00:30:35,822
Who says you ain't supposed to?

470
00:30:36,787 --> 00:30:40,164
Tony.

471
00:30:40,165 --> 00:30:44,293
Who's Tony?

472
00:30:44,294 --> 00:30:49,294
Tony is the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

473
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:51,842
Is Tony the one that...

474
00:30:51,843 --> 00:30:54,970
tells you things?

475
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:57,973
Yes.

476
00:30:57,974 --> 00:31:02,186
How does he tell you things?

477
00:31:02,187 --> 00:31:06,690
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

478
00:31:06,691 --> 00:31:11,691
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

479
00:31:12,614 --> 00:31:17,576
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

480
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:19,620
Yes.

481
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:23,040
Do they know he tells you things?

482
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:28,041
No, Tony told me
never to tell them.

483
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,715
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

484
00:31:31,716 --> 00:31:36,716
About the Overlook Hotel?

485
00:31:37,556 --> 00:31:40,015
I don't know.

486
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:42,560
Now think real hard, Doc.

487
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:43,607
Think.

488
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:50,818
Maybe he showed me something.

489
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:55,819
Try to think of what it was.

490
00:31:56,449 --> 00:32:01,245
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?

491
00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:02,872
No.

492
00:32:02,873 --> 00:32:05,583
Scared of nothing here.

493
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:07,793
It's just that...

494
00:32:07,794 --> 00:32:11,463
you know, some places
are like people.

495
00:32:11,464 --> 00:32:13,382
Some shine...

496
00:32:13,383 --> 00:32:14,729
Some don't.

497
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:18,345
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel here

498
00:32:18,346 --> 00:32:23,346
has something about it
that's like shining.

499
00:32:24,686 --> 00:32:29,686
Is there something bad here?

500
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:38,699
Well...

501
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,327
you know, Doc,
when something happens...

502
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:45,748
it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

503
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:47,499
Say, like...

504
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,295
if someone burns toast.

505
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:52,671
Well...

506
00:32:52,672 --> 00:32:57,672
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind...

507
00:32:58,511 --> 00:33:02,139
Not things that anyone can notice...

508
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:07,140
But things that people
who "Shine" can see.

509
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:11,690
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

510
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:13,651
well...

511
00:33:13,652 --> 00:33:18,652
sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

512
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:22,409
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

513
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:26,664
in this particular hotel
over the years.

514
00:33:26,665 --> 00:33:31,665
And not all of them was good.

515
00:33:32,337 --> 00:33:35,352
What about Room 237?

516
00:33:38,343 --> 00:33:41,845
Room 237?

517
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:46,684
You're scared of Room 237,
ain't you?

518
00:33:46,685 --> 00:33:49,687
No, I ain't.

519
00:33:49,688 --> 00:33:54,688
Mr. Hallorann,
what is in Room 237?

520
00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:56,652
Nothing.

521
00:33:56,653 --> 00:34:00,072
There ain't nothing in room 237.

522
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:03,534
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

523
00:34:03,535 --> 00:34:05,869
So, stay out.

524
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:10,870
You understand?
Stay out!

525
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:51,642
Good morning, hon.

526
00:35:51,643 --> 00:35:54,144
Your breakfast is ready.

527
00:35:54,145 --> 00:35:55,979
What time is it?

528
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,315
It's about 11:30.

529
00:35:58,316 --> 00:36:02,319
Eleven-thirty, Jesus.

530
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,030
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

531
00:36:05,031 --> 00:36:07,783
I know it.

532
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:10,953
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

533
00:36:10,954 --> 00:36:14,790
Nice.

534
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:16,792
It's really pretty outside.

535
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:20,629
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

536
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,630
Oh, I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

537
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:29,054
Any ideas yet?

538
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:30,931
Lots of ideas.

539
00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:32,933
No good ones.

540
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:35,894
Well, something will come.

541
00:36:35,895 --> 00:36:40,441
It's just a matter of settling back
into the habit of writing every day.

542
00:36:40,442 --> 00:36:45,195
Yep. That's all it is.

543
00:36:45,196 --> 00:36:47,906
It's really nice up here, isn't it?

544
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:49,867
I love it.

545
00:36:49,868 --> 00:36:52,369
I really do.

546
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,581
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.

547
00:36:55,582 --> 00:36:59,543
Yeah, it's amazing how fast
you get used to such a big place.

548
00:36:59,544 --> 00:37:02,671
I tell you, when we first
came up here...

549
00:37:02,672 --> 00:37:05,174
I thought it was kind of scary.

550
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:08,385
I fell in love with it right away.

551
00:37:08,386 --> 00:37:11,555
When I came up here
for my interview...

552
00:37:11,556 --> 00:37:15,601
it was as though
I'd been here before.

553
00:37:15,602 --> 00:37:18,437
I mean, we all have
moments of déjâ vu...

554
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:21,398
but this was ridiculous.

555
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:23,442
It was almost as though I knew...

556
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:27,070
what was going to be
around every corner.

557
00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:31,158
Ooh-woo-ooh.

558
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:03,732
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?

559
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:06,485
- All right.
- And you're gonna lose.

560
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:09,780
- And I'm gonna get you.
- You better run fast!

561
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:15,953
Look out!

562
00:38:15,954 --> 00:38:18,038
I'm coming in close.

563
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,950
<i>Loser has to keep America clean.</i>

564
00:38:19,975 --> 00:38:22,200
<i>- Oh, no!
- Keep America clean.</i>

565
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:25,212
Okay. Danny, you win.

566
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:27,714
Let's take the rest
of this walking, huh?

567
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:30,092
- Okay.
- Whew.

568
00:38:30,093 --> 00:38:34,137
Give me your hand.

569
00:38:34,138 --> 00:38:36,139
Isn't it beautiful?

570
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,171
Yeah.

571
00:38:53,658 --> 00:38:58,658
Dead end.

572
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:54,635
Woo! we made it.

573
00:39:54,636 --> 00:39:59,636
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.

574
00:40:17,575 --> 00:40:19,743
It's so pretty.

575
00:40:19,744 --> 00:40:20,790
Yeah.

576
00:40:23,956 --> 00:40:26,875
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?

577
00:40:26,876 --> 00:40:27,938
Nope.

578
00:40:38,221 --> 00:40:39,908
<i>Rutherford was serving a life sentence...</i>

579
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:42,766
<i>for his conviction in a 1968 shooting.</i>

580
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:45,125
<i>And the search continues
in the mountains near UAE today </i>

581
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,853
<i>for that missing Aspen woman.</i>

582
00:40:46,854 --> 00:40:50,440
<i>24 year old Susan Robertson
has been missing 10 days.</i>

583
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:53,360
<i>She disappeared while on
a hunting trip with her husband.</i>

584
00:40:53,361 --> 00:40:55,259
<i>They have good weather right now,
but they may have to</i>

585
00:40:55,284 --> 00:40:58,728
<i>call off the search if a predicted
snowstorm moves in tomorrow.</i>

586
00:40:58,753 --> 00:41:01,159
<i>Sunny, it's so beautiful
here in Denver today...</i>

587
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,495
<i>it's hard to believe
a snowstorm could be that close.</i>

588
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:05,956
I know. I wanna go outside
and lie in the sun...

589
00:41:05,957 --> 00:41:10,066
<i>yet to our north, to our west,
it is snowing and cold.</i>

590
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:11,670
<i>And it's moving...</i>

591
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:15,347
<i>right here towards Colorado,
right now as we talk. It's incredible.</i>

592
00:43:43,447 --> 00:43:44,470
Hi, hon.

593
00:43:48,494 --> 00:43:52,455
How's it going?

594
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:53,495
Fine.

595
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,307
Get a lot written today?

596
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,659
Yes.

597
00:44:03,175 --> 00:44:06,838
Hey, the weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

598
00:44:12,143 --> 00:44:14,213
What do you want me
to do about it?

599
00:44:16,647 --> 00:44:19,149
Oh, come on, hon.

600
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,893
Don't be so grouchy.

601
00:44:21,569 --> 00:44:23,278
I'm not...

602
00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:24,654
being grouchy.

603
00:44:24,655 --> 00:44:27,221
I just want to finish my work.

604
00:44:30,995 --> 00:44:33,622
Okay. I understand.

605
00:44:33,623 --> 00:44:36,416
I'll come back later on with
a couple of sandwiches for you and...

606
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:38,604
Maybe you'll let me
read something then...

607
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:43,381
Wendy...

608
00:44:43,382 --> 00:44:46,885
let me explain something to you.

609
00:44:46,886 --> 00:44:50,972
Whenever you come in here and interrupt me,
you're breaking my concentration.

610
00:44:50,973 --> 00:44:52,457
You're distracting me...

611
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:56,227
and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

612
00:44:56,228 --> 00:44:59,481
Understand?

613
00:44:59,482 --> 00:45:01,149
Yeah.

614
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,485
Fine.

615
00:45:03,486 --> 00:45:05,403
We're gonna make a new rule:

616
00:45:05,404 --> 00:45:07,030
Whenever I'm in here...

617
00:45:07,031 --> 00:45:08,664
and you hear me typing...

618
00:45:11,094 --> 00:45:12,391
Whether you don't hear
me typing or

619
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:14,264
whatever the fuck you hear
me doing in here...

620
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:16,748
when I'm in here,
that means that I am working.

621
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:19,209
That means don't come in.

622
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:24,130
Now, do you think
you can handle that?

623
00:45:24,131 --> 00:45:26,091
Yeah.

624
00:45:26,092 --> 00:45:28,259
Fine.

625
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,845
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

626
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:36,322
Okay.

627
00:46:07,508 --> 00:46:08,554
All right, you!

628
00:46:10,302 --> 00:46:11,609
I know you've got more.

629
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:15,593
Missed!

630
00:46:20,855 --> 00:46:21,898
Don't have!

631
00:46:21,923 --> 00:46:23,492
No fair anymore.

632
00:47:20,664 --> 00:47:21,671
Oh, no.

633
00:47:31,342 --> 00:47:32,638
I knew it.

634
00:48:02,873 --> 00:48:07,873
This is KDK-12 Calling KDK-1.

635
00:48:08,879 --> 00:48:12,799
<i>KDK-12 to KDK-1.</i>

636
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,302
This is KDK-1.
We're receiving you. Over.

637
00:48:16,303 --> 00:48:19,349
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

638
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,982
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

639
00:48:23,007 --> 00:48:24,602
Oh, we're just fine.

640
00:48:24,603 --> 00:48:27,272
But our telephones don't seem
to be doing too well.

641
00:48:27,273 --> 00:48:30,942
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

642
00:48:30,943 --> 00:48:35,071
Yes, quite a few of them are down,
due to the storm. Over.

643
00:48:35,072 --> 00:48:38,449
<i>Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.</i>

644
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:39,826
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

645
00:48:39,827 --> 00:48:43,746
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

646
00:48:43,747 --> 00:48:47,625
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

647
00:48:47,626 --> 00:48:50,994
Oh, yes. It's one of the worst
we've had for years.

648
00:48:51,019 --> 00:48:53,713
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance? Over.

649
00:48:54,758 --> 00:48:57,552
I suppose not. Over.

650
00:48:57,553 --> 00:49:00,509
Well, if you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

651
00:49:00,978 --> 00:49:02,384
And, Mrs. Torrance?

652
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:07,580
<i>I think it might be a good idea if you
leave your radio ON all the time now. Over.</i>

653
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:09,272
Okay. We'll do that.

654
00:49:09,273 --> 00:49:11,566
It was real nice talking to you.

655
00:49:11,567 --> 00:49:16,567
Bye. Over and out.

656
00:49:49,104 --> 00:49:54,104
Hello, Danny.

657
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:01,570
Come and play with us.

658
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:08,498
Come and play with us, Danny.

659
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:12,126
Forever...

660
00:50:12,127 --> 00:50:14,837
and ever...

661
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:16,314
and ever.

662
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:50,957
Tony...

663
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:55,958
I'm scared.

664
00:50:58,465 --> 00:51:03,465
<i>Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.</i>

665
00:51:03,637 --> 00:51:07,724
<i>It's just like pictures
in a book, Danny.</i>

666
00:51:07,725 --> 00:51:12,725
<i>It isn't real.</i>

667
00:51:21,363 --> 00:51:23,406
<i>Please let me give you some money.</i>

668
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:25,658
<i>I wouldn 't think of it.</i>

669
00:51:25,659 --> 00:51:27,910
<i>Well, how can I repay you?</i>

670
00:51:27,911 --> 00:51:30,413
<i>It's okay. Really.</i>

671
00:51:30,414 --> 00:51:32,749
<i>Well, I'm going to have some coffee.</i>

672
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,002
<i>Would you like some?</i>

673
00:51:36,003 --> 00:51:37,253
<i>Sure.</i>

674
00:51:37,254 --> 00:51:42,254
<i>Great. Sit down.</i>

675
00:51:48,066 --> 00:51:51,504
<i>Ooh, marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.</i>

676
00:51:53,312 --> 00:51:57,607
<i>- Coffee will be ready...</i>
<font color="#878787">DANNY</font>: Mom.

677
00:51:57,608 --> 00:51:59,525
<font color="#878787">WENDY</font>: Yeah.
- <i>Oh, you drink coffee.</i>

678
00:51:59,526 --> 00:52:02,861
Can I go up to my room
and get my fire engine?

679
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,992
Not right now. Daddy's asleep.

680
00:52:07,993 --> 00:52:11,579
I won't make any noise.

681
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,664
Now come on, Doc.

682
00:52:13,665 --> 00:52:15,640
He only went to bed a few hours ago.

683
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,585
Can't you wait till later?

684
00:52:17,586 --> 00:52:22,586
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.

685
00:52:22,633 --> 00:52:25,426
Well, all right.

686
00:52:25,427 --> 00:52:28,012
But really don't make a sound.

687
00:52:28,013 --> 00:52:30,306
I won't, mom.

688
00:52:30,307 --> 00:52:32,025
Make sure you come right back...

689
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,744
'coz I'm gonna
make lunch soon.

690
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:37,728
- Okay?
- <i>Okay, Mom.</i>

691
00:53:27,156 --> 00:53:30,070
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

692
00:53:34,037 --> 00:53:35,827
Come here for a minute first.

693
00:54:13,243 --> 00:54:16,412
How's it going, Doc?

694
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:19,624
Okay.

695
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:23,503
Having a good time?

696
00:54:23,504 --> 00:54:27,882
Yes, Dad.

697
00:54:27,883 --> 00:54:31,302
Good.

698
00:54:31,303 --> 00:54:34,180
I want you to have a good time.

699
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:35,196
I am, Dad.

700
00:54:42,189 --> 00:54:44,273
Dad?

701
00:54:44,274 --> 00:54:46,275
Yes?

702
00:54:46,276 --> 00:54:50,738
Do you feel bad?

703
00:54:50,739 --> 00:54:53,991
No.

704
00:54:53,992 --> 00:54:57,870
I'm just a little bit tired.

705
00:54:57,871 --> 00:55:02,871
Then why don't you go to sleep?

706
00:55:04,002 --> 00:55:07,046
I can't.

707
00:55:07,047 --> 00:55:12,047
I got too much to do.

708
00:55:12,636 --> 00:55:15,805
Dad?

709
00:55:15,806 --> 00:55:18,641
Yes?

710
00:55:18,642 --> 00:55:23,642
Do you like this hotel?

711
00:55:24,273 --> 00:55:26,941
Yes.

712
00:55:26,942 --> 00:55:29,318
I do.

713
00:55:29,319 --> 00:55:32,822
I love it.

714
00:55:32,823 --> 00:55:36,534
Don't you?

715
00:55:36,535 --> 00:55:40,663
I guess so.

716
00:55:40,664 --> 00:55:41,687
Good.

717
00:55:45,085 --> 00:55:50,085
I want you to like it here.

718
00:55:51,383 --> 00:55:55,011
I wish we could stay here forever...

719
00:55:55,012 --> 00:55:57,471
and ever...

720
00:55:57,472 --> 00:56:01,225
and ever.

721
00:56:01,226 --> 00:56:04,228
Dad?

722
00:56:04,229 --> 00:56:06,522
What?

723
00:56:06,523 --> 00:56:11,523
You would never hurt mommy or me,
would you?

724
00:56:15,115 --> 00:56:20,115
What do you mean?

725
00:56:21,705 --> 00:56:24,999
Did your mother
ever say that to you?

726
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,543
That I would hurt you?

727
00:56:27,544 --> 00:56:31,088
No, Dad.

728
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:33,215
You sure?

729
00:56:33,216 --> 00:56:34,270
Yes, Dad.

730
00:56:39,556 --> 00:56:42,808
I love you, Danny.

731
00:56:42,809 --> 00:56:45,603
I love you more than anything else...

732
00:56:45,604 --> 00:56:48,939
in the whole world...

733
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,318
and I would never do anything
to hurt you...

734
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,403
never.

735
00:56:54,404 --> 00:56:56,656
You know that, don't you?

736
00:56:56,657 --> 00:56:59,450
- Hm?
- Yes, Dad.

737
00:56:59,451 --> 00:57:00,474
Good.

738
00:57:42,035 --> 00:57:43,081
Mom?

739
00:58:01,263 --> 00:58:02,286
Mom?

740
00:58:28,498 --> 00:58:33,498
Mom, are you in there?

741
00:59:33,956 --> 00:59:35,058
Jack!

742
00:59:37,192 --> 00:59:40,378
Jack? Jack!

743
00:59:44,157 --> 00:59:45,172
Jack!

744
00:59:49,496 --> 00:59:50,746
What happened?

745
00:59:50,747 --> 00:59:52,873
Honey...

746
00:59:52,874 --> 00:59:55,125
what's wrong?

747
00:59:55,126 --> 00:59:56,141
Jack?

748
01:00:02,425 --> 01:00:04,051
I had the most...

749
01:00:04,052 --> 01:00:06,839
terrible nightmare I ever had.

750
01:00:08,598 --> 01:00:10,635
It was the most
horrible dream I ever had.

751
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,726
It's okay, it's okay now.

752
01:00:12,727 --> 01:00:13,734
Really.

753
01:00:18,495 --> 01:00:20,150
I dreamed that I...

754
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:22,565
that I killed you and Danny.

755
01:00:25,365 --> 01:00:28,909
But I didn't just kill you...

756
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:31,456
I cut you up into little pieces.

757
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,526
My God...

758
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:41,422
I must be losing my mind.

759
01:00:41,423 --> 01:00:46,135
Everything's going to be all right.

760
01:00:46,136 --> 01:00:51,136
Come on.
Let's get up off the floor.

761
01:00:55,729 --> 01:00:59,648
It's okay. There.
Now sit up.

762
01:00:59,649 --> 01:01:00,953
It's okay.

763
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:03,289
- Honey... it's okay.
- Yeah.

764
01:01:07,532 --> 01:01:09,033
Danny!

765
01:01:09,034 --> 01:01:11,160
Everything's okay!

766
01:01:11,161 --> 01:01:14,663
Just go play in your room for a while.

767
01:01:14,664 --> 01:01:18,042
Your dad's just got a headache.

768
01:01:18,043 --> 01:01:23,043
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

769
01:01:23,048 --> 01:01:26,175
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.

770
01:01:26,176 --> 01:01:28,135
I'll be right back.

771
01:01:28,136 --> 01:01:29,637
Danny.

772
01:01:29,638 --> 01:01:31,438
Why don't you mind me?

773
01:01:34,328 --> 01:01:35,758
Oh, Danny.

774
01:01:38,313 --> 01:01:41,333
Oh, my God...

775
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:44,526
Danny, what happened
to your neck?

776
01:01:44,527 --> 01:01:48,322
Danny, what happened to your neck?

777
01:01:48,323 --> 01:01:49,362
Huh?

778
01:02:16,768 --> 01:02:19,186
You did this to him...

779
01:02:19,187 --> 01:02:21,408
didn't you?!

780
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,733
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

781
01:02:24,734 --> 01:02:26,777
<i>You did this to him!</i>

782
01:02:26,778 --> 01:02:29,571
<i>Didn't you?!</i>

783
01:02:29,572 --> 01:02:31,448
How could you?!

784
01:02:31,449 --> 01:02:36,449
How could you?!

785
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:41,789
Oh.

786
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:06,087
God! I'd give anything for a drink.

787
01:04:08,797 --> 01:04:11,882
I'd give my goddamn soul...

788
01:04:11,883 --> 01:04:14,361
for just a glass of beer.

789
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:34,359
Hi, Lloyd.

790
01:04:34,405 --> 01:04:36,701
A little slow tonight, isn't it?

791
01:04:41,704 --> 01:04:46,041
Yes, it is, Mr. Torrance.

792
01:04:46,042 --> 01:04:49,169
What will it be?

793
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:52,339
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

794
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:55,884
because I just happen to have
two twenties...

795
01:04:55,885 --> 01:04:58,971
and two tens
right here in my wallet.

796
01:04:58,972 --> 01:05:02,933
I was afraid they were
gonna be there until next April.

797
01:05:02,934 --> 01:05:05,060
So, here's what -

798
01:05:05,061 --> 01:05:07,563
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

799
01:05:07,564 --> 01:05:10,566
a little glass and some ice.

800
01:05:10,567 --> 01:05:13,068
You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?

801
01:05:13,069 --> 01:05:15,988
<i>You're not too busy, are you?</i>

802
01:05:15,989 --> 01:05:18,991
No, sir. I'm not busy at all.

803
01:05:18,992 --> 01:05:20,742
<i>Good man.</i>

804
01:05:20,767 --> 01:05:21,601
<i>You set them up...</i>

805
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:26,248
and I'll knock 'em back, Lloyd,
one by one.

806
01:05:26,249 --> 01:05:29,376
White man's burden, Lloyd, my man.

807
01:05:29,377 --> 01:05:31,329
White man's burden.

808
01:05:37,594 --> 01:05:38,744
Say, Lloyd...

809
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:42,055
it seems I'm temporarily light.

810
01:05:42,056 --> 01:05:44,766
How's my credit in this joint, anyway?

811
01:05:44,767 --> 01:05:47,071
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

812
01:05:47,954 --> 01:05:49,646
That's swell.

813
01:05:49,647 --> 01:05:51,565
I like you, Lloyd.

814
01:05:51,566 --> 01:05:53,442
I always liked you.

815
01:05:53,443 --> 01:05:55,944
You were always the best of them.

816
01:05:55,945 --> 01:06:01,658
Best goddamned bartender
from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.

817
01:06:01,659 --> 01:06:04,304
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.

818
01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:05,774
Thank you for saying so.

819
01:06:08,374 --> 01:06:13,128
Here's to five miserable months
on the wagon...

820
01:06:13,129 --> 01:06:18,129
and all the irreparable harm
that it's caused me.

821
01:06:35,401 --> 01:06:39,196
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?

822
01:06:39,197 --> 01:06:43,325
Things could be better, Lloyd.

823
01:06:43,326 --> 01:06:46,954
Things could be
a whole lot better.

824
01:06:46,955 --> 01:06:49,581
I hope it's nothing serious.

825
01:06:49,582 --> 01:06:52,292
No.

826
01:06:52,293 --> 01:06:55,672
Nothing serious.

827
01:06:55,711 --> 01:07:02,010
Just a little problem with the...
old sperm bank upstairs.

828
01:07:02,011 --> 01:07:04,596
Nothing I can't handle, though, Lloyd.

829
01:07:04,597 --> 01:07:06,765
Thanks.

830
01:07:06,766 --> 01:07:07,975
Women.

831
01:07:07,976 --> 01:07:09,685
Can't live with them...

832
01:07:09,686 --> 01:07:11,279
can't live without them.

833
01:07:14,732 --> 01:07:16,525
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.

834
01:07:16,526 --> 01:07:18,193
Words of...

835
01:07:18,194 --> 01:07:19,217
wisdom.

836
01:07:31,207 --> 01:07:34,668
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

837
01:07:34,669 --> 01:07:38,338
I didn't.

838
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:43,339
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

839
01:07:43,553 --> 01:07:48,265
I love the little son of a bitch.

840
01:07:48,266 --> 01:07:51,310
I'd do anything for him.

841
01:07:51,311 --> 01:07:56,311
Any fucking thing for him.

842
01:07:58,192 --> 01:08:01,737
<i>But that bitch!</i>

843
01:08:01,738 --> 01:08:03,739
As long as I live...

844
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:08,740
she'll never let me forget
what happened.

845
01:08:16,753 --> 01:08:19,921
I did hurt him once, okay?

846
01:08:19,922 --> 01:08:22,299
It was an accident.

847
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:26,178
Completely unintentional.

848
01:08:26,179 --> 01:08:30,140
It could have happened to anybody.

849
01:08:30,141 --> 01:08:33,810
And it was three goddamn years ago!

850
01:08:33,811 --> 01:08:36,676
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

851
01:08:36,701 --> 01:08:39,160
All I tried to do was pull him up.

852
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:47,111
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

853
01:08:47,116 --> 01:08:48,867
I mean...

854
01:08:48,868 --> 01:08:52,372
a few extra foot-pounds of energy...

855
01:08:52,397 --> 01:08:55,231
per second, per second.

856
01:08:59,921 --> 01:09:01,536
<i>Jack!</i>

857
01:09:09,806 --> 01:09:11,478
Oh, Jack.

858
01:09:11,503 --> 01:09:13,135
Thank God you're here.

859
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,596
Jack.

860
01:09:16,621 --> 01:09:19,106
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

861
01:09:19,107 --> 01:09:21,817
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

862
01:09:21,818 --> 01:09:26,818
She tried to strangle Danny.

863
01:09:26,948 --> 01:09:29,616
Are you out of your fucking mind?

864
01:09:29,617 --> 01:09:31,284
No.

865
01:09:31,285 --> 01:09:32,994
It is the truth!
Really.

866
01:09:32,995 --> 01:09:35,831
I swear it. Danny told me.

867
01:09:35,832 --> 01:09:37,916
He went up into one of the bedrooms.

868
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:41,586
The door was open and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

869
01:09:41,587 --> 01:09:43,805
She tried to strangle him!

870
01:09:47,547 --> 01:09:49,079
Which room was it?

871
01:09:57,019 --> 01:09:59,354
<i>From Channel 10 in Miami...</i>

872
01:09:59,355 --> 01:10:01,940
<i>this is Newswatch
with Glenn Rinker,</i>

873
01:10:01,941 --> 01:10:06,486
<i>Ann Bishop and
the award-winning Newswatch team.</i>

874
01:10:06,487 --> 01:10:09,114
<i>Good evening.
I'm Glenn Rinker, Newswatch 10.</i>

875
01:10:09,115 --> 01:10:12,451
<i>While Miami continues to swelter
in a record winter heat wave...</i>

876
01:10:12,452 --> 01:10:14,786
<i>bringing temperatures
to the mid and upper 90s...</i>

877
01:10:14,787 --> 01:10:18,123
<i>the central and Rocky Mountain states
are buried in snow.</i>

878
01:10:18,124 --> 01:10:22,335
<i>In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
has fallen in just a few hours tonight.</i>

879
01:10:22,336 --> 01:10:24,754
<i>Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.</i>

880
01:10:24,755 --> 01:10:27,924
<i>Airports are shut down,
stranding thousands of passengers.</i>

881
01:10:27,925 --> 01:10:30,051
<i>Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.</i>

882
01:10:30,052 --> 01:10:32,012
<i>Railroad tracks are frozen.</i>

883
01:10:32,013 --> 01:10:34,222
<i>Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch...</i>

884
01:10:34,223 --> 01:10:38,018
<i>at least three have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.</i>

885
01:10:38,019 --> 01:10:40,520
<i>The governor of Colorado
is expected tomorrow...</i>

886
01:10:40,521 --> 01:10:42,439
<i>to declare a weather emergency.</i>

887
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,135
<i>The National Guard
might be called out</i>

888
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,901
<i>to clear Streets and roads.</i>

889
01:10:45,902 --> 01:10:48,320
<i>Weather forecasters
predict more snow...</i>

890
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:50,530
<i>and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...</i>

891
01:10:50,531 --> 01:10:53,366
<i>with temperatures dropping
well below zero.</i>

892
01:10:53,367 --> 01:10:56,578
<i>Back here, in South Florida,
we've got just the opposite problem.</i>

893
01:10:56,579 --> 01:10:58,997
<i>The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.</i>

894
01:10:58,998 --> 01:11:01,166
<i>Local beaches should be jammed.</i>

895
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:03,418
<i>Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...</i>

896
01:11:03,419 --> 01:11:06,838
<i>will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.</i>

897
01:16:39,036 --> 01:16:43,106
<i>We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.</i>

898
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:45,770
<i>If you need assistance,
please call the operator.</i>

899
01:17:01,995 --> 01:17:03,641
Jack?

900
01:17:03,666 --> 01:17:05,219
<i>Yes, it's me.</i>

901
01:17:05,244 --> 01:17:06,860
Oh, thank God.

902
01:17:11,954 --> 01:17:13,955
Did you find anything?

903
01:17:13,956 --> 01:17:17,292
No. Nothing at all.

904
01:17:17,293 --> 01:17:22,293
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

905
01:17:23,173 --> 01:17:26,714
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

906
01:17:26,739 --> 01:17:28,612
Yes, I did.

907
01:17:28,637 --> 01:17:30,721
And you didn't see anything at all?

908
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:32,901
Absolutely nothing.

909
01:17:32,926 --> 01:17:34,323
How is he?

910
01:17:34,348 --> 01:17:36,557
He's still asleep.

911
01:17:36,582 --> 01:17:37,596
Good.

912
01:17:43,531 --> 01:17:46,250
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

913
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:53,767
Are you sure it was the right room?

914
01:17:53,792 --> 01:17:57,275
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

915
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,790
He must have gone in that room.

916
01:17:59,815 --> 01:18:02,033
The door was open,
the lights were on.

917
01:18:05,257 --> 01:18:07,181
I just don't understand it.

918
01:18:11,931 --> 01:18:14,490
What about those bruises on his neck?

919
01:18:16,987 --> 01:18:19,045
Somebody did that to him.

920
01:18:27,526 --> 01:18:30,698
I think...

921
01:18:30,723 --> 01:18:32,659
he did it to himself.

922
01:18:39,296 --> 01:18:41,214
No.

923
01:18:41,215 --> 01:18:42,682
That's not possible.

924
01:18:45,761 --> 01:18:48,555
Wendy...

925
01:18:48,556 --> 01:18:52,433
once you rule out his version
of what happened...

926
01:18:52,434 --> 01:18:55,401
there is no other explanation.

927
01:18:55,448 --> 01:18:56,901
Is there?

928
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:02,081
It wouldn't be that different
from the episode

929
01:19:02,106 --> 01:19:05,815
that he had before
we came up here.

930
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,885
Would it?

931
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,039
<i>Oh, Jack.</i>

932
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:20,040
<i>Whatever the explanation is...</i>

933
01:19:21,371 --> 01:19:23,089
<i>I think we...</i>

934
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:28,090
<i>have to get Danny out of here.</i>

935
01:19:30,598 --> 01:19:34,017
Get him out of here?

936
01:19:34,018 --> 01:19:36,603
Yes.

937
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:39,355
You mean, just...

938
01:19:39,356 --> 01:19:42,358
leave the hotel?

939
01:19:42,359 --> 01:19:43,408
Yes.

940
01:19:50,326 --> 01:19:51,763
<i>It is so...</i>

941
01:19:51,788 --> 01:19:54,537
fucking typical of you
to create a problem like this...

942
01:19:54,538 --> 01:19:57,290
when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!

943
01:19:57,291 --> 01:20:00,199
When I'm really into my work!

944
01:20:00,224 --> 01:20:04,213
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back to Boulder now, couldn't I?

945
01:20:04,214 --> 01:20:08,176
Shoveling out driveways,
work in a car wash...

946
01:20:08,177 --> 01:20:10,428
- Any of that appeal to you?
- Jack...

947
01:20:10,429 --> 01:20:14,349
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life
so far...

948
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:17,764
but I am not gonna
let you fuck this up.

949
01:21:35,931 --> 01:21:37,890
<i>Good evening.
Forest Service.</i>

950
01:21:37,891 --> 01:21:40,435
Hello, my name is Dick Hallorann.

951
01:21:40,436 --> 01:21:43,062
I'm the head chef,
up at the Overlook Hotel.

952
01:21:43,063 --> 01:21:45,484
<i>Good evening, Mr. Hallorann.
What can I do for you?</i>

953
01:21:45,509 --> 01:21:49,152
Sir, I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

954
01:21:49,153 --> 01:21:52,655
but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

955
01:21:52,656 --> 01:21:56,451
Yeah, I'm afraid, a lot of lines
around here are down due to the storm.

956
01:21:56,452 --> 01:21:59,328
Well, look Sir, I hate to put you
through any trouble...

957
01:21:59,329 --> 01:22:02,790
but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

958
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:04,625
And with this storm
and everything...

959
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:07,754
I'd sure appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

960
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:10,256
just to see if everything's okay.

961
01:22:10,257 --> 01:22:11,758
I'll be glad to do that, Sir.

962
01:22:11,759 --> 01:22:14,857
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

963
01:22:14,882 --> 01:22:17,083
<i>Thank you very much.
I'll do that.</i>

964
01:22:17,108 --> 01:22:18,866
All right, sir.

965
01:22:38,744 --> 01:22:40,912
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

966
01:22:40,913 --> 01:22:45,913
Good evening.

967
01:23:06,939 --> 01:23:08,606
Hi, Lloyd.

968
01:23:08,607 --> 01:23:10,733
Been away, but now I'm back.

969
01:23:10,734 --> 01:23:13,152
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

970
01:23:13,153 --> 01:23:14,362
It's good to see you.

971
01:23:14,363 --> 01:23:17,042
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

972
01:23:17,823 --> 01:23:19,066
What'll it be, sir?

973
01:23:20,378 --> 01:23:23,871
Hair of the dog that bit me.

974
01:23:23,872 --> 01:23:25,503
Bourbon on the rocks.

975
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:27,714
That'll do her.

976
01:23:41,265 --> 01:23:44,976
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

977
01:23:44,977 --> 01:23:46,953
No charge?

978
01:23:47,703 --> 01:23:49,570
Your money's no good here.

979
01:23:55,237 --> 01:24:00,158
Orders from the house.

980
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:05,159
Orders from the house.

981
01:24:05,914 --> 01:24:10,084
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

982
01:24:10,085 --> 01:24:15,085
I'm the kind of man that likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

983
01:24:16,925 --> 01:24:20,094
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

984
01:24:20,095 --> 01:24:21,759
At least, not at this point.

985
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:29,645
Anything you say, Lloyd-

986
01:24:29,646 --> 01:24:31,501
Anything you say.

987
01:24:43,452 --> 01:24:44,510
Oh!

988
01:24:44,535 --> 01:24:47,371
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
I'm so sorry, sir.

989
01:24:47,372 --> 01:24:49,874
- Oh.
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

990
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:52,418
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

991
01:24:52,419 --> 01:24:57,419
Oh, that's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

992
01:24:57,507 --> 01:25:00,509
I'm afraid it's Advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

993
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:01,898
Advocaat, is it?

994
01:25:01,923 --> 01:25:04,222
Yes, sir. Look, I think
the best thing is to...

995
01:25:04,223 --> 01:25:06,718
come along to the
gentlemen's room, sir, and...

996
01:25:06,743 --> 01:25:08,805
we'll get some water to it, sir.

997
01:25:10,157 --> 01:25:13,481
Looks as though you might have
got a spot of it on yourself there...

998
01:25:13,482 --> 01:25:14,908
Jeevesy old boy.

999
01:25:14,933 --> 01:25:18,244
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.

1000
01:25:18,269 --> 01:25:21,072
Awfully nice of you to say.

1001
01:25:21,097 --> 01:25:24,126
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...

1002
01:25:24,151 --> 01:25:26,535
before the fish and goose soiree.

1003
01:25:26,536 --> 01:25:28,788
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

1004
01:25:28,789 --> 01:25:31,082
<i>Here. I'll just...</i>

1005
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:33,542
hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.

1006
01:25:33,543 --> 01:25:36,379
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1007
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:40,216
Now, let's see if we can improve this
with a little water, sir.

1008
01:25:40,217 --> 01:25:41,676
All right. I'll just...

1009
01:25:41,677 --> 01:25:46,472
set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

1010
01:25:46,473 --> 01:25:48,099
Won't keep you a moment, sir.

1011
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,123
Fine.

1012
01:25:52,482 --> 01:25:54,438
What do they call you
around here, Jeevesy?

1013
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:56,759
Grady, sir.
Delbert Grady.

1014
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:02,947
Grady?

1015
01:26:02,948 --> 01:26:05,324
Yes, sir.

1016
01:26:05,325 --> 01:26:06,867
Delbert Grady.

1017
01:26:06,868 --> 01:26:08,141
That's right, sir.

1018
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:17,086
Uh...

1019
01:26:17,087 --> 01:26:19,297
Mr. Grady...

1020
01:26:19,298 --> 01:26:21,590
haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

1021
01:26:21,591 --> 01:26:26,591
Why, no, sir.
I don't believe so.

1022
01:26:31,351 --> 01:26:34,353
It's coming off now, sir.

1023
01:26:34,354 --> 01:26:38,107
Uh...

1024
01:26:38,108 --> 01:26:41,193
Mr. Grady...

1025
01:26:41,194 --> 01:26:43,863
weren't you once
the caretaker here?

1026
01:26:43,864 --> 01:26:48,864
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

1027
01:26:49,703 --> 01:26:53,247
You a married man, are you, Mr. Grady?

1028
01:26:53,248 --> 01:26:54,254
Yes, sir.

1029
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:58,586
I have a wife and two daughters, sir.

1030
01:26:58,587 --> 01:27:01,756
And...

1031
01:27:01,757 --> 01:27:03,086
where are they now?

1032
01:27:03,111 --> 01:27:06,906
Well, they're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

1033
01:27:15,304 --> 01:27:17,980
Mr. Grady.

1034
01:27:17,981 --> 01:27:21,859
You were the caretaker here.

1035
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:25,237
I recognize you.

1036
01:27:25,238 --> 01:27:28,741
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.

1037
01:27:28,742 --> 01:27:30,951
You...

1038
01:27:30,952 --> 01:27:34,997
chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

1039
01:27:34,998 --> 01:27:36,952
And...

1040
01:27:36,977 --> 01:27:38,647
and you blew your brains out.

1041
01:27:48,887 --> 01:27:51,639
That's strange, sir.

1042
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:56,640
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

1043
01:27:58,063 --> 01:28:00,356
Mr. Grady...

1044
01:28:00,357 --> 01:28:05,357
you were the caretaker here.

1045
01:28:11,493 --> 01:28:16,163
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

1046
01:28:16,164 --> 01:28:18,624
But you...

1047
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:22,711
are the caretaker.

1048
01:28:22,712 --> 01:28:27,712
You've always been the caretaker.

1049
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:31,804
I should know, sir.

1050
01:28:31,805 --> 01:28:36,805
I've always been here.

1051
01:28:52,617 --> 01:28:55,035
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

1052
01:28:55,036 --> 01:28:57,204
that your son...

1053
01:28:57,205 --> 01:29:00,124
is attempting to bring
an outside party...

1054
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:04,879
into this situation?

1055
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,325
Did you know that?

1056
01:29:10,208 --> 01:29:11,372
No.

1057
01:29:12,846 --> 01:29:17,266
He is, Mr. Torrance.

1058
01:29:17,267 --> 01:29:20,686
Who?

1059
01:29:20,687 --> 01:29:21,710
A nigger.

1060
01:29:26,401 --> 01:29:27,580
A nigger?

1061
01:29:30,408 --> 01:29:32,975
A nigger... cook.

1062
01:29:39,748 --> 01:29:43,292
How?

1063
01:29:43,293 --> 01:29:45,503
Your son...

1064
01:29:45,504 --> 01:29:49,256
has a very great talent.

1065
01:29:49,257 --> 01:29:53,511
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

1066
01:29:53,512 --> 01:29:56,931
But he is attempting to
use that very talent...

1067
01:29:56,932 --> 01:29:58,767
against your will.

1068
01:30:07,442 --> 01:30:11,667
Well...

1069
01:30:11,692 --> 01:30:14,262
he is a very willful boy.

1070
01:30:17,035 --> 01:30:19,578
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

1071
01:30:19,579 --> 01:30:22,665
A very willful boy.

1072
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:24,208
A rather...

1073
01:30:24,209 --> 01:30:25,960
naughty boy...

1074
01:30:25,961 --> 01:30:30,961
if I may be so bold, sir.

1075
01:30:36,388 --> 01:30:40,307
It's his mother.

1076
01:30:40,308 --> 01:30:41,976
She...

1077
01:30:41,977 --> 01:30:43,828
interferes.

1078
01:30:47,172 --> 01:30:50,359
Perhaps they need a good...

1079
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,475
talking-to.

1080
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,803
If...

1081
01:30:53,828 --> 01:30:56,991
you don't mind my saying so.

1082
01:30:56,992 --> 01:30:59,159
Perhaps...

1083
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,844
a bit more.

1084
01:31:04,102 --> 01:31:05,499
My girls, sir...

1085
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:10,004
they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.

1086
01:31:10,005 --> 01:31:14,091
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

1087
01:31:14,092 --> 01:31:17,845
and tried to burn it down.

1088
01:31:17,846 --> 01:31:19,680
But I...

1089
01:31:19,681 --> 01:31:23,017
corrected them, sir.

1090
01:31:23,018 --> 01:31:27,354
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

1091
01:31:27,355 --> 01:31:29,607
I...

1092
01:31:29,608 --> 01:31:34,608
corrected her.

1093
01:31:45,915 --> 01:31:50,915
We have the Snowcat.

1094
01:31:51,254 --> 01:31:53,213
If the weather breaks...

1095
01:31:53,214 --> 01:31:55,215
we might just be able to...

1096
01:31:55,216 --> 01:31:58,135
get down the mountain.

1097
01:31:59,929 --> 01:32:03,098
I could call
the forest rangers first...

1098
01:32:03,099 --> 01:32:04,725
and...

1099
01:32:04,726 --> 01:32:06,977
tell them that we're coming...

1100
01:32:06,978 --> 01:32:08,354
so that...

1101
01:32:08,355 --> 01:32:13,355
they could start searching for us,
in case we didn't make it.

1102
01:32:16,237 --> 01:32:20,866
And if Jack won't come with us...

1103
01:32:20,867 --> 01:32:24,880
I'll just have to tell him that
we're going by ourselves.

1104
01:32:24,905 --> 01:32:26,655
That's all there is to it.

Hello.
This is Dick Hallorann again.

1145
01:35:16,918 --> 01:35:20,212
I called a while ago about
the folks at the Overlook Hotel.

1146
01:35:20,213 --> 01:35:21,380
Oh, yeah.

1147
01:35:21,381 --> 01:35:25,259
We tried to contact them several
times by radio, but they didn't answer.

1148
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:27,088
Now, maybe they got
their radio turned off...

1149
01:35:27,113 --> 01:35:29,096
or they're in a place
where they can't hear it.

1150
01:35:29,097 --> 01:35:32,474
If you'd like me to, I'd be glad
to try again later on.

1151
01:35:32,475 --> 01:35:34,810
Oh, that's very nice of you.

1152
01:35:34,811 --> 01:35:36,770
I'll call you back later.

1153
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:37,802
Bye.

1154
01:36:24,903 --> 01:36:28,155
Pardon me, miss.
What time will we get to Denver?

1155
01:36:28,156 --> 01:36:30,490
We're due to arrive at 8:20, sir.

1156
01:36:30,491 --> 01:36:32,312
Thank you very much.

1157
01:37:35,932 --> 01:37:37,140

01:37:37,141 --> 01:37:38,433
<i>Hello, can I speak to Larry?</i>

1159
01:37:38,434 --> 01:37:39,726
Speaking.

1160
01:37:39,727 --> 01:37:42,521
Hi, Larry. This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.

1161
01:37:42,522 --> 01:37:44,398
Dick! How you doing?

1162
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:45,941
How's the weather down there?

1163
01:37:45,942 --> 01:37:49,486
I'm not in Florida, Larry.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.

1164
01:37:49,487 --> 01:37:51,096
What the hell are you
doing down there?

1165
01:37:51,572 --> 01:37:55,158
Well, I just got in from Miami and
I gotta get up to the Overlook today.

1166
01:37:55,159 --> 01:37:57,411
What's the weather like up there?

1167
01:37:57,412 --> 01:38:00,497
Well, the snowplows are
keeping things moving in town...

1168
01:38:00,498 --> 01:38:02,958
but the mountain roads
are blocked.

1169
01:38:02,959 --> 01:38:05,877
That means I'm going to need
a Snowcat to get up there, Larry.

1170
01:38:05,878 --> 01:38:07,921
Can you fix me up with one?

1171
01:38:07,922 --> 01:38:10,215
What's the big deal about
getting up there today...

1172
01:38:10,216 --> 01:38:12,634
especially in this kind of weather?

1173
01:38:12,635 --> 01:38:16,461
Larry, just between you and me,
we got a very serious problem

1174
01:38:16,486 --> 01:38:18,765
with the people who're
taking care of the place.

1175
01:38:18,766 --> 01:38:22,898
They turned out to be
completely unreliable assholes.

1176
01:38:22,923 --> 01:38:24,813
Ullman phoned me last night...

1177
01:38:24,814 --> 01:38:29,651
and I'm supposed to go up and
find out if they have to be replaced.

1178
01:38:29,652 --> 01:38:32,029
How long is it gonna
take you to get up here?

1179
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:33,905
Oh, about five hours.

1180
01:38:33,906 --> 01:38:36,616
I'm going to rent a car
here at the airport.

1181
01:38:36,617 --> 01:38:38,577
Okay, Dick, I'll take care of it.

1182
01:38:38,578 --> 01:38:41,621
Oh, thanks a lot, Larry.
I really appreciate that.

1183
01:38:41,622 --> 01:38:44,577

01:44:41,649 --> 01:44:45,777
<i>to talk to you.</i>

1223
01:44:45,778 --> 01:44:47,654
Okay.

1224
01:44:47,655 --> 01:44:52,655
Let's talk.

1225
01:44:58,916 --> 01:45:03,916
What do you wanna talk about?

1226
01:45:06,924 --> 01:45:08,842
I...

1227
01:45:08,843 --> 01:45:12,804
<i>I can't really remember.</i>

1228
01:45:12,805 --> 01:45:15,723
You can't remember.

1229
01:45:15,724 --> 01:45:17,434
No...

1230
01:45:17,435 --> 01:45:18,474
I can't.

1231
01:45:24,150 --> 01:45:27,759
<font color="#878787">JACK</font>:
<i> Maybe it's about... Danny?</i>

1232
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:34,780
<i>Maybe it was about him.</i>

1233
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:41,120
<i>I think we should discuss Danny.</i>

1234
01:45:42,209 --> 01:45:44,419
<i>I think...</i>

1235
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:49,420
we <i>should discuss
what should be done with him.</i>

1236
01:45:52,887 --> 01:45:57,887
What should be done with him?

1237
01:46:00,478 --> 01:46:02,770
I don't know.

1238
01:46:02,771 --> 01:46:04,981
I don't think that's true.

1239
01:46:04,982 --> 01:46:07,775
I think you have some
very definite ideas

1240
01:46:07,776 --> 01:46:09,694
about what should be
done with Danny...

1241
01:46:09,695 --> 01:46:14,199
and I'd like to know
what they are.

1242
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,284
Well, I...

1243
01:46:16,285 --> 01:46:20,914
I think maybe he should be
taken to a doctor.

1244
01:46:20,915 --> 01:46:24,417
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1245
01:46:24,418 --> 01:46:26,419
Yes.

1246
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:30,423
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1247
01:46:30,424 --> 01:46:32,383
As soon as possible?

1248
01:46:32,384 --> 01:46:34,455
"As soon as possible?"

1249
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:37,461
<i>Jack...</i>

1250
01:46:37,486 --> 01:46:38,619
Please.

1251
01:46:40,291 --> 01:46:42,853
You believe his health
might be at stake.

1252
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:46,189
Yes.

1253
01:46:48,205 --> 01:46:50,299
You are concerned about him.

1254
01:46:50,963 --> 01:46:52,252
Yes.

1255
01:46:53,283 --> 01:46:55,213
And are you concerned about me?

1256
01:46:56,369 --> 01:46:57,664
Of course I am.

1257
01:46:57,689 --> 01:46:59,564
<i>Of course you are!</i>

1258
01:47:00,431 --> 01:47:03,331
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

1259
01:47:03,332 --> 01:47:05,180
<i>Oh Jack, what are you
talking about?</i>

1260
01:47:05,205 --> 01:47:08,086
Have you ever had
a single moment's...

1261
01:47:08,087 --> 01:47:10,259
thought about
my responsibilities?

1262
01:47:10,284 --> 01:47:12,799
Have you ever thought for
a single, solitary moment...

1263
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,922
about my responsibilities
to my employers?!

1264
01:47:15,947 --> 01:47:17,111
Has it ever occurred to you

1265
01:47:17,136 --> 01:47:21,750
that I have agreed to look after
the Overlook Hotel until May 1st?

1266
01:47:21,775 --> 01:47:23,953
Does it matter to you at all...

1267
01:47:23,978 --> 01:47:26,986
that the owners have placed their
complete confidence and trust in me...

1268
01:47:27,011 --> 01:47:30,609
and that I have signed a letter
of agreement, a contract...

1269
01:47:30,634 --> 01:47:33,611
in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

1270
01:47:33,612 --> 01:47:35,891
<i>Do you have the slightest idea...</i>

1271
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:39,338
<i>what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!</i>

1272
01:47:39,564 --> 01:47:42,745
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

1273
01:47:42,746 --> 01:47:45,399
if I were to fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

1274
01:47:45,424 --> 01:47:47,914
<i>Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!</i>

1275
01:47:47,939 --> 01:47:49,424
Stay away from me!

1276
01:47:50,338 --> 01:47:51,629
Why?

1277
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:54,906
I just want to go back to my room.

1278
01:47:54,931 --> 01:47:56,103
Why?

1279
01:47:56,752 --> 01:47:58,678
Well...

1280
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:01,848
I'm very confused...

1281
01:48:01,849 --> 01:48:06,228
and I just need a chance
to think things over.

1282
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:10,690
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

1283
01:48:10,691 --> 01:48:13,353
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

1284
01:48:14,445 --> 01:48:16,279
Stay away from me!

1285
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:18,364
Please!

1286
01:48:18,365 --> 01:48:19,703
Don't hurt me.

1287
01:48:19,728 --> 01:48:21,159
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1288
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:22,213
Stay away from me!

1289
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:23,649
- Wendy.
- Stay away!

1290
01:48:23,674 --> 01:48:24,891
Darling.

1291
01:48:24,916 --> 01:48:26,831
Light of my life.

1292
01:48:26,832 --> 01:48:28,374
I'm not going to hurt you.

1293
01:48:28,375 --> 01:48:30,617
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

1294
01:48:30,642 --> 01:48:32,962
I said, "I'm not gonna hurt you".

1295
01:48:32,963 --> 01:48:35,361
I'm just gonna bash
your brains in.

1296
01:48:36,127 --> 01:48:40,125
I'm gonna bash them
right the fuck in.

1297
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:42,096
Stay away from me!

1298
01:48:42,097 --> 01:48:43,348
Don't hurt me!

1299
01:48:43,349 --> 01:48:46,017
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1300
01:48:46,018 --> 01:48:47,769
Stay away from me!

1301
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:49,729
Stay away!

1302
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:51,981
Please!

1303
01:48:51,982 --> 01:48:53,941
Stop swinging the bat.

1304
01:48:53,942 --> 01:48:55,985
Stay away from me.

1305
01:48:55,986 --> 01:48:57,487
Put that bat down, Wendy.

1306
01:48:57,488 --> 01:48:59,155
Stop it!

1307
01:48:59,156 --> 01:49:00,448
Wendy.

1308
01:49:00,449 --> 01:49:01,783
Give me the bat.

1309
01:49:01,784 --> 01:49:03,159
Please!

1310
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:05,578
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

1311
01:49:05,579 --> 01:49:06,871
Stop it!

1312
01:49:06,872 --> 01:49:08,623
- Give me the bat.
- Jack.

1313
01:49:08,624 --> 01:49:10,458
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.

1314
01:49:10,459 --> 01:49:12,043
Please stop!

1315
01:49:12,044 --> 01:49:13,419
Give me the bat.

1316
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:14,921
- Stay away from me.
- Wendy.

1317
01:49:14,922 --> 01:49:16,589
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat.

1318
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:17,832
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

1319
01:49:18,222 --> 01:49:19,566
Ah! Goddamn...!

1320
01:50:35,002 --> 01:50:37,503
What are you doing?

1321
01:50:37,504 --> 01:50:39,505
Hey.

1322
01:50:39,506 --> 01:50:42,383
Wait a minute.

1323
01:50:42,384 --> 01:50:47,221
What are you doing?

1324
01:50:47,222 --> 01:50:52,222
What are you doing?

1325
01:50:54,274 --> 01:50:55,289
Oh! Oh!

1326
01:51:01,531 --> 01:51:03,602
<i>Hey!
Wait a minute!</i>

1327
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:08,034
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1328
01:51:08,035 --> 01:51:11,078
<i>Open the door!</i>

1329
01:51:11,079 --> 01:51:12,330
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

1330
01:51:12,331 --> 01:51:17,331
<i>Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!</i>

1331
01:51:19,588 --> 01:51:21,255
Wendy, listen.

1332
01:51:21,256 --> 01:51:24,383
Let me out of here and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

1333
01:51:24,384 --> 01:51:29,384
It'll be just like
nothing ever happened.

1334
01:51:40,192 --> 01:51:44,111
Wendy, baby.

1335
01:51:44,112 --> 01:51:49,033
I think you hurt my head real bad.

1336
01:51:49,034 --> 01:51:51,702
I'm dizzy.

1337
01:51:51,703 --> 01:51:56,703
I need a doctor.

1338
01:52:00,754 --> 01:52:04,632
<i>Honey.</i>

1339
01:52:04,633 --> 01:52:09,633
<i>Don't leave me in here.</i>

1340
01:52:15,602 --> 01:52:20,565
I'm gonna go now.

1341
01:52:20,566 --> 01:52:22,608
I'm going to try to...

1342
01:52:22,609 --> 01:52:26,279
get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

1343
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:30,908
in the Snowcat today.

1344
01:52:30,909 --> 01:52:34,537
I'll bring back a doctor.

1345
01:52:34,538 --> 01:52:38,124
Wendy.

1346
01:52:38,125 --> 01:52:40,960
<i>I'm going to go now.</i>

1347
01:52:40,961 --> 01:52:44,881
Wendy.

1348
01:52:44,882 --> 01:52:47,425
Yes.

1349
01:52:47,426 --> 01:52:52,426
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

1350
01:52:52,681 --> 01:52:56,976
You're not going anywhere.

1351
01:52:56,977 --> 01:53:01,272
<i>Go check out the Snowcat and
the radio and you'll see what I mean.</i>

1352
01:53:05,788 --> 01:53:07,202
<i>Go check it out.</i>

1353
01:53:09,726 --> 01:53:12,171
Go check it out!

1354
01:53:15,393 --> 01:53:17,406
Go check it out.

1355
01:55:02,019 --> 01:55:05,062
Wendy?

1356
01:55:05,063 --> 01:55:08,190
<i>It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.</i>

1357
01:55:08,191 --> 01:55:11,736
<i>Delbert Grady.</i>

1358
01:55:11,761 --> 01:55:12,768
Grady?

1359
01:55:18,118 --> 01:55:23,118
Oh, Grady.

1360
01:55:24,374 --> 01:55:29,374
Grady, uh...

1361
01:55:33,675 --> 01:55:38,675
Hello, Grady.

1362
01:55:40,182 --> 01:55:43,934
<i>Mr. Torrance...</i>

1363
01:55:43,935 --> 01:55:47,895
<i>I see you can hardly
have taken care of the...</i>

1364
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:50,794
<i>business we discussed.</i>

1365
01:55:57,826 --> 01:56:01,410
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

1366
01:56:01,411 --> 01:56:06,332
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

1367
01:56:06,333 --> 01:56:09,585
<i>Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?</i>

1368
01:56:09,586 --> 01:56:12,588
<i>I wonder.</i>

1369
01:56:12,589 --> 01:56:15,883
<i>I have my doubts.</i>

1370
01:56:15,884 --> 01:56:20,346
<i>I and others,
have come to believe...</i>

1371
01:56:20,347 --> 01:56:23,974
<i>that your heart is not in this.</i>

1372
01:56:23,975 --> 01:56:26,318
<i>That you haven't the belly for it.</i>

1373
01:56:32,692 --> 01:56:37,692
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

1374
01:56:37,939 --> 01:56:39,268
That's all I ask.

1375
01:56:41,401 --> 01:56:45,746
<i>Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.</i>

1376
01:56:45,747 --> 01:56:47,414
<i>Somewhat more...</i>

1377
01:56:47,415 --> 01:56:49,667
<i>resourceful.</i>

1378
01:56:49,668 --> 01:56:54,668
<i>She seems to have got
the better of you.</i>

1379
01:56:55,674 --> 01:56:59,051
For the moment, Mr. Grady...

1380
01:56:59,052 --> 01:57:00,848
Only for the moment.

1381
01:57:03,239 --> 01:57:07,560
<i>I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...</i>

1382
01:57:07,561 --> 01:57:11,814
<i>in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.</i>

1383
01:57:11,815 --> 01:57:13,649
<i>I fear...</i>

1384
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:18,650
<i>that is the only thing to do.</i>

1385
01:57:19,698 --> 01:57:21,991
There's nothing I look forward to...

1386
01:57:21,992 --> 01:57:26,992
with greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.

1387
01:57:27,289 --> 01:57:31,500
<i>You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?</i>

1388
01:57:31,501 --> 01:57:33,282
I give you my word.
