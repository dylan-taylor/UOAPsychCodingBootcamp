1
00:00:35,388 --> 00:00:36,388
Hello?

2
00:00:36,472 --> 00:00:38,432
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Yes?

3
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:39,767
<i>Who is this?</i>

4
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:41,268
Who are you trying to reach?

5
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:42,603
<i>What number is this?</i>

6
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:44,438
What number are you trying to reach?

7
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:45,648
<i>I don't know.</i>

8
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:47,399
Well, I think you have the wrong number.

9
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:49,777
<i>- Do I?</i>
- It happens. Take it easy.

10
00:00:58,828 --> 00:00:59,829
Hello?

11
00:00:59,913 --> 00:01:02,414
<i>I'm sorry.
I guess I dialed the wrong number.</i>

12
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:04,291
Well, so why'd you dial it again?

13
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,001
<i>To apologize.</i>

14
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:07,878
You're forgiven. Bye now.

15
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:09,630
<i>Wait. Wait. Don't hang up.</i>

16
00:01:09,714 --> 00:01:12,008
- What?
<i>- I want to talk to you for a second.</i>

17
00:01:12,592 --> 00:01:14,761
They've got 900 numbers for that. See ya.

18
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:37,575
Hello?

19
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,660
<i>Why don't you want to talk to me?</i>

20
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:40,744
Who is this?

21
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:42,928
<i>You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.</i>

22
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:45,083
I don't think so.

23
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,918
<i>What's that noise?</i>

24
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:50,046
- Popcorn.
<i>- You're making popcorn?</i>

25
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:52,882
<i>I only eat popcorn at the movies.</i>

26
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:54,884
Well, I'm getting ready to watch a video.

27
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:56,385
<i>Really? What?</i>

28
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,637
Oh, just some scary movie.

29
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:00,264
<i>You like scary movies?</i>

30
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:02,850
<i>What's your favorite scary movie?</i>

31
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:04,476
I don't know.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,063
<i>You have to have a favorite.
What comes to mind?</i>

33
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:10,024
<i>Halloween.</i>

34
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:12,443
You know, the one
with the guy in the white mask

35
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:14,612
who walks around and stalks babysitters.

36
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:17,197
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- What's yours?

37
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:18,324
<i>Guess.</i>

38
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:22,036
<i>Nightmare on Elm Street.</i>

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,663
<i>Is that the one
where the guy had knives for fingers?</i>

40
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:25,998
Yeah, Freddy Krueger.

41
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:29,668
<i>Freddy. That's right.
I like that movie. It was scary.</i>

42
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:32,212
Well, the first one was,
but the rest sucked.

43
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:34,340
<i>So, you got a boyfriend?</i>

44
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:37,801
Why? You wanna ask me out on a date?

45
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:40,346
<i>Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?</i>

46
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:43,599
- No.
<i>- You never told me your name.</i>

47
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,392
Why do you want to know my name?

48
00:02:45,476 --> 00:02:47,526
<i>'Cause I want to know who I'm looking at.</i>

49
00:02:49,397 --> 00:02:50,523
What did you say?

50
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:53,943
<i>I want to know who I'm talking to.</i>

51
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:55,277
That's not what you said.

52
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:56,612
<i>What do you think I said?</i>

53
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:01,117
<i>What?</i>

54
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,661
<i>Hello?</i>

55
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:06,622
Look, I gotta go.

56
00:03:06,706 --> 00:03:08,556
<i>Wait. I thought we were gonna go out.</i>

57
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,001
Nah, I don't think so.

58
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:12,295
<i>Don't hang up on me.</i>

59
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:22,263
Shit.

60
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:25,057
Yes?

61
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:27,893
<i>I told you not to hang up on me.</i>

62
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:29,895
- What do you want?
<i>- To talk.</i>

63
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:32,231
Well, dial someone else, okay?

64
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:43,075
Listen, asshole...

65
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,702
<i>No, you listen, you little bitch!</i>

66
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:47,914
<i>You hang up on me again,
I'll gut you like a fish, understand?</i>

67
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,709
<i>Yeah.</i>

68
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:53,752
Is this some kind of joke?

69
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:56,172
<i>More of a game, really.</i>

70
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,675
<i>Can you handle that...</i>

71
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:02,887
<i>Blondie?</i>

72
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:15,483
<i>Can you see me?</i>

73
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:22,990
Listen. I am two seconds away
from calling the police.

74
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:27,327
<i>They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.</i>

75
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,038
What do you want?

76
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:32,375
<i>To see what your insides look like.</i>

77
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:41,801
Who's there?

78
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:44,220
Who's there?

79
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:46,848
I'm calling the police.

80
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:51,894
<i>You should never say, "Who's there?"</i>

81
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:54,605
<i>Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.</i>

82
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:59,148
<i>You might as well come out here to
investigate a strange noise or something.</i>

83
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:00,862
Look

84
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:05,199
you've had your fun now, so I think
you'd better just leave or else.

85
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:06,867
<i>Or else what?</i>

86
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:09,328
Or else my boyfriend
will be here any second,

87
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:11,663
and he'll be pissed when he finds out.

88
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:13,290
<i>I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.</i>

89
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:15,751
I lied! I do have a boyfriend,

90
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:18,128
and he'll be here any second,
so your ass better be gone.

91
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:19,297
<i>Sure.</i>

92
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:21,549
I swear.

93
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:27,596
He's big, and he plays football,
and he'll kick the shit out of you!

94
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,306
<i>I'm getting scared.</i>

95
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,933
<i>I'm shaking in my boots.</i>

96
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:33,727
So you'd better just leave.

97
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:35,646
<i>His name wouldn't be...</i>

98
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,231
<i>Steve, would it?</i>

99
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:41,319
How do you know his name?

100
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:43,738
<i>Turn on the patio lights</i>

101
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:45,615
<i>again.</i>

102
00:05:57,543 --> 00:05:58,711
Oh, God!

103
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:01,380
<i>I wouldn't do that if I were you.</i>

104
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:03,382
- Where are you? Where are you?
<i>- Guess.</i>

105
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,925
Please don't hurt him.

106
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:06,552
<i>That all depends on you.</i>

107
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:08,220
Why are you doing this?

108
00:06:08,304 --> 00:06:10,764
<i>- I want to play a game.</i>
- No.

109
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,433
<i>- Then he dies right now.</i>
- No! No!

110
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:14,727
<i>Which is it?</i>

111
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:17,396
<i>Which is it?</i>

112
00:06:19,982 --> 00:06:21,942
What kind of game?

113
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:26,030
<i>Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.</i>

114
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:28,032
<i>Just do it!</i>

115
00:06:30,993 --> 00:06:33,955
Casey! No! No!

116
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:36,081
No! Casey!

117
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:37,917
<i>Here's how we play.</i>

118
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:42,504
<i>I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.</i>

119
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:44,798
- Please don't do this.
<i>- Come on. It'll be fun.</i>

120
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:48,635
- Please. Please.
<i>- It's an easy category. Movie trivia.</i>

121
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:50,846
<i>I'll even give you a warm-up question.</i>

122
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,222
Don't do this. I can't...

123
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:55,434
<i>- Name the killer in</i> Halloween.
- No.

124
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:58,604
<i>Come on. It's your favorite
scary movie, remember?</i>

125
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:01,106
<i>He had a white mask.
He stalked the babysitters.</i>

126
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,150
- I don't know.
<i>- Come on. Yes, you do.</i>

127
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:06,570
- No. Please.
<i>- What's his name?</i>

128
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:09,615
- I can't think.
<i>- Steve's counting on you.</i>

129
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:13,827
Michael. Michael Myers.

130
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,413
<i>Yes! Very good.</i>

131
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:18,207
<i>Now for the real question.</i>

132
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,710
- No!
<i>- But you're doing so well.</i>

133
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:22,586
<i>We can't stop now.</i>

134
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,213
Stop! Leave us alone.

135
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:26,966
<i>Then answer the question. Same category.</i>

136
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:30,136
Oh, please, stop.

137
00:07:30,886 --> 00:07:33,972
<i>Name the killer in</i> Friday the 13th.

138
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:36,558
Jason! Jason! Jason!

139
00:07:36,642 --> 00:07:39,437
<i>I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.</i>

140
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:42,898
No, it's not! No, it's not. It was Jason!

141
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:45,525
<i>Afraid not. No way.</i>

142
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:49,112
Listen. It was Jason.
I saw that movie 20 goddamn times!

143
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:52,449
<i>Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs. Voorhees was the original killer.</i>

144
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:55,035
<i>Jason didn't show up until the sequel.</i>

145
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:57,871
<i>I'm afraid that was a wrong answer.</i>

146
00:07:57,955 --> 00:07:59,414
You tricked me.

147
00:07:59,498 --> 00:08:05,713
<i>Lucky for you, there's a bonus round,
but poor Steve. I'm afraid he's out.</i>

148
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:34,241
<i>Hey, we're not finished yet.</i>

149
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:38,579
<i>Final question. Are you ready?</i>

150
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:43,083
Please. Please leave me alone.

151
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,877
<i>Answer the question, and I will.</i>

152
00:08:46,712 --> 00:08:49,548
<i>What door am I at?</i>

153
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:51,258
What?

154
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:55,304
<i>There are two main doors to your house,
a front door and the patio doors.</i>

155
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:58,140
<i>If you answer correctly, you live.</i>

156
00:08:58,224 --> 00:08:59,475
<i>Very simple.</i>

157
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:02,186
<i>Don't do this. I can't. I won't.</i>

158
00:09:03,437 --> 00:09:04,855
<i>Your call.</i>

159
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,125
Did you water over here today?

160
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:32,586
No, it was just that water from the rain.

161
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,837
They look great, don't they?

162
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:35,422
Don't they smell strong?

163
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:37,156
I told you we could send it back.

164
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:41,387
Mom.

165
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:44,807
- Jesus!
- What is it?

166
00:11:58,654 --> 00:11:59,738
Casey!

167
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:04,785
Oh, God! Oh, God!

168
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:10,624
Casey? Casey?

169
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,418
Casey!

170
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,839
- Where is she?
- Call the police.

171
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:23,095
Casey!

172
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:25,388
- Casey, you upstairs?
- Oh, my God.

173
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:26,890
Casey, baby?

174
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:29,309
<i>- Where is she?
- She's here.</i>

175
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:32,187
- Mom... Mom...
<i>- Oh, my God. I can hear her.</i>

176
00:12:33,522 --> 00:12:34,690
<i>Where is she?</i>

177
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:38,902
Oh, my God. I can hear her.

178
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,284
Get in the car.

179
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:48,036
Drive down to the Mackenzies.

180
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,080
No, not my daughter.

181
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:51,790
- Just go.
- Not my daughter.

182
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:53,083
Call the police.

183
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:42,871
- It's just me.
- Billy, what the... What're you doing here?

184
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,331
- Sorry. Don't hate me.
- Oh, my God.

185
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,791
What, you sleep in that?

186
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,085
Yes, I sleep in this. My dad is
in the other room. You can't be in here.

187
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:51,046
- I'll just stay a sec.
- No, you can't...

188
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,256
Oh, no. You gotta go. Go. Go.

189
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,842
What's going on in there?

190
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:57,469
- Are you okay?
- Can you knock?

191
00:13:57,553 --> 00:13:59,387
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.

192
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,472
No?

193
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:03,601
Oh, well.

194
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:07,479
I'm hitting the sack. My flight
leaves first thing in the morning.

195
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:10,663
Now, the expo runs all weekend,
so I won't be back till Sunday.

196
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,943
There's cash on the table,
and I'm staying at...

197
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:15,028
- The Hilton.
- Out at the airport, so call if...

198
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:18,812
- If I need anything. Yeah, I got it.
- I could've sworn I heard screaming.

199
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:22,285
Have a good trip, okay?

200
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:23,579
Sleep tight, sweetie.

201
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:30,794
Close call.

202
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:33,047
Billy, what are you doing here?

203
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,222
Well, it occurred to me that...

204
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,926
I've never snuck through
your bedroom window.

205
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,595
Right, and now
that it's out of your system...

206
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,598
I was home watching television, and...

207
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:46,518
<i>The Exorcist</i> was on.
Got me thinking of you.

208
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:49,062
It did?

209
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:51,606
Yeah. It was edited for TV.

210
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,990
You know, all the good stuff
was cut out and

211
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:56,362
it got me thinking of us.

212
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,574
How two years ago,
we started off hot and heavy.

213
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:04,995
Nice, solid R rating,
on our way to an NC-17.

214
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,959
And how things have changed, and...

215
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:18,467
Lately, we're just
sort of edited for television.

216
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,929
So, you thought
you would climb in my window,

217
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:25,473
and we'd have a little raw footage?

218
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,477
No, no. I wouldn't dream
of breaking your underwear rule.

219
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:32,188
I just...

220
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:35,472
I thought maybe we could do
a little on top of the clothes stuff.

221
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:39,446
Okay.

222
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:42,324
Yeah?

223
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,076
Yeah.

224
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,591
Hey.

225
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:18,110
Okay. Okay, okay. Time's up, stud bucket.

226
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,071
You see what you do to me?

227
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,748
You know what my dad will do to you?

228
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:26,952
Yeah.

229
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:30,039
- I'm going.
- Okay.

230
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:36,170
Bye.

231
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:42,092
You know,
I appreciate the romantic gesture.

232
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:47,848
Hey, about the sex stuff?

233
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,726
You know,
I'm not trying to rush you at all.

234
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,644
I was only half-serious.

235
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,731
Okay.

236
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:05,616
Hey, Billy.

237
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:09,953
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?

238
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:11,830
What's that?

239
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,590
My God. You're just a tease.

240
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:34,019
<i>35-14... Situation under control.</i>

241
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:37,314
<i>Roger, dispatch. 35, I copy.</i>

242
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:41,276
All right.

243
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,252
...are dealing drugs,
that they are high in the classrooms,

244
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:01,296
and that they are involved in the occult.

245
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,381
Occult?

246
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:07,177
The small town of Woodsboro, California
was devastated last night

247
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:10,055
when two young teenagers
were found brutally murdered.

248
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:13,641
Authorities have yet to issue a statement,
but our sources tell us

249
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,394
that no arrest has been made,
and the murderer could strike again...

250
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:19,314
- Do you believe this shit?
- Tatum, what is going on?

251
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,732
- You don't know?
- No.

252
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:24,527
Casey Becker and Steve Orth
were killed last night.

253
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:25,945
What? No way.

254
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:29,032
And we're not just talking killed,
we're talking splatter-movie killed,

255
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:31,284
ripped open from end to end.

256
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:33,870
Casey Becker?
She sits next to me in English.

257
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:35,080
Not anymore.

258
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:38,249
It's so sad. Her mom and dad
found her hanging from a tree,

259
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,626
her insides on the outside.

260
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,671
Oh, my God. Do they know who did it?

261
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,382
Fucking clueless. I mean,
they're interrogating the entire school,

262
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:47,801
teachers, students, janitors.

263
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:50,220
- They think it's school-related?
- They don't know.

264
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:54,354
Dewey was saying this is the worst crime
they've seen in years, even worse than...

265
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:56,226
Well...

266
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,061
It's bad.

267
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,867
- Here you go, Mrs. Taylor.
- Thank you, Jimmy.

268
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,282
Sidney?

269
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:13,994
It would appear to be your turn.

270
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,957
Who's up next?

271
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,491
- Sidney Prescott.
- Prescott.

272
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:22,961
She was daughter of...

273
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:28,049
- Sidney. Thank you.
- Okay.

274
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,218
Hi, Sidney.

275
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:31,887
Sheriff Burke. Dewey.

276
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:34,848
That's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

277
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,017
How is everything?

278
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:39,102
Good.

279
00:19:39,186 --> 00:19:41,271
And your dad? How's he doing?

280
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:43,189
We're fine, thanks.

281
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:45,323
We're gonna keep this very brief, Sidney.

282
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:48,526
The police just wanna ask you
a few questions. You okay?

283
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,282
Sidney, were you very close
to Casey Becker?

284
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:56,369
<i>Remember, your principal loves you,
and I want you to be safe.</i>

285
00:19:56,453 --> 00:20:00,123
<i>All students are encouraged to return to
their homes promptly from school grounds.</i>

286
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:02,041
<i>Avoid strangers
and walk in twos and threes...</i>

287
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,336
- How many questions did they ask you, Sid?
- Well, they asked me if I knew Casey.

288
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,214
- Yeah, they asked me that, too.
- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?

289
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:09,925
Yeah, they did. They ask you?

290
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:13,094
Hunt? Why would they ask you
if you like to hunt?

291
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,828
Because their bodies were gutted.

292
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:17,265
Thank you, Randy.

293
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,892
They didn't ask me if I liked to hunt.

294
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:21,019
That's 'cause there's no way
a girl could've killed them.

295
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:22,103
That is so sexist.

296
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,731
The killer could easily be female.
<i>Basic Instinct?</i>

297
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:27,150
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.

298
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:29,777
Yeah, Casey and Steve
were completely hollowed out.

299
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,906
And the fact is, it takes a man
to do something like that.

300
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,365
Or a man's mentality.

301
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:36,910
How do you gut someone?

302
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:41,957
You take a knife,

303
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,668
and you slit them from groin to sternum.

304
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:48,422
Hey, it's called tact, you fuckrag.

305
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,550
Hey, Stu, didn't you used to date Casey?

306
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,801
Yeah, for, like, two seconds.

307
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,803
Before she dumped him for Steve.

308
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,473
- I thought you dumped her for me?
- I did. He's full of shit.

309
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,857
Are the police aware
that you dated the victim?

310
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:03,561
Hey, what are you saying?
That I killed her?

311
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:05,605
It would certainly improve
your high school "Q."

312
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:08,316
Stu was with me last night. Okay?

313
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,526
Yeah, I was.

314
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,154
Was that before or after
he sliced and diced?

315
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,281
Fuck you, nutcase.
Where were you last night?

316
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:16,824
Working, thank you.

317
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,202
At the video store?
I thought they fired your sorry ass.

318
00:21:19,286 --> 00:21:20,370
Twice.

319
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:23,498
I didn't kill anybody.

320
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,167
Nobody said you did.

321
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:26,918
Thanks, buddy.

322
00:21:27,544 --> 00:21:32,048
Besides, it takes a man
to do something like that.

323
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:34,509
Yo, I'm gonna gut your ass
in a second, kid.

324
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,720
Tell me something, did you really put
her liver in the mailbox?

325
00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:40,014
'Cause I heard that they found her liver
in the mailbox

326
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,683
next to her spleen and her pancreas.

327
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,310
Randy, you goon-fuck,
I'm trying to eat here.

328
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:45,937
She's getting mad, Randy.

329
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,981
You better "liver" alone.

330
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,319
Liver alone!

331
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,035
Liver, liver! Live? It was a joke.

332
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,166
See you, Sidney.

333
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,800
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.

334
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,550
So you sure I can stay over?
'Cause my dad won't be back till Sunday.

335
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:38,121
<i>No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.</i>

336
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,951
<i>You okay?</i>

337
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:45,788
It's just, you know,
the police and reporters and everything,

338
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:48,082
it's like déjà vu all over again.

339
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,543
<i>I'll be there by 7.-00, I promise.</i>

340
00:22:50,627 --> 00:22:52,462
- Thanks, Tatum.
<i>- Later.</i>

341
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:44,555
<i>...the bodies of 17.-year-old Casey Becker
and her 18-year-old boyfriend Steven Orth</i>

342
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:46,682
<i>were discovered late last night
by the girl's...</i>

343
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:48,684
<i>The Woodsboro double-murder case.</i>

344
00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:51,818
<i>Authorities are baffled
by the lack of clues and the savage...</i>

345
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:55,900
<i>The town's in shock, and no one
can quite believe what has happened here.</i>

346
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:58,945
<i>Although this is not the first time
this small community of Woodsboro</i>

347
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:00,863
<i>has endured such tragedy.</i>

348
00:24:00,947 --> 00:24:03,866
<i>Only a year ago, Maureen Prescott,
wife and mother,</i>

349
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,704
<i>was found raped and murdered
not far from this peaceful town square.</i>

350
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:19,650
Hello?

351
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:21,778
<i>Practice ran late. I'm on my way, okay?</i>

352
00:25:24,447 --> 00:25:25,948
It's past 7:00.

353
00:25:26,032 --> 00:25:29,282
<i>Don't worry. Casey and Steve
didn't bite it till way after 10.:00.</i>

354
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:31,996
That's comforting.

355
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,789
<i>I'm gonna swing by the video store.</i>

356
00:25:33,873 --> 00:25:35,958
<i>I was thinking Tom Cruise
in</i> All the Right Moves.

357
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:38,753
<i>You know, if you pause it just right,
you can see his penis.</i>

358
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,671
Whatever. Just hurry, okay?

359
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:41,965
<i>Ta-ta, Sid.</i>

360
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,310
Tatum, just get in the car...

361
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:55,520
<i>Hello, Sidney.</i>

362
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,900
Hi. Who is this?

363
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:02,110
<i>You tell me.</i>

364
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,281
Well, I have no idea.

365
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,033
<i>Scary night, isn't it?</i>

366
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:13,371
<i>With the murders and all, it's like
right out of a horror movie or something.</i>

367
00:26:14,914 --> 00:26:16,415
Randy, you gave yourself away.

368
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:19,085
Are you calling from work?
'Cause Tatum's on her way over.

369
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:22,171
<i>Do you like scary movies, Sidney?</i>

370
00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:24,423
I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy.

371
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:25,800
It's sexy.

372
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,386
<i>What's your favorite scary movie?</i>

373
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,304
Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.

374
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,348
<i>Why not? Too scared?</i>

375
00:26:32,432 --> 00:26:35,309
No. No. It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.

376
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,312
Some stupid killer stalking some
big-breasted girl who can't act,

377
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,647
who's always running up the stairs

378
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,316
when she should be going out
the front door. It's insulting.

379
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,361
<i>Are you alone in the house?</i>

380
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:48,281
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.

381
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:51,534
<i>Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.</i>

382
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:00,710
So, who are you?

383
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:06,132
<i>The question isn't, "Who am I?"
The question is, "Where am I?"</i>

384
00:27:07,884 --> 00:27:10,303
So, where are you?

385
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:12,138
<i>Your front porch.</i>

386
00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:19,145
Why would you be calling
from my front porch?

387
00:27:19,229 --> 00:27:21,147
<i>That's the original part.</i>

388
00:27:23,316 --> 00:27:24,359
Oh, yeah?

389
00:27:28,655 --> 00:27:29,864
Well, I call your bluff.

390
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:44,587
So where are you?

391
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:46,005
<i>Right here.</i>

392
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:20,373
Can you see me right now?

393
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,294
Okay. What am I doing?

394
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,507
What am I doing? Hello?

395
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:32,968
Nice try, Randy.

396
00:28:33,052 --> 00:28:35,304
Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay? Bye, now.

397
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:38,138
<i>If you hang up on me,
you'll die, just like your mother!</i>

398
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:42,520
<i>Do you want to die, Sidney?</i>

399
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:44,856
<i>Your mother sure didn't.</i>

400
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,901
Fuck you, you cretin.

401
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:19,057
No!

402
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:46,960
Come on.

403
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,129
Shit!

404
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:07,813
Billy!

405
00:30:07,897 --> 00:30:10,065
Door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?

406
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:12,193
The killer's here. He's in the house.

407
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:15,029
No, he's in the house.
He's gonna... He's gonna kill us.

408
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,406
He's gone.

409
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:18,074
He's gone.

410
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:19,701
It's all right.

411
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:31,629
What?

412
00:30:35,758 --> 00:30:36,759
Sid, what?

413
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:41,096
Wait, wait, wait!

414
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,057
Sidney, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

415
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,476
Come on! Sidney, come back!

416
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,270
Sidney!

417
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:54,485
Sorry. I found this.

418
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,654
Come on!

419
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:58,072
All right, hold your hands together!

420
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,324
Do you wish to give up
your right to remain silent?

421
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:01,534
I didn't do anything.

422
00:31:01,618 --> 00:31:03,869
Do you wish to give up
your right to speak to an attorney

423
00:31:03,953 --> 00:31:05,663
and have him present during questioning?

424
00:31:05,747 --> 00:31:07,040
Ask her. She'll tell you.

425
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,834
- Ask her.
- What have you got, Dewey?

426
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:11,085
- I caught him, Sheriff.
- Wait!

427
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,837
- Who is that?
- Billy Loomis.

428
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:16,132
Sir... Sheriff, call these guys off.
I didn't do it.

429
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:20,636
Sheriff, wait, wait. Listen. Call my dad.

430
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,389
Please call him.
He'll tell you. Just call him.

431
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:26,433
Sidney! Sidney!

432
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,967
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.

433
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:31,480
You'd have to be,
all the shit she's been through.

434
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:32,941
Sid!

435
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:35,735
Well, we're seeing a lot of you today.

436
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:39,530
You gonna be able to come to the station
and answer a few questions, Sid?

437
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:40,948
Oh, shit. Sidney!

438
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,117
God, Sid, I'm so sorry I was late.
Are you all right?

439
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,369
Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.

440
00:31:45,453 --> 00:31:46,620
It's okay.

441
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,665
Her dad's out of town, all right?
She's staying with us tonight.

442
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:52,251
- Does Mom know?
- Yes, doofus.

443
00:31:52,335 --> 00:31:54,585
- Let's get you out of here.
- She'll be okay.

444
00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:57,339
- Come on, Sid.
- You won't believe this.

445
00:31:57,423 --> 00:31:58,466
What?

446
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:02,679
Creepy, huh?

447
00:32:12,105 --> 00:32:13,355
- I'll be damned.
- What?

448
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:15,149
Jesus, the camera! Hurry!

449
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,776
My name isn't Jesus.

450
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:20,696
Sidney, is that you in there?

451
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,740
Excuse me, is that Sidney Prescott
they took away?

452
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:23,991
I'm not talking to you.

453
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,160
- What happened to her?
- None of your damn business.

454
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,704
I heard something about a costume.
Is that true?

455
00:32:28,788 --> 00:32:30,497
Can you tell me anything?

456
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:34,002
Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.
Leave Sid alone.

457
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:36,170
Where's she going?

458
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:40,633
- Look... Kenny?
- Yeah?

459
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:43,344
I know that you're about
50 pounds overweight,

460
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,137
but when I say hurry,

461
00:32:45,221 --> 00:32:49,767
please interpret that as
move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!

462
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,522
Did you find him?

463
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:57,524
You're sure it was the Hilton?

464
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,068
At the airport.

465
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:02,530
He's not registered there.

466
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:06,207
Could he have stayed somewhere else?

467
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,162
I don't know. I guess.

468
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,457
Don't worry, Sid.

469
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:14,291
We'll find him.

470
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,825
Dewey, they got that mask in.

471
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:19,088
- Roger, dispatch.
- I'll be right back.

472
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,931
Let me ask you this,

473
00:33:29,015 --> 00:33:31,465
what are you doing
with a cellular telephone, Son?

474
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:33,853
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.

475
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:36,897
I didn't make those calls. I swear.

476
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:40,025
Why don't you check the phone bill,
for Christ's sake. Call Vital Phone Comp.

477
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:43,959
- They got records of every number dialed.
- Thanks, Hank. We're on top of it.

478
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,489
What were you doing over
at Sidney's house tonight?

479
00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:49,785
I wanted to see her, that's all.

480
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:53,622
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night, too.

481
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:55,041
You went out last night?

482
00:33:56,918 --> 00:34:00,671
I was watching TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.

483
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:02,548
You happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?

484
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:05,384
No. No, I didn't.

485
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,678
Sheriff, I didn't kill anybody.

486
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:16,317
We're gonna have to hold you, Son,
till we get those phone records.

487
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,566
This is crazy.

488
00:34:22,235 --> 00:34:24,654
You know that? I didn't do it.

489
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:37,458
- Camera two!
- No, I do!

490
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,625
- Okay!
- Yeah.

491
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,459
Are there any more donuts in there?

492
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:42,296
Move it, Kenny.

493
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,130
- They're not letting anybody in.
- I'm not just anyone.

494
00:34:45,508 --> 00:34:46,508
Bitch goddess.

495
00:34:46,592 --> 00:34:48,260
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.

496
00:34:48,344 --> 00:34:51,180
Hi. Gale Weathers reporting live
from the Woodsboro Police Station,

497
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,515
where we hope to get a glimpse
of Sidney Prescott.

498
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,683
Hey, watch her, Larry!

499
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:57,102
Hey, watch the hand.
You know who you're dealing with here?

500
00:34:57,186 --> 00:35:00,189
Tell them. Come on, Dad. Tell them.

501
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:02,566
- Sidney...
- Just wait for the lawyer, Billy.

502
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,902
- Sidney, come on. You know me.
- Come on, come on.

503
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:07,436
- Sidney, look at me!
- Don't give us any trouble.

504
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:08,823
Come on!

505
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,332
Sid, I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?
You okay?

506
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:23,837
They sell this costume
in every five-and-dime in the state.

507
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,965
There's no way to track the purchase.

508
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,926
What about that cellular phone bill?

509
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,095
Well, we're pulling Loomis's account.

510
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:33,180
We won't know anything until the morning.

511
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,348
Oh, come on!

512
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:37,351
You think he did it?

513
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,437
Twenty years ago,
I would've said not a chance.

514
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:42,273
But these kids today

515
00:35:43,816 --> 00:35:44,900
damned if I know.

516
00:35:44,984 --> 00:35:46,735
Hey, Dewey, can we go now?

517
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:48,195
Hold on a second.

518
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,947
Goddamn it, Dewey!

519
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:51,907
What did Mom tell you?

520
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:54,326
When I wear this badge,
you treat me like a man of the law.

521
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:58,122
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey boy,
but we're ready to go. Now, okay?

522
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,874
Take them out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.

523
00:36:03,336 --> 00:36:04,461
Go on, big brother.

524
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:06,130
- Come on.
- Don't touch me.

525
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:08,048
He's my superior.

526
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,884
The janitor's your superior.

527
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,513
Let's get back to work!

528
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,688
Isn't there a back way out of this place?

529
00:36:22,772 --> 00:36:24,690
Yeah. Down that alley, I think.

530
00:36:29,111 --> 00:36:31,029
You guys just stay here.
I'm gonna get the car.

531
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:32,663
Don't move. Don't make a sound.

532
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:37,119
There she is. Sidney!

533
00:36:38,454 --> 00:36:41,373
Hi. Some night. What happened?
Are you all right?

534
00:36:41,457 --> 00:36:43,500
She's not answering any questions.
Leave us alone.

535
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:46,336
No. No, Tatum. It's okay.
She's just doing her job, right, Gale?

536
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,047
Yes, that's right.

537
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,840
So how's the book?

538
00:36:50,424 --> 00:36:52,174
Well, it'll be out later this year.

539
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:54,261
I'll look for it.

540
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,888
I'll send you a copy.

541
00:36:58,057 --> 00:36:59,058
Geez.

542
00:37:00,643 --> 00:37:02,060
- Nice shot.
- Bitch.

543
00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:05,814
- No, I mean, the camera. Nice shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?

544
00:37:05,898 --> 00:37:10,069
God, I loved it. "I'll send you a copy."
Bam! Bitch went down.

545
00:37:10,778 --> 00:37:16,241
"I'll send you a copy." Bam!
Sid, superbitch! You are so cool.

546
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:18,875
Thought you might want some ice
for that right hook.

547
00:37:19,495 --> 00:37:20,496
Thanks.

548
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:24,416
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.

549
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,626
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:37:31,841 --> 00:37:33,509
Do you really think Billy did it?

551
00:37:35,094 --> 00:37:36,262
He was there, Tatum.

552
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:41,350
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.

553
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:44,811
Telephone, honey.

554
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,605
- Who is it?
- It's for Sid.

555
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:47,690
My dad?

556
00:37:48,274 --> 00:37:49,733
I don't think so.

557
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:52,528
- Take a message.
- No. I'll get it.

558
00:37:56,866 --> 00:37:58,075
How's she doing?

559
00:38:01,954 --> 00:38:02,996
Hello?

560
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,124
<i>Hello, Sidney.</i>

561
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:07,584
No!

562
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:09,711
<i>Poor Billy boyfriend.</i>

563
00:38:09,795 --> 00:38:12,381
<i>An innocent guy
doesn't stand a chance with you.</i>

564
00:38:12,465 --> 00:38:13,715
Leave me alone!

565
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:15,968
<i>Looks like you fingered the wrong guy...</i>

566
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:17,177
- Dewey!
<i>- ...again.</i>

567
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,637
- Who are you?
- Dewey!

568
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:22,474
- Hang up, Sid.
<i>- Don't worry. You'll find out soon enough.</i>

569
00:38:22,558 --> 00:38:24,143
<i>- I promise.</i>
- Dewey!

570
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,147
What?

571
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:32,735
- "What?"
- What?

572
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:39,700
Hello?

573
00:38:50,878 --> 00:38:54,756
<i>Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night,</i>

574
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,385
<i>is the daughter of Maureen Prescott,
who was brutally killed last year</i>

575
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,305
<i>when convicted murderer Cotton Weary
broke into their home</i>

576
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:03,724
<i>and savagely raped and tortured
the deceased.</i>

577
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:07,811
<i>Cotton Weary is currently awaiting appeal
for the death sentence handed down</i>

578
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:10,522
<i>after the young Sidney
testified against him.</i>

579
00:39:10,606 --> 00:39:13,456
<i>She was the key witness
in the state's case against the...</i>

580
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:18,114
It's never gonna stop, is it?

581
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,908
Billy was released.

582
00:39:22,118 --> 00:39:25,537
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.

583
00:39:25,621 --> 00:39:28,415
We're checking every cellular account
in the county.

584
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:32,002
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.

585
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:35,297
It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.

586
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:38,092
Okay?

587
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:57,609
Don't worry, Sid. It's school.
You'll be safe here.

588
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,905
How does it feel
to be almost brutally butchered?

589
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:01,323
Hey! Hey, now, leave her alone.

590
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:03,283
People want to know!
They have a right to know!

591
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,035
- Leave her alone.
- How does it feel?

592
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,913
She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.

593
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:10,833
What?

594
00:40:13,127 --> 00:40:14,128
Just a sec.

595
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:26,431
Stop right there.

596
00:40:26,515 --> 00:40:28,809
I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.

597
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,685
Kenny, camera, now.

598
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,521
- Off the record. No cameras.
- Forget it.

599
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:34,648
Please? You owe me.

600
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:35,941
I owe you shit.

601
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:37,193
You owe my mother!

602
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,948
Your mother's murder
was last year's hottest court case.

603
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:44,658
Somebody was gonna write a book about it.

604
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,077
Right. It had to be you
with your lies and bullshit theories.

605
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:49,955
What is your problem?
You got what you wanted.

606
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:52,582
Cotton Weary's in jail.
They're gonna gas him.

607
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,266
A book is not gonna change that.

608
00:40:58,297 --> 00:41:00,799
- Do you still think he's innocent?
- Your testimony put him away.

609
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:02,783
It doesn't really matter what I think.

610
00:41:02,968 --> 00:41:06,430
During the trial, you did all those
stories about me. You called me a liar.

611
00:41:06,514 --> 00:41:08,682
I think you falsely identified him, yes.

612
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,852
- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.

613
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,397
- And has his story changed?
- Not one word.

614
00:41:16,232 --> 00:41:18,942
He admits to having sex with your mother,
but that's all.

615
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:21,528
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.

616
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,405
He raped her, and then

617
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,700
he butchered her.
Her blood was all over his coat.

618
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,077
He was drunk that night.

619
00:41:28,702 --> 00:41:31,496
He left his coat at your house
after your mother seduced him.

620
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,081
I saw him leave wearing it.

621
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:35,751
No, you saw someone leave
wearing that coat,

622
00:41:36,585 --> 00:41:40,130
the same someone who planted it
in Cotton's car, framing him.

623
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,551
No.

624
00:41:44,426 --> 00:41:45,970
Cotton murdered my mother.

625
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:50,522
You're not so sure anymore, are you?

626
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:55,062
Nice welt, sweetie. Let's go, Sid.

627
00:41:55,854 --> 00:41:57,731
The killer's still on the loose, isn't he?

628
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:58,857
Come on, Sid.

629
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:00,241
Those murders are related.

630
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,111
I'm sorry I mangled your face.

631
00:42:03,195 --> 00:42:04,362
Wait. Sidney, don't go.

632
00:42:04,446 --> 00:42:06,282
Just stop, all right?

633
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:13,747
Jesus Christ.

634
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,791
An innocent man on death row.
A killer still on the loose.

635
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,001
Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.

636
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:19,836
- You want to go live?
- No, no. Not so fast.

637
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,173
- We don't have anything concrete.
- This is huge. You can't just sit on it.

638
00:42:23,257 --> 00:42:25,801
I know. That's why we need proof.

639
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,388
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.

640
00:42:30,556 --> 00:42:32,956
Do you know what that
could do for my book sales?

641
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:36,437
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.

642
00:42:37,646 --> 00:42:40,396
I want you to meet me
right here after class. Okay, Sid?

643
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,234
All right.

644
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:47,906
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?

645
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:50,367
You mean after you branded him
the Candy Man?

646
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:52,161
- No. His heart's broken.
- Stu!

647
00:43:01,837 --> 00:43:03,255
Why are they doing this?

648
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:06,967
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.

649
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,761
- Stupidity leak!
- Easy!

650
00:43:09,845 --> 00:43:10,929
Sidney!

651
00:43:13,182 --> 00:43:14,308
Jesus! Shit!

652
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:16,310
It's just me.

653
00:43:19,772 --> 00:43:21,147
You still think it's me.

654
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,650
No. No, I don't.

655
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:26,528
It's just... somebody was there...

656
00:43:26,612 --> 00:43:27,737
Hey, Christie, wait up.

657
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:29,239
Billy, someone tried to kill me.

658
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:31,700
I know. I know.
The cops said I scared them away.

659
00:43:31,784 --> 00:43:33,243
It wasn't me, Sid.

660
00:43:34,328 --> 00:43:37,706
I know. He called me again last night
at Tatum's house.

661
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:41,543
You see? Couldn't have been me.
I was in jail. Remember?

662
00:43:44,546 --> 00:43:47,466
I'm so... sorry. Please understand.

663
00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:49,385
Understand what?

664
00:43:50,052 --> 00:43:52,178
That I have a girlfriend
who would rather accuse me

665
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,807
of being a psychopathic killer
than touch me?

666
00:43:56,892 --> 00:43:58,018
You know that's not true.

667
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,144
Then what is it?

668
00:43:59,228 --> 00:44:01,229
What... is it?

669
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:03,732
Billy, I was attacked
and nearly filleted last night.

670
00:44:03,816 --> 00:44:05,025
I mean between us.

671
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:08,043
I mean, you haven't been the same since...

672
00:44:10,656 --> 00:44:11,656
since your mother died.

673
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:15,452
Is your brain leaking? My mom was killed.
I can't believe you're bringing this up!

674
00:44:15,536 --> 00:44:16,870
No, it's been a year.

675
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,205
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.

676
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,249
I know. I think it's time
you got over that.

677
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:24,252
I mean, when my mom left my dad,
I accepted it.

678
00:44:24,336 --> 00:44:27,088
It's the way it is. She's not coming back.

679
00:44:27,172 --> 00:44:30,342
Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.

680
00:44:30,426 --> 00:44:32,802
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.

681
00:44:32,886 --> 00:44:36,390
Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.
It's... it's a bad analogy.

682
00:44:37,558 --> 00:44:38,726
It's just that...

683
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,812
I want my girlfriend back.

684
00:44:44,898 --> 00:44:46,024
Sid!

685
00:44:46,108 --> 00:44:47,984
I am sorry if my traumatized life

686
00:44:48,068 --> 00:44:51,029
is an inconvenience to you
and your perfect existence.

687
00:44:51,113 --> 00:44:54,283
What? What are you...
Nobody said that! Sid!

688
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,952
Stupid.

689
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:00,288
You make me so sick.

690
00:45:00,372 --> 00:45:04,835
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving,
whoring generation disgusts me.

691
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:11,508
So, two of your fellow students
were just savagely murdered,

692
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:14,302
and this is the way that you show
your compassion and sensitivity, huh?

693
00:45:14,386 --> 00:45:15,786
Let me tell you something...

694
00:45:16,764 --> 00:45:18,264
You're both expelled. Get out!

695
00:45:19,308 --> 00:45:22,308
- Come on, Mr. Himbry! It was just a joke!
- That's not fair!

696
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:29,401
You're absolutely right. It is not fair.

697
00:45:29,485 --> 00:45:34,030
Fairness would be to rip your insides out,
hang you from a tree so we can expose you

698
00:45:34,114 --> 00:45:37,075
for the heartless,
desensitized little shits that you are.

699
00:45:49,463 --> 00:45:52,090
She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.

700
00:45:52,174 --> 00:45:53,425
Why would she lie about it?

701
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:56,136
For attention.
The girl has some serious issues.

702
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,978
What if she did it?

703
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,355
What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?

704
00:46:07,439 --> 00:46:09,190
And why would she do that?

705
00:46:09,274 --> 00:46:12,819
Maybe she had the hots for Steve
and killed them both in a jealous rage.

706
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,029
What would Sidney want with Steve?

707
00:46:15,113 --> 00:46:17,741
She has her own
bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.

708
00:46:18,534 --> 00:46:21,202
Maybe she's a slut just like her mother.

709
00:46:21,286 --> 00:46:24,831
- You're evil.
- Please. It's a common fact.

710
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,332
Her mother was a tramp.

711
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,418
Cut some slack.
She watched her mom get butchered.

712
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:30,879
Yeah, and it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.

713
00:46:30,963 --> 00:46:33,548
Her mother's death
leaves her disturbed and hostile

714
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:35,967
in a cruel and inhumane world.

715
00:46:36,051 --> 00:46:40,180
She's delusional. "Where's God?"
Et cetera. Completely suicidal.

716
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:43,224
One day, she snaps.
She wants to kill herself,

717
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:46,478
but she realizes that teen suicide
is out this year,

718
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:50,565
and homicide is a much healthier,
therapeutic expression.

719
00:46:50,649 --> 00:46:52,484
Where do you get this shit?

720
00:46:52,568 --> 00:46:53,569
Ricki Lake.

721
00:46:54,403 --> 00:46:56,280
You are pathetic!

722
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:10,919
"Pathetic."

723
00:47:12,754 --> 00:47:14,756
<i>Sidney.</i>

724
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,408
<i>Sidney.</i>

725
00:47:46,914 --> 00:47:47,956
Is someone there?

726
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:29,914
<i>In what appears to be a prank,</i>

727
00:48:29,998 --> 00:48:32,458
<i>several students were seen
wearing scary masks.</i>

728
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,294
<i>School officials have yet to comment,</i>

729
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:38,506
but this is known to be the same costume
worn by the killer.

730
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:41,342
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker
and her boyfriend Steven Orth

731
00:48:41,426 --> 00:48:44,429
have already lost their lives. Who's next?

732
00:48:44,513 --> 00:48:48,474
<i>You can literally feel
the fear on this campus.</i>

733
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:51,895
Hi. Gale Weathers,
field correspondent, <i>Top Story.</i>

734
00:48:51,979 --> 00:48:55,231
I know who you are, Miss Weathers.
How's the eye?

735
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:57,942
It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?

736
00:48:58,026 --> 00:49:00,153
No. Everything's under control.

737
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,738
Well, of course. You're here.

738
00:49:02,364 --> 00:49:03,656
You're not supposed to be here.

739
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,451
I know. I should be in New York
covering the Sharon Stone stalker,

740
00:49:06,535 --> 00:49:07,869
but who knew?

741
00:49:09,204 --> 00:49:11,454
You look awfully young
to be a police officer.

742
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm 25 years old.

743
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,585
You know, in a demographic study,

744
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:18,880
I proved to be most popular
amongst males 11 to 24.

745
00:49:19,715 --> 00:49:20,915
Guess I just missed you.

746
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:24,010
Of course, you don't look a day over 12,

747
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,888
except in that upper-torso area.

748
00:49:26,972 --> 00:49:29,622
- Does the force require you to work out?
- No, ma'am.

749
00:49:30,642 --> 00:49:32,143
'Cause of my boyish good looks,

750
00:49:32,227 --> 00:49:35,689
muscle mass has increased my acceptance
as a serious police officer.

751
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:38,399
<i>I need your attention now, kids.</i>

752
00:49:38,483 --> 00:49:40,526
<i>Due to the recent events
that have occurred,</i>

753
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:44,614
<i>effective immediately, all classes
are suspended until further notice.</i>

754
00:49:45,907 --> 00:49:49,327
<i>The Woodsboro Police Department
has issued a citywide curfew</i>

755
00:49:49,411 --> 00:49:52,164
<i>beginning at nine o'clock tonight.</i>

756
00:49:53,165 --> 00:49:55,166
Looks like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

757
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,502
Well, a serial killer
is not really accurate.

758
00:49:57,586 --> 00:50:00,004
Gotta knock off a couple more
to get that title.

759
00:50:00,088 --> 00:50:01,506
Well, we can help, can't we?

760
00:50:03,216 --> 00:50:05,468
I mean, we certainly don't have any leads.

761
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:07,512
Have you located Sidney's father yet?

762
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:09,472
No, not yet.

763
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:11,140
Well, he's not a suspect, is he?

764
00:50:11,224 --> 00:50:13,602
We haven't ruled him out as a possibility.

765
00:50:14,936 --> 00:50:17,689
- If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?

766
00:50:18,523 --> 00:50:20,317
If I may say so, Miss Weathers...

767
00:50:22,694 --> 00:50:24,446
you are much prettier in person.

768
00:50:26,448 --> 00:50:28,116
So you do watch the show.

769
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:33,830
I'm 25. I was 24 for a whole year.

770
00:50:35,457 --> 00:50:36,917
Please, call me Gale.

771
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,670
It was just some sick fuck
having a laugh, Sidney.

772
00:50:40,754 --> 00:50:43,006
No, it was him, Tatum. I know it.

773
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:47,176
You're not to be alone anymore, right?
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?

774
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,679
Kizool, 'cause schizzool is izzout.

775
00:50:49,763 --> 00:50:52,807
I don't know what you did, Sidney,
but on behalf of the entire student body,

776
00:50:52,891 --> 00:50:55,184
- we all say thank you!
- Stop it, Stu.

777
00:50:55,268 --> 00:50:59,272
No, I say impromptu party tonight,
my house,

778
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,315
to celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?

779
00:51:01,399 --> 00:51:02,526
Are you serious?

780
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,610
Parents are out of town,

781
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,822
and if this little vixen doesn't invite
the entire world, we'll be fine.

782
00:51:07,906 --> 00:51:10,158
Intimate gathering, intimate friends.

783
00:51:10,242 --> 00:51:13,870
What do you say, Sid?
I mean, pathos could have its perks.

784
00:51:13,954 --> 00:51:16,497
Totally protected. Yo, I am so buff.

785
00:51:16,581 --> 00:51:18,500
- I got you covered, girl.
- No...

786
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:20,918
Come on, Sid.

787
00:51:21,002 --> 00:51:22,712
For me? It could be fun.

788
00:51:24,339 --> 00:51:25,715
Okay, whatever.

789
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:27,425
Yeah? Nice.

790
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:29,901
Cool. You guys bring food, all right?

791
00:51:47,946 --> 00:51:49,114
Yes?

792
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:51,199
Hello?

793
00:52:07,507 --> 00:52:08,508
Damn it.

794
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,029
- Damn little shits.
- What'd you call me?

795
00:52:30,572 --> 00:52:32,490
- Not you, Fred.
- Prick.

796
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,940
What if Cotton Weary is telling the truth?

797
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:51,527
Maybe he was having an affair
with your mom.

798
00:53:51,611 --> 00:53:54,611
I mean, your dad was always
out of town on business. Maybe

799
00:53:56,449 --> 00:53:58,826
maybe your mom
was just a very unhappy woman.

800
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:00,745
If they were having an affair,

801
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:03,179
then how come
Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

802
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:07,793
Well, you can't prove a rumor.
That's why it's a rumor.

803
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:11,923
Right, created by
that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.

804
00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:15,302
It goes further back, Sid.

805
00:54:17,137 --> 00:54:18,847
There's been talk about other men.

806
00:54:19,431 --> 00:54:20,557
And you believe it?

807
00:54:22,017 --> 00:54:23,018
Well...

808
00:54:24,185 --> 00:54:26,395
I mean, you can only hear
that Richard Gere gerbil story

809
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:29,441
so many times
before you have to start believing it.

810
00:54:35,155 --> 00:54:36,197
I'm sorry.

811
00:54:39,534 --> 00:54:41,661
You know, if I was wrong
about Cotton Weary,

812
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:44,121
then the killer's still out there.

813
00:54:44,205 --> 00:54:45,289
Don't go there, Sid.

814
00:54:45,373 --> 00:54:48,334
You're starting to sound like
some Wes Carpenter flick or something.

815
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:51,718
Don't freak yourself out, okay?
We've got a long night ahead of us.

816
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,089
Okay?

817
00:54:54,716 --> 00:54:55,759
Let's boogie.

818
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:01,890
<i>It's alive!</i>

819
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,392
<i>In the name of God!</i>

820
00:55:09,731 --> 00:55:11,191
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.

821
00:55:15,904 --> 00:55:16,905
Dork.

822
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:20,658
Jesus, this place is packed tonight, man.

823
00:55:21,326 --> 00:55:23,119
We had a run in the mass murder section.

824
00:55:23,203 --> 00:55:24,620
Coming to my fiesta?

825
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:27,498
- Yeah, I'm off early. Curfew, you know?
- Cool.

826
00:55:27,582 --> 00:55:30,167
What's that werewolf movie
with ET's mom in it?

827
00:55:30,251 --> 00:55:31,877
<i>The Howling.</i> Horror, straight ahead.

828
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,296
Okay, thanks.

829
00:55:35,173 --> 00:55:37,133
Oh, now, that's in poor taste.

830
00:55:37,217 --> 00:55:38,510
What?

831
00:55:39,344 --> 00:55:41,994
If you were the only suspect
in a senseless bloodbath,

832
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,980
would you being standing
in the horror section?

833
00:55:45,183 --> 00:55:47,685
Well, it was just a misunderstanding.

834
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,478
He didn't do anything.

835
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:51,439
You're such a little lap dog.

836
00:55:51,523 --> 00:55:53,649
He's got "killer"
printed all over his forehead.

837
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:56,402
Okay, really?

838
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,779
Why'd the cops let him go, smart guy?

839
00:55:58,863 --> 00:56:00,906
Because obviously
they don't watch enough movies.

840
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,950
This is standard horror movie stuff.

841
00:56:03,034 --> 00:56:04,577
<i>Prom Night</i> revisited, man.

842
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:07,663
Yeah? Why would he want to kill
his own girlfriend?

843
00:56:07,747 --> 00:56:11,047
There's always some stupid bullshit reason
to kill your girlfriend.

844
00:56:11,584 --> 00:56:14,003
That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity.

845
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:18,174
Besides, if it gets too complicated,
you'll lose your target audience.

846
00:56:18,258 --> 00:56:20,301
Well, what's his reason?

847
00:56:21,052 --> 00:56:23,052
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.

848
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:25,848
What, is she saving herself for you?

849
00:56:25,932 --> 00:56:28,182
Maybe. Now that Billy
tried to mutilate her

850
00:56:28,893 --> 00:56:30,793
do you think Sid would go out with me?

851
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,028
No, I don't, at all. No.

852
00:56:39,612 --> 00:56:40,762
Know who I think it is?

853
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,399
You know, I think it's her father.

854
00:56:45,243 --> 00:56:47,453
Why can't they find her pops, man?

855
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,831
Because he's probably dead.

856
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:53,459
His body will come popping up
in the last reel somewhere,

857
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:56,754
eyes gouged out, fingers cut off,
teeth knocked out!

858
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,882
See, the police are always
off track with this shit.

859
00:56:59,966 --> 00:57:01,967
If they watched <i>Prom Night,</i>
they'd save time.

860
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:05,262
There's a formula to it,
a very simple formula!

861
00:57:05,346 --> 00:57:06,806
Everybody's a suspect!

862
00:57:12,854 --> 00:57:15,454
I'm telling you, the dad's a red herring.
It's Billy.

863
00:57:17,108 --> 00:57:18,958
How do we know you're not the killer?

864
00:57:21,654 --> 00:57:22,655
Hi, Billy.

865
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,990
Maybe your movie-freaked mind
lost its reality button.

866
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,075
Ever think of that?

867
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:28,369
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.

868
00:57:28,453 --> 00:57:30,913
If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.

869
00:57:30,997 --> 00:57:31,997
That's right.

870
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,875
And what would be your motive?

871
00:57:34,834 --> 00:57:36,002
It's the millennium.

872
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:38,838
Motives are incidental.

873
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,006
Millennium?

874
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:42,466
Millennium, I like that.

875
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:45,261
That's good. "It's the millennium."

876
00:57:46,471 --> 00:57:47,555
Good kid.

877
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,976
"Millennium." Good word, my man.

878
00:57:52,644 --> 00:57:54,744
Now, you're telling me
that's not a killer?

879
00:58:39,566 --> 00:58:40,733
Sure is quiet.

880
00:58:42,735 --> 00:58:46,071
God, look at this place.
It's <i>The Town That Dreaded Sundown.</i>

881
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:49,200
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?

882
00:58:50,285 --> 00:58:52,369
Hey, Sid, just think,
if they make a movie about you,

883
00:58:52,453 --> 00:58:53,746
who's gonna play you?

884
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,581
I shudder to think.

885
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:57,917
I see you as a young Meg Ryan, myself.

886
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:00,701
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck,
they'd cast Tori Spelling.

887
00:59:01,629 --> 00:59:03,298
I'm just gonna be a few minutes.

888
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:06,050
You girls don't go too far.

889
00:59:08,928 --> 00:59:10,429
Is Billy gonna be there tonight?

890
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:13,474
He better not be.
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.

891
00:59:13,558 --> 00:59:16,558
I think we can live without
the endorphin rush for one night.

892
00:59:18,771 --> 00:59:21,899
Billy's right, you know. Whenever
he touches me, I just can't relax.

893
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:25,778
So you have a few intimacy issues as
a result of your mother's untimely death.

894
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:28,155
It's no big deal, Sid. You'll thaw out.

895
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:31,700
Yeah, but he has been so patient with me,
you know, with all this sex stuff.

896
00:59:31,784 --> 00:59:35,134
How many guys will put up
with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

897
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:38,105
Billy and his penis
don't deserve you, all right?

898
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,051
Dewey, where the hell you been?

899
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:50,928
I was keeping an eye on Sidney.

900
00:59:53,348 --> 00:59:54,474
Thought you quit.

901
00:59:55,141 --> 00:59:56,934
I did, but damn it...

902
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:01,272
Dewey, Vital Phone just faxed us.

903
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:05,818
Those calls are listed to Neil Prescott,
Sidney's father.

904
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:09,402
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.

905
01:00:10,782 --> 01:00:13,482
Well, there's no way his cellular
could've been cloned?

906
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:16,120
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is?

907
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,082
The anniversary of his wife's death.

908
01:00:22,001 --> 01:00:24,878
We'll keep the roadblocks and the curfew
in effect through the night.

909
01:00:24,962 --> 01:00:28,162
If he's not picked up by morning,
then we'll do a house-to-house.

910
01:00:29,634 --> 01:00:30,635
Where's Sidney?

911
01:00:31,219 --> 01:00:33,669
She's with my sister.
You want me to bring her in?

912
01:00:35,056 --> 01:00:39,936
Not just yet. Let's find Neil first,
make sure he's our man.

913
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:50,405
You stay close to Sidney.

914
01:00:50,988 --> 01:00:52,573
Don't let her out of your sight.

915
01:00:52,657 --> 01:00:53,741
Yes, sir.

916
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,771
All right. You girls have fun.

917
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,565
Not too much fun, or I'll bust ya.

918
01:01:36,817 --> 01:01:38,277
- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.

919
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,958
We are here.

920
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,502
Yeah!

921
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:57,880
Oh, that's superb.

922
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,424
You guys are tardy for the party
so we started without you.

923
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,259
My man! Yeah!

924
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,071
Well, were we spotted?

925
01:02:23,155 --> 01:02:25,657
I don't think so. Now get the camera.

926
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:26,951
Ma'am...

927
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,902
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

928
01:02:30,287 --> 01:02:31,539
Deputy, that's okay.

929
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:33,881
What brings you to these parts?

930
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:38,004
Well, you just never know
when or where a story will break.

931
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:42,133
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cutting it loose.

932
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,927
Then what are you doing here?

933
01:02:47,596 --> 01:02:49,096
Just keeping an eye on things.

934
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,474
I'm gonna check the party out.

935
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,444
Do you mind if I join you?

936
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,480
Not at all.

937
01:02:57,606 --> 01:02:58,983
Let me just get my coat.

938
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,115
All right.

939
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:08,534
Yeah, I'm fine.

940
01:03:09,785 --> 01:03:10,953
Oh, yeah.

941
01:03:13,205 --> 01:03:14,582
How many <i>Evil Dead?</i>

942
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:17,334
- Yeah!
- How many <i>Hellraiser?</i>

943
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:18,961
<i>Hellraiser</i> right here.

944
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:22,047
<i>The Fog, Terror Train, Prom Night.</i>

945
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,842
How come Jamie Lee Curtis
is in all of these movies?

946
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,095
She's the... scream queen.

947
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,305
I mean, with a set of lungs like that,
she should be.

948
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,390
Yeah.

949
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,017
Tits. See?

950
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:34,852
I'll get it.

951
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:39,356
Hey, Tate, grab me another beer,
would you?

952
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,108
There's beer in the garage.

953
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,818
What am I, the beer wench?

954
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,195
She was nominated.

955
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:47,864
- She was nominated for <i>Terror Train.</i>
- You are not gonna believe who's here.

956
01:03:47,948 --> 01:03:49,199
It's that chick from <i>Top Story.</i>

957
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,433
- Gale Weathers?
- Here.

958
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,039
You're underage, son.

959
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,292
I'm kidding. Have a good time.
Watch the driving.

960
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,211
- Dewey?
- Hi.

961
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,921
Dewey?

962
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,090
What is she doing here?

963
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,508
She's with me.

964
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,218
I'm just checking things out.

965
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:12,598
So you did. Now leave.
And take your media muff with you.

966
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:17,519
- I just think you're awesome.
- Thank you very much.

967
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,688
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.

968
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,357
- Hey.
- Hey.

969
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,359
I'm getting a camera.

970
01:04:25,277 --> 01:04:28,155
- Have you found my father?
- I'm afraid not.

971
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,408
Should I be worried?

972
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,493
Not yet.

973
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,170
Jesus!

974
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,133
Tatum, it's okay.

975
01:05:39,426 --> 01:05:40,427
Shit.

976
01:05:45,849 --> 01:05:46,975
Hey, shitheads!

977
01:05:49,186 --> 01:05:50,270
Hello?

978
01:05:52,606 --> 01:05:54,149
Shit. Piss.

979
01:06:13,168 --> 01:06:14,211
Is that you, Randy?

980
01:06:16,797 --> 01:06:20,217
Cute. And what movie is this from?
<i>I Spit On Your Garage?</i>

981
01:06:21,635 --> 01:06:23,985
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.

982
01:06:25,639 --> 01:06:27,089
You wanna play psycho killer?

983
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,810
Can I be the helpless victim?

984
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:34,689
Okay, let's see.
No, please don't kill me, Mr. Ghostface.

985
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:36,233
I want to be in the sequel.

986
01:06:38,902 --> 01:06:41,196
Cut, Casper. That's a wrap.

987
01:06:43,907 --> 01:06:45,657
Randy, what the hell are you doing?

988
01:06:46,368 --> 01:06:47,870
Don't... What?

989
01:06:50,164 --> 01:06:51,165
Stop!

990
01:07:06,597 --> 01:07:08,098
Fucker!

991
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,719
No! No!

992
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:03,695
Happy curfew.

993
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,030
Nice party, Stu.

994
01:08:05,572 --> 01:08:06,739
Tatum, come on!

995
01:08:06,823 --> 01:08:08,533
Nobody here but us chickens!

996
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:11,217
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.

997
01:08:14,706 --> 01:08:15,999
Billy, hey.

998
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:18,585
Billy. What are you doing here?

999
01:08:19,253 --> 01:08:21,203
I was hoping I could talk to Sid alone.

1000
01:08:21,588 --> 01:08:24,090
You know, if Tatum sees you here,
she'll draw blood.

1001
01:08:24,174 --> 01:08:26,551
Tell you what, why don't you guys
go up to my parents' room?

1002
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:28,303
You know, you guys can talk

1003
01:08:29,263 --> 01:08:30,639
whatever.

1004
01:08:31,431 --> 01:08:33,381
"Subtlety," Stu, you should look it up.

1005
01:08:35,185 --> 01:08:37,229
No, it's okay. We do need to talk.

1006
01:08:47,322 --> 01:08:48,990
What's Leatherface doing here?

1007
01:08:49,074 --> 01:08:50,701
He came to make up.

1008
01:08:51,368 --> 01:08:53,704
There goes my chance with Sid. Damn it.

1009
01:08:54,496 --> 01:08:57,541
As if. That's all I'm saying. As if.

1010
01:08:58,584 --> 01:08:59,960
Oh, really, Alicia?

1011
01:09:01,587 --> 01:09:02,879
As if.

1012
01:09:02,963 --> 01:09:04,422
I'm gonna go check on them.

1013
01:09:04,506 --> 01:09:05,632
Come on!

1014
01:09:06,216 --> 01:09:08,092
<i>Okay, everyone.
It was nice to meet all of you.</i>

1015
01:09:08,176 --> 01:09:09,177
<i>Thank you.</i>

1016
01:09:10,804 --> 01:09:12,014
You're a genius.

1017
01:09:13,473 --> 01:09:15,392
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1018
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,311
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?

1019
01:09:18,395 --> 01:09:21,439
I don't know. What'd it take you
to walk from the house, 30 seconds?

1020
01:09:21,523 --> 01:09:23,024
It'll be fine. Just record it.

1021
01:09:23,108 --> 01:09:25,058
- All right.
- The placement is perfect.

1022
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:27,195
Tell me, Kenneth,

1023
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,282
has a cheesy tabloid journalist
ever won the Pulitzer?

1024
01:09:30,991 --> 01:09:32,326
First time for everything.

1025
01:09:32,993 --> 01:09:34,119
You're damn right.

1026
01:09:41,543 --> 01:09:42,586
So...

1027
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:46,840
So...

1028
01:09:50,344 --> 01:09:51,428
Look, I'm sorry.

1029
01:09:53,388 --> 01:09:55,098
I've been selfish,

1030
01:09:56,183 --> 01:09:57,475
and I want to apologize.

1031
01:09:57,559 --> 01:09:59,895
No. Billy, I'm

1032
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:04,357
the one who's been selfish
and self-absorbed

1033
01:10:04,441 --> 01:10:06,777
with all this post-traumatic stress.

1034
01:10:08,153 --> 01:10:09,153
You lost your mom.

1035
01:10:09,237 --> 01:10:11,073
Yeah, I know, but you're right.

1036
01:10:11,823 --> 01:10:17,913
Enough is enough. I can't wallow
in the grief process forever, and...

1037
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:25,754
And I can't keep lying to myself
about who my mom was.

1038
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:32,678
Yeah, I think I'm really...

1039
01:10:35,305 --> 01:10:36,348
scared

1040
01:10:37,683 --> 01:10:40,143
that I'm gonna turn out just like her,
you know?

1041
01:10:42,229 --> 01:10:44,356
Like the bad seed or something.

1042
01:10:45,732 --> 01:10:48,068
And I know it doesn't make sense.

1043
01:10:49,861 --> 01:10:50,987
Yeah, it does.

1044
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:59,329
It's like Jodie Foster
in <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>

1045
01:10:59,413 --> 01:11:03,166
when she keeps having flashbacks
of her dead father.

1046
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:04,626
But this is life.

1047
01:11:05,711 --> 01:11:06,837
This isn't a movie.

1048
01:11:07,379 --> 01:11:08,672
Sure it is, Sid.

1049
01:11:10,006 --> 01:11:12,718
It's all... it's all a movie. It's all

1050
01:11:13,927 --> 01:11:15,554
one great big movie.

1051
01:11:22,436 --> 01:11:24,730
Only you can't pick your genre.

1052
01:11:51,339 --> 01:11:53,633
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?

1053
01:11:57,512 --> 01:11:59,264
Or even a good porno?

1054
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:05,812
- What?
- You heard me.

1055
01:12:15,113 --> 01:12:16,323
Are you sure?

1056
01:12:18,492 --> 01:12:19,493
Yeah.

1057
01:12:20,744 --> 01:12:21,912
I think so.

1058
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:40,555
Look, look. Here it comes.

1059
01:12:42,641 --> 01:12:44,976
Oh, man,
the color of the blood is all wrong.

1060
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,603
Now why do they do that? It's too red!

1061
01:12:47,687 --> 01:12:49,313
Wait, here comes another one.

1062
01:12:49,397 --> 01:12:51,149
Here, here...

1063
01:12:51,733 --> 01:12:53,317
Yes! Yes!

1064
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:55,611
Predictable. I knew he was gonna bite it.

1065
01:12:55,695 --> 01:12:57,795
How can you watch this shit over and over?

1066
01:12:58,198 --> 01:13:00,742
When do we see breasts?
I want to see Jamie Lee's breasts.

1067
01:13:00,826 --> 01:13:02,785
- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Yes. Yes!

1068
01:13:02,869 --> 01:13:06,038
Breasts? Not until <i>Trading Places</i> in '83.

1069
01:13:06,122 --> 01:13:08,458
Jamie Lee was always the virgin
in horror movies.

1070
01:13:08,542 --> 01:13:11,002
She never showed her tits
till she went legits.

1071
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:12,754
Could afford a decent pair.

1072
01:13:12,838 --> 01:13:14,130
What'd you say?

1073
01:13:14,214 --> 01:13:17,300
That's why she always outsmarted
the killer in the chase scene at the end.

1074
01:13:17,384 --> 01:13:19,677
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?

1075
01:13:19,761 --> 01:13:21,053
What rules?

1076
01:13:21,137 --> 01:13:22,138
You don't...

1077
01:13:24,683 --> 01:13:26,934
Jesus Christ! You don't know the rules?

1078
01:13:27,018 --> 01:13:29,061
Have an aneurysm, why don't you?

1079
01:13:29,145 --> 01:13:31,856
There are certain rules
that one must abide by

1080
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,442
in order to successfully survive
a horror movie.

1081
01:13:34,526 --> 01:13:38,113
For instance, number one,
you can never have sex.

1082
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:40,156
No! No!

1083
01:13:40,824 --> 01:13:42,492
Big no-no! Big no-no!

1084
01:13:42,576 --> 01:13:44,368
I'd be a dead man.

1085
01:13:44,452 --> 01:13:46,370
Sex equals death, okay?

1086
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:49,541
Number two,
you can never drink or do drugs.

1087
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:54,420
No, the sin factor.

1088
01:13:54,504 --> 01:13:56,798
This is sin.
It's an extension of number one.

1089
01:13:56,882 --> 01:14:01,135
And number three, never, ever, ever,
under any circumstances, say,

1090
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:03,137
"I'll be right back,"
'cause you won't be back.

1091
01:14:03,221 --> 01:14:05,056
I'm getting another beer. You want one?

1092
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,475
- Yeah, sure.
- I'll be right back!

1093
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:12,980
You see, you push the laws,
and you end up dead, okay?

1094
01:14:13,064 --> 01:14:14,690
I'll see you in the kitchen with a knife.

1095
01:14:14,774 --> 01:14:18,069
<i>Only virgins can outsmart the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.</i>

1096
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:19,529
<i>Don't you know the rules?</i>

1097
01:14:19,613 --> 01:14:22,281
<i>- What rules?
- You don't know the rules?</i>

1098
01:14:22,365 --> 01:14:25,785
<i>There are certain rules that one must abide
by in order to successfully survive...</i>

1099
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:26,870
Boring.

1100
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:32,291
The sheriff just radioed.

1101
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:34,502
Somebody reported a car in the bushes
down the road.

1102
01:14:34,586 --> 01:14:37,088
I'm gonna go check it out.
You care to join me?

1103
01:14:37,881 --> 01:14:39,007
I'd love to.

1104
01:14:39,591 --> 01:14:41,176
If you're sure it's all right.

1105
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:44,763
Ma'am, I'm the deputy of this town.

1106
01:14:47,265 --> 01:14:48,516
Be right back.

1107
01:14:51,895 --> 01:14:54,981
<i>You see, you push the laws
and you end up dead, okay?</i>

1108
01:14:55,065 --> 01:14:56,107
Excuse me, ma'am.

1109
01:14:57,442 --> 01:14:59,110
I thought maybe we'd walk.

1110
01:15:00,946 --> 01:15:02,572
It's such a nice night out.

1111
01:15:03,406 --> 01:15:04,991
I got a flashlight.

1112
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:08,953
You're not scared, are you?

1113
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:10,038
No.

1114
01:15:10,997 --> 01:15:12,999
- All right.
- Great.

1115
01:15:17,545 --> 01:15:19,589
Do you know what that constellation is?

1116
01:15:19,673 --> 01:15:20,715
No. What is it?

1117
01:15:21,841 --> 01:15:23,941
I don't know. That's why I was asking you.

1118
01:15:26,888 --> 01:15:28,681
Take it easy, guys. You guys drive safe.

1119
01:15:28,765 --> 01:15:31,642
- So what happened to Tatum, Stu?
- Probably got pissed at me and bailed.

1120
01:15:31,726 --> 01:15:32,811
- Bye.
- Bye.

1121
01:15:35,522 --> 01:15:37,472
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding you.

1122
01:15:45,615 --> 01:15:46,616
Hey.

1123
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:56,543
Look! Here comes the obligatory tit shot.

1124
01:16:00,463 --> 01:16:02,048
- Yes!
- Lovely!

1125
01:16:04,342 --> 01:16:05,676
Oh, my God.

1126
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,178
I'll leave you guys alone.

1127
01:16:08,471 --> 01:16:09,889
You are so

1128
01:16:11,766 --> 01:16:12,851
amazing.

1129
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:20,400
Hello?

1130
01:16:20,942 --> 01:16:21,943
Yeah.

1131
01:16:26,823 --> 01:16:28,491
Holy shit.

1132
01:16:30,493 --> 01:16:31,494
No...

1133
01:16:32,954 --> 01:16:34,288
Listen up.

1134
01:16:34,372 --> 01:16:36,207
They found Principal Himbry dead.

1135
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:40,252
He was gutted and hung
from the goalpost on the football field.

1136
01:16:40,336 --> 01:16:41,629
What are we waiting for?

1137
01:16:41,713 --> 01:16:43,913
Let's go over there
before they pry him down.

1138
01:16:44,716 --> 01:16:45,717
Hey.

1139
01:16:46,968 --> 01:16:47,969
Hey.

1140
01:16:48,053 --> 01:16:49,470
Hey, where'd he say he was?

1141
01:16:49,554 --> 01:16:51,347
The football field! Come on!

1142
01:16:52,057 --> 01:16:53,224
Where you guys going?

1143
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,460
We were just getting to the good part.

1144
01:16:58,354 --> 01:16:59,563
<i>Hello?</i>

1145
01:16:59,647 --> 01:17:00,648
<i>Yeah.</i>

1146
01:17:25,298 --> 01:17:26,633
Come on! Let's go!

1147
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:29,427
So, is Dewey your real name?

1148
01:17:30,303 --> 01:17:31,846
No, it's Dwight.

1149
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:32,931
Dwight?

1150
01:17:33,556 --> 01:17:35,767
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1151
01:17:36,392 --> 01:17:39,142
Dewey's just something I got stuck with
a long time ago.

1152
01:17:40,063 --> 01:17:41,231
Well, I like it.

1153
01:17:43,024 --> 01:17:44,025
Sexy.

1154
01:17:44,567 --> 01:17:45,652
Sexy?

1155
01:17:47,487 --> 01:17:50,198
It's just this town's way
of not taking me serious.

1156
01:17:50,865 --> 01:17:52,367
What about Gale Weathers?

1157
01:17:53,618 --> 01:17:56,162
Sounds like I'm a meteorologist
or something.

1158
01:17:57,831 --> 01:18:01,709
People treat me like I'm the Antichrist
of television journalism.

1159
01:18:02,961 --> 01:18:04,336
I don't think you're that bad.

1160
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:05,504
- No?
- No.

1161
01:18:05,588 --> 01:18:07,888
I think that's just 'cause
you kind of like me.

1162
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:11,261
They sure are coming fast.
Slow down. Freeze!

1163
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:17,851
I'm sorry.

1164
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:19,853
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1165
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:33,700
I'm sorry.

1166
01:18:34,325 --> 01:18:35,368
I'm on duty.

1167
01:18:44,294 --> 01:18:45,894
Is that what you're looking for?

1168
01:18:46,796 --> 01:18:47,839
My whole life.

1169
01:18:53,887 --> 01:18:55,263
- Damn.
- What?

1170
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:58,224
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.

1171
01:18:58,308 --> 01:18:59,934
- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.

1172
01:19:02,145 --> 01:19:03,730
Jesus. What's he doing here?

1173
01:19:05,648 --> 01:19:06,733
We got to get back.

1174
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,280
Are you okay?

1175
01:19:14,782 --> 01:19:15,783
Yeah.

1176
01:19:16,826 --> 01:19:17,911
Yeah, I'm fine.

1177
01:19:29,339 --> 01:19:30,465
Who'd you call?

1178
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:32,342
What?

1179
01:19:33,218 --> 01:19:35,094
Well, I don't know. When you're arrested,

1180
01:19:35,178 --> 01:19:38,578
you're allowed one phone call,
so I was just curious. Who'd you call?

1181
01:19:41,809 --> 01:19:42,977
I called my dad.

1182
01:19:45,772 --> 01:19:49,025
No. Sheriff Burke called your dad.
I saw him.

1183
01:19:52,028 --> 01:19:55,365
Yeah. But when I called,
I didn't get an answer.

1184
01:20:07,085 --> 01:20:09,087
You don't still think it was me, do you?

1185
01:20:13,299 --> 01:20:14,300
No.

1186
01:20:16,052 --> 01:20:17,053
No.

1187
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,138
I was just thinking if it were you,

1188
01:20:19,222 --> 01:20:22,266
it'd be a very clever way
to throw me off track.

1189
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,185
You know, using your one phone call
to call me

1190
01:20:24,269 --> 01:20:26,619
so that I wouldn't think it was you.
That's all.

1191
01:20:28,273 --> 01:20:29,315
Really?

1192
01:20:37,323 --> 01:20:41,703
What do I have to do to prove to you
that I'm not a killer?

1193
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:44,580
Oh, my God.

1194
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,959
- Oh, my God!
- Sidney.

1195
01:20:49,043 --> 01:20:50,044
Billy, watch out!

1196
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:01,556
Sid.

1197
01:21:39,177 --> 01:21:40,178
Shit.

1198
01:21:46,809 --> 01:21:49,103
Help me, somebody! Help me!

1199
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:08,581
Help me!

1200
01:22:39,946 --> 01:22:41,239
No, Jamie.

1201
01:22:43,157 --> 01:22:44,367
Watch out.

1202
01:22:44,909 --> 01:22:47,077
Watch out, Jamie. You know he's around.

1203
01:22:47,161 --> 01:22:48,371
You... You know...

1204
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:54,127
There he is. I told you.
I told you. He's right around the corner.

1205
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:57,547
Jamie... Jamie.

1206
01:22:58,965 --> 01:23:03,344
Jamie, look behind you.
Look behind you. Turn around.

1207
01:23:04,554 --> 01:23:06,722
Behind you. Turn...

1208
01:23:07,557 --> 01:23:08,975
Behind you.

1209
01:23:09,809 --> 01:23:11,352
Behind you, Jamie.

1210
01:23:12,186 --> 01:23:16,357
Jamie, turn around.
All right! You turned around.

1211
01:23:16,441 --> 01:23:18,067
Help me! Help!

1212
01:23:31,289 --> 01:23:32,415
Let me in!

1213
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:36,668
- The killer's after me. He's in the house.
- Where?

1214
01:23:36,752 --> 01:23:38,921
Wait a minute.
There's a camera in the house. Look.

1215
01:23:39,005 --> 01:23:41,507
<i>Behind you!</i>

1216
01:23:42,383 --> 01:23:43,468
- Oh, shit.
- No.

1217
01:23:44,302 --> 01:23:45,719
<i>Jamie, Jamie...</i>

1218
01:23:45,803 --> 01:23:47,103
- Behind you, kid!
- Randy!

1219
01:23:48,055 --> 01:23:50,433
- Behind you!
<i>- Look around.</i>

1220
01:23:53,186 --> 01:23:54,436
Shit.

1221
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,320
- What?
- We're on a 30-second delay.

1222
01:23:57,106 --> 01:23:58,107
Oh, my God.

1223
01:24:51,536 --> 01:24:53,386
- Is there a phone in the van?
- Yeah.

1224
01:24:54,997 --> 01:24:57,458
Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.

1225
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:00,962
Be careful.

1226
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:15,977
Neil?

1227
01:25:22,441 --> 01:25:23,609
Mr. Prescott?

1228
01:25:44,463 --> 01:25:46,007
Kenny, I need the cellular!

1229
01:25:50,469 --> 01:25:51,512
Kenny!

1230
01:25:53,347 --> 01:25:54,348
Kenny!

1231
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:21,542
<i>- 911.</i>
- What's going on?

1232
01:26:36,223 --> 01:26:37,224
Oh, God.

1233
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:57,203
Oh, God, Kenny, I'm sorry,
but get off my fucking windshield!

1234
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:03,668
Stop!

1235
01:27:12,593 --> 01:27:13,719
No!

1236
01:27:24,021 --> 01:27:25,022
Dewey!

1237
01:27:26,565 --> 01:27:27,733
Dewey, where are you?

1238
01:27:30,611 --> 01:27:31,612
Dewey!

1239
01:27:33,656 --> 01:27:34,699
Sidney?

1240
01:27:40,371 --> 01:27:41,372
Dewey!

1241
01:28:09,942 --> 01:28:10,943
Shit.

1242
01:28:41,682 --> 01:28:44,643
Hello? Help me, please.
I'm at Stu Macher's house on Turner Lane.

1243
01:28:44,727 --> 01:28:48,522
It's 261 Turner Lane. Please!
He's gonna try and kill me!

1244
01:28:49,064 --> 01:28:50,524
Oh, God!

1245
01:29:11,504 --> 01:29:13,130
Sidney!

1246
01:29:14,256 --> 01:29:17,217
Sidney, Jesus,
we got to get the fuck out of here!

1247
01:29:17,301 --> 01:29:19,136
- Stop right there!
- Don't shoot! It's me!

1248
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,680
I found Tatum.
She's dead! I think Stu did it.

1249
01:29:21,764 --> 01:29:23,724
- Don't listen to him, Sidney!
- Stay back.

1250
01:29:23,808 --> 01:29:25,642
- Stu did it!
- He killed Billy.

1251
01:29:25,726 --> 01:29:28,019
- He killed my Tatum. He killed Billy.
- Stu did it.

1252
01:29:28,103 --> 01:29:29,646
- No, I didn't!
- He's lying!

1253
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:33,400
Sidney, baby, please give me that gun.
Give me that gun! He killed Billy.

1254
01:29:33,484 --> 01:29:36,528
No, I didn't, Sid. He did it!

1255
01:29:36,612 --> 01:29:38,196
He did it, Sidney!

1256
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,157
Please, I didn't do it. He did it. Please!

1257
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:42,743
- Please, Sidney!
- Fuck you both!

1258
01:29:42,827 --> 01:29:43,869
- Please.
- No! No!

1259
01:29:43,953 --> 01:29:44,995
Sidney!

1260
01:29:46,247 --> 01:29:48,499
- Open up, Sid!
- We won't make it!

1261
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:52,044
Help me, he's gone crazy!

1262
01:29:52,962 --> 01:29:54,588
- Sidney!
- Go away!

1263
01:29:55,297 --> 01:29:56,298
Sidney?

1264
01:29:57,424 --> 01:29:58,801
Leave me alone.

1265
01:30:05,057 --> 01:30:06,392
- Sid.
- Billy.

1266
01:30:14,024 --> 01:30:16,401
- Billy! Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1267
01:30:16,485 --> 01:30:18,653
Oh, God. I thought you were dead.

1268
01:30:18,737 --> 01:30:21,115
No. I mean, I got stuck pretty bad...

1269
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:22,741
Get up.

1270
01:30:23,909 --> 01:30:25,870
- You okay?
- You're bleeding.

1271
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:28,538
- Oh, my God.
- Gotta get help.

1272
01:30:28,622 --> 01:30:29,706
No! He's out there!

1273
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:33,794
No. Give me the gun. Give me the gun.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1274
01:30:34,837 --> 01:30:35,838
Careful.

1275
01:30:37,882 --> 01:30:39,758
- Please help me!
- Get in. Get in.

1276
01:30:40,426 --> 01:30:42,720
Stu's flipped out! He's gone mad!

1277
01:30:45,222 --> 01:30:47,307
We all go a little mad sometimes.

1278
01:30:47,391 --> 01:30:48,976
- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!

1279
01:30:56,233 --> 01:30:58,152
Anthony Perkins, <i>Psycho.</i>

1280
01:31:05,534 --> 01:31:06,910
Corn syrup.

1281
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:09,330
Same stuff they used
for pig's blood in <i>Carrie.</i>

1282
01:31:10,539 --> 01:31:12,041
No. No.

1283
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,878
Stu, help me, please.

1284
01:31:18,797 --> 01:31:20,716
Surprise, Sidney.

1285
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:26,639
No!

1286
01:31:27,723 --> 01:31:28,724
Oh, now.

1287
01:31:32,811 --> 01:31:35,811
What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1288
01:31:36,649 --> 01:31:38,191
Why are you doing this?

1289
01:31:38,275 --> 01:31:40,443
It's all part of the game, Sidney.

1290
01:31:40,527 --> 01:31:43,280
- It's called Guess How I'm Gonna Die!
- Fuck you!

1291
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:47,159
No, no, no, no. We already played
that game, remember?

1292
01:31:48,035 --> 01:31:49,536
You lost.

1293
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:51,079
See, fun and games, Sidney.

1294
01:31:51,163 --> 01:31:53,958
See, we ask you a question.
If you get it wrong

1295
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:56,376
you die.

1296
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:58,671
If you get it right, you die.

1297
01:31:59,588 --> 01:32:01,214
You're crazy, both of you.

1298
01:32:01,298 --> 01:32:03,425
Actually we prefer the term psychotic.

1299
01:32:03,509 --> 01:32:05,109
You'll never get away with this.

1300
01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:06,971
Oh, no?

1301
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,807
Tell that to Cotton Weary.

1302
01:32:10,557 --> 01:32:13,268
You wouldn't believe
how easy he was to frame.

1303
01:32:13,936 --> 01:32:16,397
Watch a few movies, take a few notes.

1304
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:18,649
It was fun.

1305
01:32:19,274 --> 01:32:21,276
- No!
- Where you going?

1306
01:32:23,237 --> 01:32:24,238
Why?

1307
01:32:26,031 --> 01:32:27,407
Why did you kill my mother?

1308
01:32:27,491 --> 01:32:28,783
Why?

1309
01:32:28,867 --> 01:32:29,952
Why?

1310
01:32:31,996 --> 01:32:34,296
You hear that, Stu?
I think she wants a motive.

1311
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:37,459
I don't believe in motives, Sid.

1312
01:32:37,543 --> 01:32:39,961
- I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
- No.

1313
01:32:40,045 --> 01:32:42,589
Did they ever really decide why
Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?

1314
01:32:42,673 --> 01:32:44,215
Don't think so.

1315
01:32:44,299 --> 01:32:46,927
See, it's a lot scarier
when there's no motive, Sid.

1316
01:32:48,262 --> 01:32:49,679
We did your mom a favor, Sid.

1317
01:32:49,763 --> 01:32:52,390
That woman was a slutbag whore
who flashed her shit all over town

1318
01:32:52,474 --> 01:32:54,351
like she was Sharon Stone or something.

1319
01:32:54,435 --> 01:32:56,895
Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
'cause let's face it, Sidney,

1320
01:32:56,979 --> 01:32:59,231
your mother was no Sharon Stone.

1321
01:33:05,362 --> 01:33:06,905
Is that motive enough for you?

1322
01:33:10,034 --> 01:33:11,326
How about this?

1323
01:33:12,995 --> 01:33:16,623
Your slut mother was fucking my father...

1324
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:21,628
and she's the reason
my mom moved out and abandoned me.

1325
01:33:24,506 --> 01:33:25,966
How's that for a motive?

1326
01:33:27,718 --> 01:33:30,095
Maternal abandonment
causes serious deviant behavior.

1327
01:33:30,179 --> 01:33:33,306
Certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.

1328
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:35,600
That's right. You gave it up.

1329
01:33:35,684 --> 01:33:37,352
Now you're no longer a virgin.

1330
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:39,188
I said "virgin."

1331
01:33:40,105 --> 01:33:43,066
Now you gotta die. Those are the rules.

1332
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:45,235
Just pretend it's all a scary movie, Sid.

1333
01:33:45,944 --> 01:33:47,544
How do you think it's gonna end?

1334
01:33:51,617 --> 01:33:54,202
This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.

1335
01:33:54,286 --> 01:33:56,080
We got a surprise for you, Sidney.

1336
01:33:56,663 --> 01:33:59,666
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!

1337
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:01,919
Hold on a sec. I'll be right back.

1338
01:34:03,754 --> 01:34:05,089
Know what time it is, Sid?

1339
01:34:05,839 --> 01:34:06,924
It's after midnight.

1340
01:34:07,633 --> 01:34:09,384
It's your mom's anniversary.

1341
01:34:10,135 --> 01:34:13,722
Congratulations. We killed her exactly
one year ago today.

1342
01:34:14,598 --> 01:34:15,974
Attention.

1343
01:34:17,059 --> 01:34:19,060
What do we have
behind door number three, Sidney?

1344
01:34:19,144 --> 01:34:21,939
- Daddy!
- Hold it. That's enough.

1345
01:34:23,315 --> 01:34:25,984
Guess we won't be needing
this anymore, huh?

1346
01:34:26,068 --> 01:34:28,153
And, oh, look at this. Ring, ring.

1347
01:34:28,237 --> 01:34:29,362
Won't need this.

1348
01:34:29,446 --> 01:34:31,031
Got the ending figured out yet, Sid?

1349
01:34:31,115 --> 01:34:33,283
Come on, Sidney,
you think about it now, huh?

1350
01:34:33,367 --> 01:34:36,327
Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.

1351
01:34:36,411 --> 01:34:38,371
Evidence is all right there, baby.

1352
01:34:38,455 --> 01:34:40,957
What if your father snapped,
your mother's anniversary set him off,

1353
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:43,209
and he went on a murder spree
killing everyone?

1354
01:34:43,293 --> 01:34:45,545
Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.

1355
01:34:45,629 --> 01:34:50,509
Then he kills you
and shoots himself in the head.

1356
01:34:51,426 --> 01:34:52,510
Perfect ending.

1357
01:34:52,594 --> 01:34:54,388
I thought of that.

1358
01:34:55,139 --> 01:34:56,265
Watch this.

1359
01:35:01,145 --> 01:35:02,479
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1360
01:35:02,563 --> 01:35:06,691
Yeah! I'm ready, baby! Hit it!

1361
01:35:06,775 --> 01:35:09,570
Giddyap! Yeah, man! Giddyap! Hit it!

1362
01:35:14,366 --> 01:35:16,951
Good one, man! Jesus!

1363
01:35:17,035 --> 01:35:19,538
Oh, shit! My turn.

1364
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:26,211
Don't forget.
Stay to the side and don't go too deep.

1365
01:35:27,546 --> 01:35:29,840
Okay. I'll remember.

1366
01:35:31,675 --> 01:35:32,801
Fuck!

1367
01:35:34,428 --> 01:35:36,346
Fuck! God damn it, Stu!

1368
01:35:37,014 --> 01:35:40,058
Sorry, Billy.
I guess I got a little too zealous, huh?

1369
01:35:41,351 --> 01:35:43,187
- Give me the knife.
- No.

1370
01:35:44,396 --> 01:35:45,606
Give me the knife!

1371
01:35:48,984 --> 01:35:50,319
Now!

1372
01:35:53,155 --> 01:35:57,951
You see, Sid? Everybody dies, but us.
Everybody dies, but us!

1373
01:35:58,035 --> 01:36:00,578
We get to carry on and plan the sequel

1374
01:36:00,662 --> 01:36:04,958
'cause let's face it, baby,
these days, you gotta have a sequel!

1375
01:36:08,003 --> 01:36:10,588
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.

1376
01:36:10,672 --> 01:36:13,007
No, Sid, don't you blame the movies!

1377
01:36:13,091 --> 01:36:16,970
Movies don't create psychos.
Movies make psychos more creative!

1378
01:36:18,931 --> 01:36:21,850
Stop it, man, would you? All right?
I can't take any more.

1379
01:36:22,559 --> 01:36:24,770
I'm feeling a little woozy here!

1380
01:36:27,272 --> 01:36:28,273
All right.

1381
01:36:30,067 --> 01:36:33,195
You get the gun,
and I'll untie Pops, okay?

1382
01:36:36,615 --> 01:36:37,616
Now!

1383
01:36:38,784 --> 01:36:39,785
Okay.

1384
01:36:51,588 --> 01:36:55,217
Houston, we have a problem here.

1385
01:36:57,261 --> 01:36:58,344
What?

1386
01:36:58,428 --> 01:37:02,307
The gun, man. The gun.
I put it right here, and it's not there.

1387
01:37:03,558 --> 01:37:04,976
Where the fuck is it?

1388
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,270
Right here, asshole.

1389
01:37:09,106 --> 01:37:13,193
- Man, I thought she was dead.
- She looked dead, man. Still does.

1390
01:37:13,277 --> 01:37:14,777
I've got an ending for you.

1391
01:37:14,861 --> 01:37:17,322
"The reporter left for dead
in the news van

1392
01:37:17,906 --> 01:37:22,369
comes to, stumbles on you two dipshits,

1393
01:37:23,245 --> 01:37:27,708
"finds the gun,
foils your plan, and saves the day."

1394
01:37:29,543 --> 01:37:30,919
I like that ending.

1395
01:37:32,879 --> 01:37:34,464
I know something you don't.

1396
01:37:43,307 --> 01:37:44,516
Yeah, man!

1397
01:37:45,684 --> 01:37:46,685
Yeah.

1398
01:37:48,812 --> 01:37:50,147
So sweet.

1399
01:37:54,568 --> 01:37:56,737
Works better without the safety on.

1400
01:38:05,537 --> 01:38:07,747
"This is Gale Weathers, signing off."

1401
01:38:07,831 --> 01:38:09,916
Baby, you are gonna love this.

1402
01:38:12,085 --> 01:38:13,211
Shit.

1403
01:38:15,797 --> 01:38:16,798
What?

1404
01:38:23,513 --> 01:38:25,063
Where are they? Where are they?

1405
01:38:25,724 --> 01:38:27,934
I don't know, Billy, but I'm hurting, man!

1406
01:38:28,018 --> 01:38:29,061
Fuck!

1407
01:38:31,521 --> 01:38:33,121
Should I let the machine get it?

1408
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:37,069
- Hello?
<i>- Are you alone in the house?</i>

1409
01:38:37,944 --> 01:38:40,321
Bitch! You bitch! Where the fuck are you?

1410
01:38:40,405 --> 01:38:43,157
<i>Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little game.</i>

1411
01:38:43,241 --> 01:38:44,951
<i>It's called
Guess Who Just Called the Police</i>

1412
01:38:45,035 --> 01:38:47,135
<i>and Reported Your Sorry Motherfucking Ass!</i>

1413
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:49,664
Find her, you dipshit! Get up!

1414
01:38:49,748 --> 01:38:53,877
I can't, Billy. You cut me too deep.
I think I'm dying here, man.

1415
01:38:57,381 --> 01:38:59,216
Talk to her. Talk to her.

1416
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:07,598
Hello?

1417
01:39:07,682 --> 01:39:11,769
<i>Aw, Stu, Stu, Stu.
What's your motive? Billy's got one.</i>

1418
01:39:11,853 --> 01:39:14,147
<i>The police are on their way.
What are you gonna tell them?</i>

1419
01:39:14,231 --> 01:39:16,607
Peer pressure. I'm far too sensitive...

1420
01:39:16,691 --> 01:39:19,319
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch!
Just like your fucking mother!

1421
01:39:19,403 --> 01:39:21,863
<i>You've gotta find me first,
you pansy-ass mama's boy!</i>

1422
01:39:21,947 --> 01:39:22,948
Fuck!

1423
01:39:23,573 --> 01:39:25,867
Fucking hit me with the phone, dick!

1424
01:39:26,993 --> 01:39:28,161
Fucker, where are you?

1425
01:39:30,747 --> 01:39:31,748
You fuck!

1426
01:39:34,209 --> 01:39:35,710
Did you really call the police?

1427
01:39:35,794 --> 01:39:37,337
<i>You bet your sorry ass I did.</i>

1428
01:39:38,296 --> 01:39:41,633
My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me.

1429
01:39:43,051 --> 01:39:44,052
Bitch!

1430
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:42,611
My eyes!

1431
01:40:50,869 --> 01:40:53,288
I always had a thing for you, Sid!

1432
01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:57,834
God.

1433
01:40:59,002 --> 01:40:59,961
Bitch.

1434
01:41:01,046 --> 01:41:02,130
In your dreams.

1435
01:41:27,197 --> 01:41:29,031
Sid! I'm sorry. It's all right.

1436
01:41:29,115 --> 01:41:31,200
Oh, my God, Randy.
I thought you were dead.

1437
01:41:31,284 --> 01:41:34,684
I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.

1438
01:41:35,539 --> 01:41:36,540
Fucker!

1439
01:41:43,588 --> 01:41:45,131
Say hello to your mother.

1440
01:42:20,792 --> 01:42:21,793
It's okay.

1441
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:28,466
Guess I remembered the safety that time,
you bastard.

1442
01:42:41,104 --> 01:42:42,105
Careful.

1443
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:46,442
This is the moment when the supposedly
dead killer comes back to life

1444
01:42:46,526 --> 01:42:47,902
for one last scare.

1445
01:42:53,491 --> 01:42:54,868
Not in my movie.

1446
01:43:00,957 --> 01:43:02,083
Dad.

1447
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,711
Randy, help me out.

1448
01:43:09,341 --> 01:43:10,383
Are you okay?

1449
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:15,096
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1450
01:43:16,973 --> 01:43:18,808
- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.

1451
01:43:20,769 --> 01:43:22,687
- It collapses.
- Where's Gale?

1452
01:43:23,813 --> 01:43:27,113
Okay, I think it's gonna go
something like this. Just stay with me.

1453
01:43:28,652 --> 01:43:32,029
Hi. This is Gale Weathers
with an exclusive eyewitness account

1454
01:43:32,113 --> 01:43:34,032
of this amazing breaking story.

1455
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:39,662
Several more local teens are dead,
bringing to an end the harrowing mystery

1456
01:43:39,746 --> 01:43:43,082
of the mass killing
that has terrified this peaceful community

1457
01:43:43,166 --> 01:43:45,251
like the plot of some scary movie.

1458
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,546
It all began with a scream over 911

1459
01:43:48,630 --> 01:43:52,300
and ended in a bloodbath
that has rocked the town of Woodsboro,

1460
01:43:52,926 --> 01:43:55,386
all played out here
in this peaceful farmhouse,

1461
01:43:55,470 --> 01:43:58,222
far from the crimes and the sirens
of the larger cities

1462
01:43:58,306 --> 01:44:00,224
that its residents have fled.

1463
01:44:00,308 --> 01:44:01,809
Okay, let's take it back to one.

1464
01:44:01,893 --> 01:44:04,521
Come on. Move it.
This is my big shot. Let's go.
