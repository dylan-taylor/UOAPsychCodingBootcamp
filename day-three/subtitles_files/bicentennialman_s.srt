1
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,353
Nice place.
I've seen better.

2
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:00,785
Everybody downstairs.

3
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:06,416
Good afternoon.
Afternoon, sir.

4
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:08,877
Where do you want this?
Just through there.

5
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:11,046
Come on, you guys. I've got a surprise.

6
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:14,758
Want to place him right over here, sir?
Here's a place.

7
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:16,760
Move it over here.

8
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:24,684
Sweetie, come away from it, please.

9
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:28,980
What is it, Daddy?
Wait.

10
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:02,222
Thank you, sir. Enjoy your NDR.

11
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:21,449
North Am Robotics,
household model, NDR-114.

12
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,577
Serial number 583625.

13
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:33,086
Hello.

14
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:35,338
Hello.

15
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:40,010
Are you one's family?

16
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:44,139
I guess so.

17
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:57,402
It's scary.
It's not scary. It's stupid.

18
00:05:57,944 --> 00:05:59,112
I doubt that.

19
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:02,490
Jenny Harrison's family's got one.
So did Kate McCalister.

20
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:05,285
They're all the same.
What is it?

21
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:06,745
It's an android.

22
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:08,580
What's an Andrew?

23
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,043
Will that be one's name?

24
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,461
Why not?

25
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:16,213
Sounds good.

26
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:18,173
Hello, Andrew.

27
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:19,466
Hello, Sir.

28
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:22,469
Care to hear
"The Three Laws of Robotics"?

29
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:25,263
It's said to be a most
entertaining presentation.

30
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:27,015
Sure.

31
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:30,268
Will you step back, Sir,
to maximise presentation?

32
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,493
First Law of Robotics:

33
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,454
A robot may not injure a human being...

34
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:53,083
...or, through inaction,
cause a human being to come to harm.

35
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,710
Second Law:

36
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:58,797
A robot must obey all human orders...

37
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:02,968
...except where those orders
come in conflict with the first law.

38
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:04,469
Third Law:

39
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:07,472
A robot must protect itself
so long as doing so...

40
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:10,851
...does not conflict with the first two laws.

41
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:18,525
Andrew, don't ever do that again.

42
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:21,820
Of course not, Sir. It is a one-time only.

43
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:25,949
There is another option
that one is obligated to point out.

44
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:28,702
You may have one
with or without personality.

45
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:31,580
Would you care to see a demo
of the personality chip?

46
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:33,957
No, thank you.
We'll stick with what we've got.

47
00:07:34,082 --> 00:07:36,376
A wise choice, Sir, if one may say so.

48
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,837
Well, you'll be staying down here.

49
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:41,047
Got everything you need?

50
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:43,592
One only requires access to a power outlet.

51
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:44,634
Good.

52
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,598
Good night, Andrew.

53
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,600
It certainly is, Sir.

54
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:57,189
No, Andrew, the correct response
to "Good night" is "Good night."

55
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,400
Good night.
Yes.

56
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,652
You just said, "Yes."

57
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:07,115
But the correct response to "Good night"
is "Good night."

58
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:10,368
Good night, Andrew.
Good night, Sir.

59
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:14,748
Good night, Andrew.
Good night, Sir.

60
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:17,334
You only need to say it once.

61
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,628
Or one would be saying it forever, Sir.

62
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:21,588
In an infinite verbal loop.

63
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,131
Exactly.

64
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,342
Thank you, Sir.

65
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:26,593
Good.

66
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:27,844
Night.

67
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:32,057
Sorry, Sir.

68
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:20,063
Honey, I don't want it following me
around the house all day.

69
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:21,940
Can't you turn it off?

70
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:23,942
Just give him a job.

71
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:26,820
You'll be okay.

72
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:29,030
Seat belts.

73
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:34,327
Good morning, Mr. Martin. Today's
temperature will be in the high 70s.

74
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:35,412
Bye, Mom!

75
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:39,624
Have a good day, sweethearts!
Have a good day, sweethearts!

76
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:18,598
Andrew, this is very good.
Thank you, Sir.

77
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,976
Don't you think?
I think it sucks.

78
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:25,021
Sucks? How? Chickens do not have lips.

79
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:29,109
She's being rude.

80
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:31,736
You mind your manners,
young lady, please.

81
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:35,365
We're fine.

82
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:37,742
Indeed, you are, Sir.

83
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:40,495
The kitchen.

84
00:11:42,414 --> 00:11:43,957
It's fine too, Sir.

85
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,460
No. Go to the kitchen now.

86
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:03,185
Hello.

87
00:12:12,694 --> 00:12:13,862
Come on.

88
00:12:25,498 --> 00:12:26,917
It's a big bluff.

89
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,632
Just a pretty face.

90
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,567
Check.

91
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:57,656
Andrew, could you come up?

92
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:04,371
Should I?
It'll be fine.

93
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:12,379
Yes, Miss?

94
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:15,048
Would you please open the window?

95
00:13:15,215 --> 00:13:17,175
One is glad to be of service.

96
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:26,518
A lovely breeze.

97
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:28,687
Now jump.

98
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:33,525
No.

99
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:36,069
Out the window.

100
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:47,622
Did you hear something?
Was that an earthquake?

101
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:10,937
Sorry for the inconvenience.

102
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:13,690
May one reenter?

103
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:15,400
What happened?

104
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:18,195
For the sake of family harmony...

105
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:21,781
...one is programmed not to tell.

106
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:33,919
Amanda! Grace!

107
00:14:34,294 --> 00:14:35,921
Downstairs right away.

108
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:40,967
Come in, Andrew.
Thank you, Sir.

109
00:14:57,484 --> 00:15:00,195
Andrew is not a person.
He is a form of property.

110
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:02,072
One is not a...

111
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,203
But property is also important.

112
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,498
So from now on, as a matter of principle...

113
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:15,418
...in this family, Andrew will be treated
as if he were a person.

114
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,464
There will be no more attempts
to break him.

115
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:21,299
Break him?

116
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:24,135
Your sister tried to kill Andrew.

117
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:28,557
You, too?

118
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:31,893
Sorry.

119
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,730
Come on. Everyone up to bed.

120
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:40,151
Will you be all right?

121
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:42,863
One is capable of self-maintenance, Sir.

122
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:44,614
Good.

123
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:48,368
Good night, Andrew.
Good night, Andrew.

124
00:16:23,904 --> 00:16:27,490
Miss! One has been given specific
orders for your safety...

125
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:31,745
...and that is an unsafe area.
Now come down!

126
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:34,206
Okay.

127
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:36,458
Thank you.

128
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:40,003
"I think it's going to be sunny tonight."

129
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:41,296
"Me too!"

130
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:44,508
"So do I."

131
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:53,433
He's my favourite.

132
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:56,394
Pretty.

133
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,314
Would you like to hold him?

134
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:11,993
That was my favourite.

135
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,249
They don't even make him anymore.

136
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,918
Can it be repaired?

137
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:21,503
No, it can't!

138
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:23,505
You're screwed!

139
00:17:23,922 --> 00:17:25,090
I hate you.

140
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:27,884
Get away from me.

141
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:36,017
Can we fix him?

142
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:40,730
No. Look at him.
He's in a million pieces. I'm sorry.

143
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:44,776
There's nothing you can do.

144
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:42,292
Yes, Little Miss?

145
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,212
This is the best present I ever got.

146
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,840
One is glad to be of service.

147
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:51,468
Would you please come with me?

148
00:18:53,303 --> 00:18:55,138
Does this involve a window?

149
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,515
No.

150
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:04,814
You can sit here.

151
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:14,199
His name is Woofy.

152
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:18,995
And from now on he's yours.

153
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:23,708
Woofy.

154
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:26,920
Because sometimes he barks.

155
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:32,175
Once he gets to know you.

156
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,224
Thank you very much.

157
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:41,434
You're welcome.

158
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,187
I have to go to sleep now, Andrew.

159
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:46,773
Yes.

160
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:49,526
Can you kind of...

161
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:52,112
Of course.

162
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:01,288
Good night, sweetheart.

163
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:03,373
Good night, Andrew.

164
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:24,102
Little Miss.
Sure. Thanks.

165
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:25,103
Miss?

166
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,028
After you.
Thank you.

167
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:34,404
You're welcome.

168
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:39,159
Andrew, did you really make this?

169
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:41,203
Yes, Sir.

170
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:46,082
A robot cannot tell a lie, Andrew.

171
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,543
That is not entirely correct, Sir.

172
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,921
One could lie if one were ordered to lie...

173
00:20:51,004 --> 00:20:54,591
...or if it were necessary in order
to keep a human being from harm...

174
00:20:54,716 --> 00:20:56,551
...or for one's own safety.

175
00:20:58,094 --> 00:21:00,639
One did indeed carve that for Little Miss.

176
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:04,684
And you're responsible for the design?
Yes, Sir.

177
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:06,937
What did you copy it from?

178
00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:09,147
Copy it, ma'am?

179
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:13,485
You didn't just get it out of thin air.

180
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,531
You got it out of some book,
or you used the computer to plot it out.

181
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:21,868
One did nothing more than study
the raw material for a time...

182
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:25,372
...until one came to understand
how best to carve it into a shape...

183
00:21:25,455 --> 00:21:28,792
...that would appeal to Little Miss'
love of tiny mammals.

184
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:20,278
Yes, please, come in.

185
00:23:21,905 --> 00:23:25,825
I'm so glad you called. Mansky.
Dennis Mansky.

186
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:27,452
Richard Martin.

187
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:31,331
And an NDR-114.

188
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:36,211
Now, I got your message
but what exactly is it doing?

189
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,718
What interests me is he shows a number
of characteristics like creativity...

190
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:49,349
...curiosity, friendship that, frankly,
have taken us by surprise.

191
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:54,646
Andrew.
Yes, Dennis?

192
00:23:56,022 --> 00:23:57,399
Social, as well.

193
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,278
Now, I'd like to show you something,
if I may.

194
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,906
Andrew carved these.

195
00:24:06,324 --> 00:24:08,535
These are original works of art.

196
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:13,331
And last night Andrew said,
"I enjoy making them."

197
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,292
"Enjoy"?

198
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:19,212
Should one not use that word?
No, it's fine, Andrew.

199
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:23,800
You see what I mean? It's unusual to hear
a robot talk about enjoying something.

200
00:24:24,426 --> 00:24:29,639
What I want to know is, do many of your
other robots have feelings like this?

201
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:35,645
Must be something in the pathways.

202
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,028
So then, will you be wanting a refund
or a replacement?

203
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:47,616
Neither. I just wanted to get
your reaction to Andrew.

204
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:51,119
I want to know what you think.
He's unique, wouldn't you say?

205
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:52,871
It is an anomaly.

206
00:24:55,498 --> 00:24:57,334
No refund. No replacement.

207
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,545
How much do you want?

208
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:04,466
I don't think I understand.

209
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:09,221
Clearly you realise if word of this gets out,
we'll have to recall our entire line.

210
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:13,016
We're in people's homes, sir,
with their children.

211
00:25:13,225 --> 00:25:16,269
If it is doing what you say,
it can also run amuck.

212
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:19,356
One is not qualified to run mucks.

213
00:25:21,024 --> 00:25:24,277
All right, sir. If I let you have Andrew,
you'll what?

214
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:26,530
You'll disassemble him, will you?

215
00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:33,036
Carefully, yes. We would need to trace
the course of Andrew's neural pathways...

216
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:36,498
...replace the positronic brain and...

217
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:38,375
...put it...

218
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:42,546
...him back together
and return him to you good as new.

219
00:25:44,214 --> 00:25:47,133
Now, these neural pathways are
presumably fragile.

220
00:25:47,342 --> 00:25:50,095
Isn't it possible,
in the course of these procedures...

221
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:52,305
...that something might go wrong?

222
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,017
We would make every conceivable effort.

223
00:25:56,643 --> 00:26:01,273
In the unlikely event that something did go
wrong you'd, of course, replace Andrew.

224
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:02,566
Of course.

225
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,653
Even though he's unique and irreplaceable.

226
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:10,532
"He." "His."

227
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:16,288
It's a natural error. It has human form,
therefore you...

228
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:20,792
...read mechanical failure
as eccentricity and anthropomorphise it.

229
00:26:22,627 --> 00:26:26,798
It is a household appliance
and yet you act like it is a man.

230
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,551
We're leaving. Come on, Andrew.

231
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:32,304
Please, I beg you to reconsider, Mr. Martin.

232
00:26:32,387 --> 00:26:35,807
Let us examine Andrew.
Talk to your wife. Name your price!

233
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:38,685
Now listen to me.

234
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:41,188
There is no price for individuality.

235
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:43,815
He is for better or for worse, my robot...

236
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:48,236
...and you'll never lay your hands on him.
Do you understand?

237
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,948
All in good time.

238
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:55,660
You see sooner or later,
you'll have to bring it in for repairs.

239
00:27:03,376 --> 00:27:05,587
I've made a decision.
Yes, Sir?

240
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:07,797
You will cut back on your workload.

241
00:27:07,881 --> 00:27:11,801
You can no longer devote yourself
entirely to children and housework.

242
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:16,389
But one likes the children, Sir.
Specifically, the smaller one, Little Miss.

243
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:20,602
That is a contradiction and it is exactly
the sort of thing you need to learn.

244
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:22,729
Thank you for choosing
North Am Robotics.

245
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:25,106
We need a new regimen.
Regimen, Sir?

246
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:29,110
First of all, you'll spend part of
each day making something.

247
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:33,949
So as not to offend humans, we'll find
something that's not overly artistic.

248
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:37,202
Could you make other things?
I can teach you my line of work.

249
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:38,828
Timepieces and clocks.

250
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:41,957
One could not tell you.
One has never attempted such things.

251
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,291
You will now.

252
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:48,171
Also, you'll spend part of each evening
in instruction with me.

253
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,423
What is the purpose of this instruction?

254
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:54,803
To teach you all the things
that haven't been programmed into you.

255
00:27:58,098 --> 00:27:59,349
You're unique.

256
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:00,976
Unique?

257
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,019
Thank you for choosing
North Am Robotics.

258
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:07,524
I feel a responsibility to help you
become whatever you're able to be.

259
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:09,526
And what is one able to be?

260
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:11,736
Well, I don't know.

261
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,072
People grow through time.

262
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:18,326
But for you, time is a completely
different proposition.

263
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:21,872
For you, time is endless.
Endless?

264
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:34,259
Is this a good piece?
Very.

265
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:45,145
What about this one?
Excellent.

266
00:29:23,308 --> 00:29:26,728
...and nine months later a baby is born.

267
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:32,442
And those, Andrew,
are the so-called facts of life.

268
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,113
People actually do this, Sir?

269
00:29:38,698 --> 00:29:39,533
Yes.

270
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:41,493
And married people.

271
00:29:41,785 --> 00:29:46,289
One supposes they see it as some
kind of requirement or obligation.

272
00:29:47,457 --> 00:29:50,877
Well, it's not exactly an obligation.

273
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:52,838
That's a relief.

274
00:29:52,963 --> 00:29:57,050
And it is the natural and preferable way
to conceive children.

275
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:58,176
Sir?

276
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,680
Of all these millions of sperm,
only one makes it?

277
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:04,432
That's true.

278
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:07,018
What happens to the others?

279
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:10,605
They die.

280
00:30:11,064 --> 00:30:12,148
They die?

281
00:30:14,317 --> 00:30:16,069
One feels badly for them.

282
00:30:17,404 --> 00:30:18,655
Well, one does.

283
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:21,908
It's agreed that it feels good.

284
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,911
For both parties, Sir?
In an ideal world.

285
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:27,247
People do it frequently.

286
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:28,623
How often, Sir?

287
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:31,251
As often as they can, as a matter of fact.

288
00:30:33,795 --> 00:30:35,255
At least at first.

289
00:30:38,758 --> 00:30:39,593
Sir?

290
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,014
May one speak frankly with you?
As always, Andrew.

291
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:47,934
It's just that the whole process...

292
00:30:48,852 --> 00:30:51,229
...it sounds so messy.

293
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:56,026
I think that's a fair comment.

294
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,741
They die.

295
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:41,196
It's called humour.

296
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,323
Humour?

297
00:31:44,074 --> 00:31:46,701
People tell jokes to make each other laugh.

298
00:31:47,577 --> 00:31:50,247
And this laughter gives pleasure, Sir?
Yes.

299
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:55,168
Could you teach one to tell a joke?

300
00:31:58,338 --> 00:31:59,589
Let's see...

301
00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:03,635
Two drunks walk into a bar...

302
00:32:03,844 --> 00:32:06,721
Wouldn't two drunks
walk out of a bar, Sir?

303
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:11,101
You walk into a bar to drink,
and you come out drunk.

304
00:32:12,894 --> 00:32:17,399
Let's try something simpler, Andrew.
Knock-knock.

305
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:20,777
Knock-knock.

306
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:23,530
No. Knock-knock, someone's at the door.

307
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:25,323
Shall one get it, Sir?

308
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:28,451
No, you say, "Who's there?" Andrew.

309
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,955
"Who's there, Andrew?"
No. Just, "Who's there?"

310
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:33,748
One does not know, Sir.

311
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:38,253
We'll start with something a little simpler.

312
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:41,214
Why did the chicken cross the road?

313
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:44,634
One does not know. Possibly a predator
was behind the chicken.

314
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,263
Or possibly there was a female chicken
on the other side of the road...

315
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:51,725
...if it was a male chicken or,
depending on the season...

316
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:55,187
...it might be migrating.
One hopes there's no traffic.

317
00:32:55,729 --> 00:32:57,856
To get to the other side.

318
00:32:58,815 --> 00:33:00,650
"To get to the other side."

319
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:05,113
Why is that funny?

320
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:10,785
What do you kids have planned for today?

321
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:13,288
I'll probably stick around
with Andrew today.

322
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:14,664
What about you?

323
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:17,250
I'm going to go play
at my friend Natalie's house.

324
00:33:20,337 --> 00:33:23,298
May one, Sir? Is now a good time?

325
00:33:25,258 --> 00:33:27,135
What? A good time for what?

326
00:33:27,677 --> 00:33:31,264
Last night, Sir taught...
No. Don't blame me, just go ahead.

327
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:33,058
Thank you, Sir.

328
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:38,688
Two cannibals were eating a clown.
One says, "Does this taste funny to you?"

329
00:33:38,772 --> 00:33:41,441
How do you make a hanky dance?
Put a little boogie in it.

330
00:33:41,525 --> 00:33:43,902
What's a brunette between two blondes?
Translator.

331
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:46,446
Why don't the blind skydive?
It scares their dogs.

332
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:50,033
A man with dementia is driving on
the freeway. His wife calls and says:

333
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:52,452
"I heard there's someone driving
the wrong way."

334
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:54,204
He says, "One? There's hundreds!"

335
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:57,499
What's silent, smells like worms?
Bird farts.

336
00:33:57,958 --> 00:34:00,252
An engineer must have designed
the human body.

337
00:34:00,335 --> 00:34:04,256
Who else would put a waste-processing
plant next to a recreation area?

338
00:34:04,506 --> 00:34:07,926
A woman goes to a doctor who says,
"Mind if I numb your breasts?"

339
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:09,970
"Not at all."
"Num, num, num."

340
00:34:13,056 --> 00:34:14,432
One did it, Sir.

341
00:34:15,016 --> 00:34:18,270
It was fine, but we might want
to talk about...

342
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:21,439
...appropriateness and timing.

343
00:34:22,023 --> 00:34:23,400
It's 10:15, Sir.

344
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:43,962
Would you like me to teach you
how to play a duet?

345
00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:45,589
Certainly.
Come on.

346
00:34:49,342 --> 00:34:51,636
Okay, ready? You start here.

347
00:34:52,596 --> 00:34:55,640
And then just follow me. I play first.

348
00:34:56,266 --> 00:34:57,184
Ready?

349
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:06,109
Your turn.

350
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:13,366
Good.

351
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,952
Very good. Now together.

352
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:21,852
That was wonderful. Thanks.

353
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:23,687
Thank you, Little Miss.

354
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:00,140
Hi, Mom.

355
00:37:07,856 --> 00:37:11,985
Grace, is it possible for you to find
somewhere more private to do that?

356
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:16,865
No problem. Give me your credit disk,
and we'll get a hotel room.

357
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,660
What did you say to me?

358
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:21,953
Let's go.

359
00:37:22,621 --> 00:37:24,664
What did you say to me, young lady?

360
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:27,918
You get off that bike this minute,
and you are grounded!

361
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:29,419
Go on, get out of here, you piece of scum!

362
00:37:41,848 --> 00:37:43,308
Does this look right?

363
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:46,353
Hi, Mom.
Didn't you talk to her about that boy?

364
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,563
Well, not yet. But I will.

365
00:37:50,023 --> 00:37:53,777
Kind of hoping it's a phase that'll pass,
like the others.

366
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:09,042
I am so sick of these damned clocks!

367
00:38:10,293 --> 00:38:12,587
I've already given half of them away.

368
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:16,258
Perhaps we should sell them.

369
00:38:16,842 --> 00:38:17,926
Sell them?

370
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:19,553
It's an idea.

371
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,972
Who gets the money?

372
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:24,099
Well, I imagine we will.

373
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,560
But Andrew does all the work.

374
00:38:26,643 --> 00:38:29,479
But Andrew is our...
Then Andrew should get the money.

375
00:38:29,563 --> 00:38:31,022
Andrew is a robot.

376
00:38:31,398 --> 00:38:34,442
What conceivable use would a robot
have for money?

377
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,862
Robots don't go shopping.

378
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:38,655
Robots don't go on vacations.

379
00:38:38,738 --> 00:38:41,449
Robots don't eat dinners
in fancy restaurants.

380
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,371
I can't believe we're having this discussion.

381
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:53,336
It doesn't matter what he is.

382
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:56,339
Andrew deserves to benefit
from the work he does.

383
00:38:58,091 --> 00:38:59,342
Sweetheart...

384
00:39:01,595 --> 00:39:04,639
I will do what's right for Andrew,
of course I will.

385
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:08,852
At the end of the day,
we are talking about a machine.

386
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:12,898
You can't invest
your emotions in a machine.

387
00:39:35,295 --> 00:39:37,923
There you are. How are you?
Good morning.

388
00:39:38,006 --> 00:39:41,593
This must be Andrew.
Andrew, Bill Feingold, family lawyer.

389
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:44,971
You own one of my clocks.

390
00:39:47,182 --> 00:39:50,602
This is one of my favourites.
Do you enjoy it?

391
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:52,979
Yes, I do very much.

392
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,274
I like the new office, Bill.
What floor are we on?

393
00:39:56,358 --> 00:39:57,609
Thirty-seventh.

394
00:39:59,986 --> 00:40:02,280
Andrew, come and have a look at this.

395
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:04,491
No, thank you, Sir.

396
00:40:06,368 --> 00:40:07,452
Sure?
No.

397
00:40:10,205 --> 00:40:11,540
How can I help you?

398
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:15,669
As you know, Andrew has earned a great
deal of money from his endeavours.

399
00:40:16,086 --> 00:40:19,339
And what he really wants
is to open his own bank account.

400
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:22,050
A bank account in the name of a robot.

401
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:23,718
Would that be legal?

402
00:40:24,594 --> 00:40:27,138
I couldn't say. There are no precedents.

403
00:40:27,931 --> 00:40:30,767
I don't think there's a law against it, but...

404
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:35,272
Why do you want to give him a
bank account? What's he need money for?

405
00:40:36,982 --> 00:40:40,485
To pay for things which, otherwise,
Sir would have to pay for.

406
00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:42,946
One would like to pull one's own.

407
00:40:44,614 --> 00:40:45,615
Weight.

408
00:40:46,116 --> 00:40:47,367
For what, Sir?

409
00:40:57,002 --> 00:40:58,503
Yes, Little Miss.

410
00:41:02,716 --> 00:41:03,967
I'm so sorry.

411
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:09,222
Not to worry. It can be repaired.

412
00:41:22,611 --> 00:41:23,445
Left.

413
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:28,033
Remember Frank, my boyfriend?

414
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:30,952
Yes. The one your sister says
has a nice ass.

415
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:40,962
Last night, he asked me to marry him.

416
00:41:43,173 --> 00:41:45,300
One gathers that is a good thing.

417
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:48,678
I haven't said yes yet.

418
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,430
So there is doubt.

419
00:41:50,555 --> 00:41:52,599
No. Frank is wonderful.

420
00:41:52,724 --> 00:41:57,354
He's handsome, he's reliable,
he's somebody I could spend my life with.

421
00:41:57,562 --> 00:42:00,899
I could have children with him.
Then what is the problem?

422
00:42:03,443 --> 00:42:04,361
Board?

423
00:42:04,986 --> 00:42:07,447
No.
Not him. There.

424
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:16,248
I have this friend that's very special to me.

425
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:24,548
And he's just so sweet and funny,
and whenever I'm with him...

426
00:42:26,132 --> 00:42:28,260
...I don't want to be with Frank.

427
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:31,096
One can see that would create
a complication.

428
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,184
But the answer's staring you in the face.

429
00:42:39,104 --> 00:42:40,564
Marry your friend.

430
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,568
What?

431
00:42:45,235 --> 00:42:46,945
Well, he's not...

432
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:54,411
A relationship between us,
it would be impossible, really.

433
00:42:54,494 --> 00:42:56,705
It could never work out.
Why?

434
00:42:57,956 --> 00:42:59,499
Because he's not...

435
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:03,378
Because he'll never be...

436
00:43:05,922 --> 00:43:07,174
Yes?

437
00:43:14,014 --> 00:43:15,515
Is something wrong?

438
00:43:19,144 --> 00:43:20,061
No.

439
00:43:21,438 --> 00:43:23,565
Nothing is wrong. Nothing at all.

440
00:43:24,941 --> 00:43:26,818
Thank you for listening to me.

441
00:43:26,943 --> 00:43:28,820
One is glad to be of service.

442
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,367
Little Miss?

443
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:37,829
What will you do about Frank?

444
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:46,796
Accept his proposal.

445
00:43:47,464 --> 00:43:48,548
Really?

446
00:43:50,509 --> 00:43:51,593
Humans...

447
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:02,979
It would mean so much to me
if you would be an usher at my wedding.

448
00:44:04,648 --> 00:44:07,734
One is unfamiliar with this term.
How does one ush?

449
00:44:08,944 --> 00:44:12,072
You help people to their seats.
You wear a tuxedo.

450
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:16,409
One would wear clothing?

451
00:44:16,952 --> 00:44:17,869
Yes.

452
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:22,207
One has never been asked
to wear clothing.

453
00:44:24,334 --> 00:44:25,919
It would be an honour.

454
00:44:27,546 --> 00:44:28,630
Great!

455
00:44:35,554 --> 00:44:37,264
One still is all thumbs.

456
00:44:43,103 --> 00:44:44,563
Installed what?

457
00:44:46,648 --> 00:44:48,024
An alarm.

458
00:44:48,775 --> 00:44:52,696
If you try to enter Andrew's brain
while you're making this repair...

459
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,240
...the police will be alerted.

460
00:44:56,449 --> 00:44:58,660
Also, you should probably know that...

461
00:44:58,785 --> 00:45:02,289
...if you injure Andrew's brain
or positronic pathways in any way...

462
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:07,127
...my lawyer, the good Mr. Feingold,
will be happy to sue you.

463
00:45:08,086 --> 00:45:12,966
He will sue you for the lost value of
Andrew's income until the end of time.

464
00:45:15,677 --> 00:45:17,804
I think we understand each other.

465
00:45:18,722 --> 00:45:19,639
Good.

466
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:23,059
Sir, one more item of business.

467
00:45:24,895 --> 00:45:28,398
As long as one is in the shop,
can you do work on one's face?

468
00:45:28,523 --> 00:45:30,734
One wishes to have more expression.

469
00:45:30,817 --> 00:45:34,070
One has thoughts and feelings
that presently do not show.

470
00:45:34,738 --> 00:45:37,991
You want your thoughts and feelings
to show on your face?

471
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:41,620
Yes, like the contempt that you are
showing me right now.

472
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:47,417
We have done some experimentation.

473
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:53,924
We are able to give robots superficial
responses which mimic human expression.

474
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,551
One has read that there have been
NDR upgrades.

475
00:45:56,635 --> 00:45:59,721
Yes, we've worked up
a dozen experimental models...

476
00:45:59,804 --> 00:46:02,974
...with expression capabilities,
sleeker body types.

477
00:46:03,725 --> 00:46:07,646
We ran some market surveys
and decided not to go ahead with the line.

478
00:46:07,729 --> 00:46:08,730
Why not?

479
00:46:09,231 --> 00:46:11,066
Negative consumer reaction.

480
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:16,947
There is a fear that robots will continue
to make the human work force obsolete.

481
00:46:18,657 --> 00:46:22,953
Andrew has worked for me for 15 years.
No one will lose their job to him.

482
00:46:23,328 --> 00:46:27,749
Surely there's no concern performing
these modifications on an old-style robot?

483
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:33,672
True. But procedures like that
would be prohibitively expensive.

484
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:37,133
It is understood that
you will attempt to rivet one.

485
00:46:37,843 --> 00:46:41,263
"Screw," Andrew.
Really? How much?

486
00:46:56,403 --> 00:46:58,697
That is roughly one's monthly salary.

487
00:47:00,991 --> 00:47:03,118
That's more than I make in a year.

488
00:47:04,828 --> 00:47:08,081
Not bad for, what did you call him
last time we were here?

489
00:47:08,206 --> 00:47:09,583
Household appliance.

490
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:12,294
Household appliance?
Household appliance, yes.

491
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,509
May the peace of the Lord
be with you always.

492
00:47:20,886 --> 00:47:23,680
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

493
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:28,101
You may kiss the bride now.

494
00:47:38,778 --> 00:47:43,033
It is my pleasure to present
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Charney.

495
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:07,659
Good evening, Sir.

496
00:49:10,912 --> 00:49:12,622
Magnificent night.

497
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:17,502
You look very sharp this evening, Andrew.

498
00:49:17,919 --> 00:49:19,171
Thank you, Sir.

499
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,591
It was quite challenging for the tailor.

500
00:49:23,466 --> 00:49:26,970
May one continue wearing clothing,
if it suits you?

501
00:49:27,846 --> 00:49:29,222
Are you serious?

502
00:49:29,514 --> 00:49:30,765
As always.

503
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,060
Well, I suppose so.

504
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:38,356
We'll have to find you some other stuff.
You can't wear tails all the time.

505
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:40,692
Really? How sad.

506
00:49:42,485 --> 00:49:45,113
Sit down, Andrew, please.
Thank you, Sir.

507
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,331
It was a wonderful wedding, wasn't it?

508
00:49:54,414 --> 00:49:55,582
Oh, yes, Sir.

509
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:59,628
And, if one may say,
you are a spectacular dancer.

510
00:50:00,587 --> 00:50:01,838
That's very kind.

511
00:50:01,922 --> 00:50:04,049
Not at all, Sir. It's the truth.

512
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:08,345
Did you record the day?

513
00:50:08,762 --> 00:50:11,389
Every second, Sir, is in one's memory bank.

514
00:50:12,182 --> 00:50:14,226
Well, let's watch it, shall we?

515
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,910
Is everything all right?

516
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,171
They've both gone now, Andrew.

517
00:51:26,673 --> 00:51:28,967
Things change. Things always change.

518
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:32,470
People move on, as it should be.

519
00:51:37,976 --> 00:51:40,187
But what I realised today is that...

520
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:45,025
...I'll never stop missing them.

521
00:51:56,494 --> 00:51:57,954
One is still here.

522
00:51:59,915 --> 00:52:02,209
One is glad of that, Andrew.

523
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:04,503
Thank you.

524
00:52:05,378 --> 00:52:07,923
Good night, Sir.
Good night, Andrew.

525
00:52:29,778 --> 00:52:31,821
Lloyd! Come here!

526
00:52:33,281 --> 00:52:37,327
What did I tell you about throwing sand
at people? What did I tell you?

527
00:52:38,203 --> 00:52:39,913
Now apologise to Andrew.

528
00:52:40,205 --> 00:52:42,249
I will not apologise to it.

529
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:43,959
Him.
It!

530
00:52:45,961 --> 00:52:47,045
Sorry.

531
00:52:49,464 --> 00:52:52,300
One understands why some animals
eat their young.

532
00:52:55,136 --> 00:52:56,721
I'm so sorry, Andrew.

533
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,231
Are you all right? You seem very quiet.

534
00:53:09,568 --> 00:53:11,444
How does one obtain freedom?

535
00:53:15,782 --> 00:53:18,618
You wish to leave us?
Not at all, Little Miss.

536
00:53:18,952 --> 00:53:21,788
One merely wishes to be declared free.

537
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:25,000
But why?

538
00:53:25,292 --> 00:53:27,252
You have so much freedom here.

539
00:53:27,335 --> 00:53:29,629
Until one is ordered to do something.

540
00:53:30,297 --> 00:53:33,884
It's been years since anyone's
given you an order.

541
00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:36,970
But you may still request one
to perform tasks.

542
00:53:38,138 --> 00:53:42,350
We ask all the time, but it's a request,
not an order.

543
00:53:47,355 --> 00:53:49,399
That's not enough for you is it?

544
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:54,112
One has studied your history.

545
00:53:55,822 --> 00:54:00,952
Terrible wars have been fought
where millions have died for one idea:

546
00:54:02,162 --> 00:54:03,163
Freedom.

547
00:54:04,372 --> 00:54:08,752
And it seems that something
that means so much to so many people...

548
00:54:09,753 --> 00:54:11,505
...would be worth having.

549
00:54:29,814 --> 00:54:32,359
Would now be a good time
to speak with you?

550
00:54:32,817 --> 00:54:35,278
It's always a good time. You know that.

551
00:54:45,038 --> 00:54:47,415
It is everything in one's bank account.

552
00:54:49,626 --> 00:54:51,419
Why would you want to give me...

553
00:54:51,503 --> 00:54:53,296
To purchase one's freedom.

554
00:54:54,548 --> 00:54:56,132
One wants to be free.

555
00:54:58,134 --> 00:55:02,764
One would still obey the three laws,
and serve you in exactly the same fashion.

556
00:55:03,098 --> 00:55:05,642
The only thing that would change
would be the form.

557
00:55:05,767 --> 00:55:08,061
One would no longer be your property.

558
00:55:09,229 --> 00:55:12,440
You want to leave.
That's what this is about, isn't it?

559
00:55:12,649 --> 00:55:16,319
Not at all, Sir. You are one's family.

560
00:55:16,903 --> 00:55:18,864
Then why ask for this?

561
00:55:22,158 --> 00:55:23,952
I see. You're in on this.

562
00:55:25,245 --> 00:55:27,080
We've talked about it, yes.

563
00:55:27,831 --> 00:55:30,876
So you ordered him to do it and he obeyed.

564
00:55:32,043 --> 00:55:35,005
No. He makes his own decisions.

565
00:55:36,298 --> 00:55:38,425
But you put the idea in his head.

566
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:41,094
No, Father. You did.

567
00:55:41,511 --> 00:55:44,931
You've given him hundreds of books.
It was just a matter of time...

568
00:55:45,056 --> 00:55:48,185
...before he became intrigued
by the idea of freedom.

569
00:55:48,852 --> 00:55:51,229
He learns and grows all the time.

570
00:55:51,521 --> 00:55:54,065
It's because of you,
and Andrew's abilities...

571
00:55:54,191 --> 00:55:57,235
...that he's become every bit
as complex as we are.

572
00:56:13,251 --> 00:56:14,753
Good morning, Sir.

573
00:56:24,054 --> 00:56:26,681
You'll take your check back,
please, Andrew.

574
00:56:27,474 --> 00:56:28,642
Why, Sir?

575
00:56:30,227 --> 00:56:31,811
You are free now.

576
00:56:34,022 --> 00:56:36,233
I must ask you to leave this house.

577
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:39,778
But, Sir, I don't wish to leave.

578
00:56:41,196 --> 00:56:44,533
You wished for freedom.
You must accept the consequences.

579
00:56:46,868 --> 00:56:48,995
Then I will remove my belongings.

580
00:56:52,457 --> 00:56:53,959
Where would you go?

581
00:56:55,877 --> 00:56:59,965
I will look for a residence nearby
so if you ever need anything, Sir...

582
00:57:00,465 --> 00:57:04,553
That will not happen, Andrew. Thank you.
There's no need to be close by.

583
00:57:05,011 --> 00:57:07,305
If you command me not to do this,
I will obey.

584
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:09,140
I command nothing.

585
00:57:10,809 --> 00:57:12,185
You're free.

586
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:18,525
Then, called or uncalled
I am always at your service.

587
00:57:30,954 --> 00:57:33,665
You've stopped referring
to yourself as "one."

588
00:58:56,248 --> 00:58:57,916
A home of my own.

589
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:42,377
I'm in here.

590
00:59:56,183 --> 00:59:57,684
Is something wrong?

591
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,396
He asked for you.

592
01:00:08,111 --> 01:00:09,196
It's time.

593
01:00:18,371 --> 01:00:19,873
The robot's here.

594
01:00:30,217 --> 01:00:31,384
Hello, Miss.

595
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:39,768
How are you, Sir?

596
01:00:41,728 --> 01:00:43,188
I'm dying, Andrew.

597
01:00:45,524 --> 01:00:47,025
Otherwise, I'm fine.

598
01:00:48,985 --> 01:00:50,820
Wonderful to see you again.

599
01:00:51,488 --> 01:00:54,741
I'm very happy to see you, Andrew.
It's been a long time.

600
01:00:54,866 --> 01:00:56,284
Yes, it has, Sir.

601
01:01:00,705 --> 01:01:02,415
I wanted to tell you...

602
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:05,210
...that I was wrong.

603
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,629
You're never wrong, Sir.

604
01:01:08,129 --> 01:01:10,006
Then don't contradict me.

605
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:12,926
You were right to want
your freedom, and...

606
01:01:14,553 --> 01:01:16,596
...I'm glad that you have it.

607
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:19,641
Thank you, Sir.

608
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:28,900
You were very good to us.

609
01:01:30,694 --> 01:01:32,821
It was an honour serving you, Sir.

610
01:01:47,294 --> 01:01:49,254
I want to seek out my own kind.

611
01:01:50,172 --> 01:01:54,718
In order to understand my destiny,
I must know if there is another like myself.

612
01:01:55,302 --> 01:01:58,054
North Am Robotics will not
return my inquiries.

613
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:01,266
Now that you've finally
passed the bar, Lloyd...

614
01:02:01,391 --> 01:02:05,854
...I want you to sue them for information
of the whereabouts of all NDR robots.

615
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:07,981
If you don't mind.

616
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:14,404
The Freedom of Information Act
doesn't quite cover suits by robots.

617
01:02:14,571 --> 01:02:15,572
Not yet.

618
01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:19,618
Mother, I'm a very busy man.
I do not have time to help it...

619
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,537
...pursue some ridiculous lawsuit.

620
01:02:23,246 --> 01:02:25,999
Lloyd, sweetheart, I do love you.

621
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:29,461
But sometimes I have to wonder
if you really are my child.

622
01:02:29,544 --> 01:02:31,755
Well, that's mutation, Mother.

623
01:02:32,047 --> 01:02:34,174
The miracle of genetics is: I'm not you.

624
01:02:34,299 --> 01:02:37,052
You've always been more like your father.

625
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:39,763
So that's why you divorced him.

626
01:02:41,932 --> 01:02:42,933
Sorry.

627
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:49,439
What would you do if I got the information
on these other NDRs?

628
01:02:49,648 --> 01:02:52,275
I would seek them out.
Each and every one.

629
01:02:53,443 --> 01:02:55,820
So you'd be gone for quite a long time.

630
01:02:56,196 --> 01:02:57,280
Yes.

631
01:02:57,697 --> 01:03:01,034
Several years, if not more,
if my calculations are correct.

632
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:06,206
I'd love to help you.

633
01:03:07,999 --> 01:03:09,709
Did he not breast-feed?

634
01:04:18,153 --> 01:04:19,571
"Dear Little Miss:

635
01:04:20,113 --> 01:04:22,991
"Myjourney is nearing the end
of its tenth year.

636
01:04:23,074 --> 01:04:27,078
"I still have not found any robot
that bears any similarity to myself.

637
01:04:27,871 --> 01:04:31,208
"I have thousands of miles to go,
hundreds of cities to visit...

638
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:34,794
"...so I have not given up hope.
Love, Andrew."

639
01:04:45,597 --> 01:04:50,310
Hello. My last name is Martin.
Get off the field.

640
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,608
"Dear Little Miss:

641
01:05:38,775 --> 01:05:40,819
"Myjourney is nearing its end.

642
01:05:41,152 --> 01:05:45,532
"I've exhausted all possibilities
save for one final ray of hope.

643
01:05:46,116 --> 01:05:49,619
"I've learned of an NDR robot
that has recently been rebuilt...

644
01:05:49,744 --> 01:05:51,788
"...back home in San Francisco."

645
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,434
Thank you.
You're quite welcome.

646
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,350
Is this yours?

647
01:07:36,768 --> 01:07:38,019
Thank you.

648
01:07:39,187 --> 01:07:41,314
I'm looking for Rupert Burns.

649
01:07:41,481 --> 01:07:44,818
You've come to the right place. Come in.

650
01:07:44,985 --> 01:07:46,528
Certainly have.

651
01:07:56,288 --> 01:07:59,040
Do you have a name?
Of course I do.

652
01:07:59,374 --> 01:08:00,542
Galatea.

653
01:08:01,918 --> 01:08:03,086
Galatea.

654
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,214
You have an amazing agility.

655
01:08:07,299 --> 01:08:08,967
You were dancing in the market.

656
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:11,428
Did you like that?
Very much.

657
01:08:13,054 --> 01:08:15,515
Dancing is the sportiest sport.

658
01:08:15,849 --> 01:08:18,393
And we're so much better at it
than humans.

659
01:08:19,186 --> 01:08:21,938
I can't believe I finally found you.

660
01:08:22,647 --> 01:08:24,191
When did you know?

661
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:25,692
Know what?

662
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:28,028
That you were unique?

663
01:08:28,278 --> 01:08:30,238
I knew that right away.

664
01:08:31,406 --> 01:08:32,490
Me, too.

665
01:08:33,825 --> 01:08:37,162
You and I, we're the same.

666
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,752
We have personality.

667
01:08:46,421 --> 01:08:48,715
Is your personality chip turned on?

668
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,134
Isn't yours?

669
01:08:51,843 --> 01:08:52,761
No.

670
01:08:54,262 --> 01:08:55,889
Sucks to be you!

671
01:08:56,223 --> 01:09:01,186
I think personality is much more fun
than intelligence. Don't you?

672
01:09:03,647 --> 01:09:04,981
I think so.

673
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,780
Can I help you?

674
01:09:12,197 --> 01:09:15,408
Your robot is just a standard NDR,
isn't she?

675
01:09:16,326 --> 01:09:18,537
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

676
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,498
Why does she have the ability to dance?

677
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:26,294
Because I put a modified skeletal chip
into her during her rebuild.

678
01:09:27,212 --> 01:09:30,632
How did you do the modification?
My father taught me.

679
01:09:30,924 --> 01:09:33,802
He created the android unit
at North Am Robotics.

680
01:09:33,927 --> 01:09:37,848
He created the technology that allows you
to mimic human expression.

681
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:39,224
What happened to him?

682
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:44,062
North Am laid him off, so we started
this place. I took over when he died.

683
01:09:45,146 --> 01:09:46,565
I'm sorry to hear that.

684
01:09:46,648 --> 01:09:49,526
He would've been absolutely thrilled
to meet you.

685
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,903
I'm Rupert Burns.

686
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,364
It's a real honour.
The honour is mine.

687
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:57,951
You and I, we're the same!

688
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:02,038
Let's get loco, robo!

689
01:10:05,292 --> 01:10:07,335
Shut her off, or I will!

690
01:10:15,093 --> 01:10:16,344
Thank you.

691
01:10:18,221 --> 01:10:19,806
Is this your father's work?

692
01:10:21,057 --> 01:10:25,061
Yeah. It's our work, you could say.

693
01:10:25,687 --> 01:10:29,608
I haven't been able to restrain myself
from continuing to tinker with...

694
01:10:29,691 --> 01:10:33,278
...the relentlessly unfashionable
android technology.

695
01:10:33,403 --> 01:10:36,573
As a matter of fact,
I've actually gotten to a point...

696
01:10:37,532 --> 01:10:42,037
...where I can pretty much exactly replicate
the external physical appearance...

697
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:44,039
...of a human being.

698
01:10:51,338 --> 01:10:52,672
Remarkable.

699
01:10:53,131 --> 01:10:54,382
Thank you.

700
01:10:56,635 --> 01:10:57,802
Amazing!

701
01:10:59,971 --> 01:11:05,018
Unfortunately, nobody seems terribly
interested in funding my research, but...

702
01:11:05,268 --> 01:11:06,269
I am.

703
01:11:09,147 --> 01:11:11,274
I will fund your research.

704
01:11:12,526 --> 01:11:13,527
Yeah?

705
01:11:15,487 --> 01:11:17,030
That'd be cool.

706
01:11:23,411 --> 01:11:24,996
Thank you, darling.

707
01:11:26,414 --> 01:11:30,627
I want to make it very clear
this is an external physical upgrade only.

708
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:33,004
Strictly speaking, you'll feel nothing.

709
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:35,465
None of your internal mechanisms
will be changed.

710
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:37,968
You'll be subject to your positronic brain.

711
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:39,928
Is that clear?
Understood.

712
01:11:41,555 --> 01:11:45,058
Now, have you given
any thought whatsoever...

713
01:11:46,518 --> 01:11:48,979
...as to what age you'd like to be?

714
01:11:49,145 --> 01:11:51,523
Officially, I am 62 years old.

715
01:11:52,858 --> 01:11:55,068
Let's take off 25 years.
15.

716
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:56,736
20.
Perfect.

717
01:12:00,448 --> 01:12:04,661
Believe it or not, the secret to all this
is actually imperfection.

718
01:12:05,537 --> 01:12:06,788
Imperfection?

719
01:12:07,247 --> 01:12:11,418
Things like wrinkles,
less-than-perfect teeth.

720
01:12:12,669 --> 01:12:16,006
Details like fading scars, little pockmarks.
Look at my nose.

721
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:19,968
See my nose?
It's bulbous and slightly irregular.

722
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:21,136
It is.

723
01:12:21,261 --> 01:12:24,097
I'm the only one who has my nose.
That's what makes me me.

724
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:27,767
We must incorporate these features
into your design so that you can be...

725
01:12:27,893 --> 01:12:29,603
...the only one of you.

726
01:12:29,686 --> 01:12:32,689
That's what makes us unique
is those imperfections.

727
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:36,067
I see. Like the shape of your head.

728
01:12:37,861 --> 01:12:39,738
What about the shape of my head?

729
01:12:39,821 --> 01:12:41,072
It's huge.

730
01:12:46,453 --> 01:12:47,787
But lovely.

731
01:12:49,497 --> 01:12:50,749
Thank you.

732
01:13:12,812 --> 01:13:15,190
What happened? What's going on?

733
01:13:18,276 --> 01:13:19,778
What happened?

734
01:13:20,904 --> 01:13:22,697
I saw the inner me.

735
01:14:12,539 --> 01:14:13,707
Is it ready?

736
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:24,509
Please be careful. Don't drop me.
I'm being careful.

737
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:27,262
Oh, my God! Just relax. Relax.

738
01:14:28,555 --> 01:14:30,765
Why did you do that?
That wasn't very funny.

739
01:14:30,891 --> 01:14:32,851
Just keeping you on your toes.

740
01:14:33,018 --> 01:14:36,229
I don't have any toes.
You do now.

741
01:14:38,064 --> 01:14:39,065
I do.

742
01:14:39,774 --> 01:14:41,026
And hands.

743
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:42,819
And fingers!

744
01:14:43,153 --> 01:14:45,697
How do I look?
See for yourself.

745
01:15:18,897 --> 01:15:20,148
Thank you.

746
01:15:53,598 --> 01:15:54,850
Beautiful.

747
01:15:57,269 --> 01:15:58,353
Sorry.

748
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:00,021
Who are you?

749
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:01,690
Andrew.

750
01:16:02,732 --> 01:16:03,733
Andrew?

751
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,487
You look wonderful. Even younger.

752
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:09,739
How do you do that?

753
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:11,491
Do I know you?

754
01:16:12,325 --> 01:16:15,912
I know I look different, too.
I've had an upgrade. Touch it.

755
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,541
Sorry. The face.

756
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,835
What's going on?

757
01:16:22,419 --> 01:16:24,212
You leave her alone!

758
01:16:26,339 --> 01:16:27,924
Who are you?
Andrew.

759
01:16:29,968 --> 01:16:31,344
No. Andrew?

760
01:16:32,095 --> 01:16:34,389
But Andrew's a robot.
Yes, I am.

761
01:16:34,514 --> 01:16:36,224
Well, now an android.

762
01:16:36,308 --> 01:16:37,851
He's had an upgrade.

763
01:16:38,143 --> 01:16:39,519
I know that.

764
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,231
Hello.

765
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:47,277
Hello. It is you!

766
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:53,033
You know him?
Yes.

767
01:16:53,491 --> 01:16:56,536
You know me? Who're you?
I'm Little Miss.

768
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:59,164
That's Little Miss.
No.

769
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,210
No. That's Portia.
Portia?

770
01:17:07,547 --> 01:17:09,674
Who's Portia?
My granddaughter.

771
01:17:10,133 --> 01:17:13,553
Your granddaughter?
Is this some kind of trick?

772
01:17:14,721 --> 01:17:16,223
You're Little Miss?

773
01:17:16,681 --> 01:17:19,059
Then what right do you have
to look like her?

774
01:17:19,184 --> 01:17:22,229
There is and can be only one Little Miss.

775
01:17:22,854 --> 01:17:23,855
Really?

776
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:27,901
It's a genetic resemblance.
Sometimes it skips a generation.

777
01:17:28,151 --> 01:17:30,695
I don't care. I don't like it.
I can see that.

778
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:33,907
If you took a moment,
which I see you're not inclined to do...

779
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:37,077
...you'd realise Portia and I
are very different people.

780
01:17:39,329 --> 01:17:41,456
Why is she imitating you?

781
01:17:42,207 --> 01:17:44,334
What's so funny?
You are.

782
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:46,837
I'm not trying to be funny.

783
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:50,841
Things have certainly changed around here.

784
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:54,511
That happens after 20 years.

785
01:17:56,346 --> 01:17:59,307
I have so much to tell you. Come with me.

786
01:18:03,103 --> 01:18:04,354
It is you.

787
01:18:05,397 --> 01:18:06,314
Yes.

788
01:18:13,029 --> 01:18:15,407
Hello, my friend.
Hello, Little Miss.

789
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:20,203
Whose daughter is she?
Lloyd's.

790
01:18:20,453 --> 01:18:22,497
Now the rudeness makes sense.

791
01:18:44,477 --> 01:18:46,188
Go home to your master.

792
01:18:49,482 --> 01:18:51,860
You don't have a home, do you?

793
01:18:53,737 --> 01:18:56,198
I don't have food. I don't eat.

794
01:19:01,578 --> 01:19:04,539
Come in. We'll keep each other company.

795
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:30,857
I know you don't like me.

796
01:19:30,982 --> 01:19:34,069
I don't like you either.
I just want to make that clear.

797
01:19:34,152 --> 01:19:36,446
Couldn't be more clear
if you spat in my face.

798
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:39,324
I can't. I don't have a mucous gland.

799
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:51,878
Would it be possible
to have a slightly longer conversation?

800
01:19:57,384 --> 01:20:00,053
May my canine companion enter also?

801
01:20:04,391 --> 01:20:05,642
Thank you.

802
01:20:20,574 --> 01:20:22,534
Is this your sculpture?

803
01:20:24,244 --> 01:20:27,205
No, I'm restoring it.
I'm a preservation architect.

804
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:29,916
It's quite horrendous.

805
01:20:31,751 --> 01:20:34,129
How ugly was it before you restored it?

806
01:20:34,754 --> 01:20:37,507
First you get mad at me
because of how I look.

807
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:41,803
Now you show up at my door,
announce that you don't like me...

808
01:20:41,887 --> 01:20:43,847
...and then you criticise my work.

809
01:20:44,014 --> 01:20:47,601
Once again, I apologise for telling the truth
but it can't be helped.

810
01:20:47,684 --> 01:20:49,227
It's my programming.

811
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:53,190
What is it exactly that you want?

812
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:55,233
Family.

813
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:58,904
My last name is Martin.

814
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:02,199
I'm so named because your
great-grandfather and grandmother...

815
01:21:02,282 --> 01:21:04,743
...considered me to be
a member of your family.

816
01:21:05,076 --> 01:21:06,703
Now Sir is dead.

817
01:21:07,204 --> 01:21:08,914
Little Miss is getting older.

818
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:12,834
You don't like me, but you'll talk to me
if I knock on your door long enough.

819
01:21:12,918 --> 01:21:14,461
Is that a joke?
No.

820
01:21:14,544 --> 01:21:16,171
Would you like to hear a joke?

821
01:21:16,254 --> 01:21:20,091
This Buddhist says to a hot dog vendor,
"Make me one with everything."

822
01:21:23,803 --> 01:21:27,557
Andrew, do you have any friends at all?
No.

823
01:21:29,059 --> 01:21:33,605
Only Woofy, who's very sweet, but
not challenging on a conversational level.

824
01:21:35,106 --> 01:21:37,567
That is the extent of his skills.

825
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:40,403
So you want someone to talk to?
With.

826
01:21:40,487 --> 01:21:44,324
Even if that person doesn't like you?
You can't have everything.

827
01:21:45,242 --> 01:21:47,702
Is that right?
Is it, "You can have everything"?

828
01:21:47,786 --> 01:21:50,914
Some people do,
so I'm somewhat confused on that level.

829
01:21:55,085 --> 01:21:56,253
Sit down.

830
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,088
Let's talk.
Thank you.

831
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:07,097
Hey there, handsome.

832
01:22:07,472 --> 01:22:09,683
Could I get you anything to drink?

833
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:12,185
I'm sorry. I have no stomach.

834
01:22:13,687 --> 01:22:16,857
Could I get something for him?
He has a stomach, yes.

835
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:01,276
How is she?

836
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:03,320
She's sleeping.

837
01:23:03,737 --> 01:23:05,238
What happened?

838
01:23:06,072 --> 01:23:07,741
She had a stroke.

839
01:23:43,401 --> 01:23:44,653
There you are.

840
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:48,031
Little Miss.

841
01:24:41,126 --> 01:24:42,377
She's gone.

842
01:24:56,766 --> 01:24:59,811
It's cruel that you can cry and I cannot.

843
01:25:00,896 --> 01:25:03,732
There is a terrible pain I cannot express.

844
01:25:07,986 --> 01:25:10,530
Will every human being that I care for...

845
01:25:12,782 --> 01:25:16,119
...just leave?

846
01:25:21,708 --> 01:25:23,210
I'm afraid so.

847
01:25:27,672 --> 01:25:29,174
That won't do.

848
01:25:34,638 --> 01:25:38,934
This is remarkably impressive.
You did this all by yourself?

849
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:42,938
Yes. I downloaded every known
medical textbook into my memory.

850
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:46,816
I studied them.
That's how I came up with these drawings.

851
01:25:48,193 --> 01:25:52,906
I know they're primitive and not complete.
I need you to fill in the mechanical gaps.

852
01:25:54,199 --> 01:25:56,243
This is another upgrade.

853
01:25:56,493 --> 01:25:58,870
It's considerably more than an upgrade.

854
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:02,457
You're talking about
a profound transition...

855
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:06,002
...from the mechanical to the biological.

856
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:09,965
I realise that. I believe it is
the ideal marriage of both fields.

857
01:26:10,048 --> 01:26:13,385
Not only that,
but this stuff could cut both ways.

858
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:17,681
I don't think that any existing
prosthetic devices hold a candle...

859
01:26:17,764 --> 01:26:19,808
...to what you've designed here.

860
01:26:20,225 --> 01:26:23,478
I mean, you could use these
in human beings as well.

861
01:26:23,937 --> 01:26:25,105
Exactly.

862
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:04,060
What a piece of faecal matter.

863
01:27:04,477 --> 01:27:05,562
"Shit."

864
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:08,148
Excuse me?
What a piece of shit.

865
01:27:08,481 --> 01:27:09,649
I know that.

866
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:12,903
When you're frustrated you say,
"piece of shit."

867
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:17,282
Piece of shit.

868
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,659
Yes, but with feeling.

869
01:27:21,203 --> 01:27:22,829
What a piece of shit.
More.

870
01:27:22,913 --> 01:27:25,290
What a piece of shit!
Good, very good.

871
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:31,963
Are you aware that what you've
essentially designed here...

872
01:27:32,088 --> 01:27:34,049
...is a human central nervous system?

873
01:27:34,132 --> 01:27:36,343
That was my intention, yes.

874
01:27:37,594 --> 01:27:42,807
Well, you got to realise that
a nervous system will radically enhance...

875
01:27:43,058 --> 01:27:46,811
...the way you feel and perceive
the world around you.

876
01:27:47,312 --> 01:27:51,066
I'm not just talking about hot and cold
and little tiny pinpricks.

877
01:27:51,691 --> 01:27:53,318
Put it this way.

878
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:57,280
As your experience becomes varied...

879
01:27:58,031 --> 01:28:04,204
...so will the feelings, emotions,
sensations stimulated by that experience.

880
01:28:05,247 --> 01:28:07,999
And, while some of these
will be very subtle...

881
01:28:09,084 --> 01:28:11,962
...and wonderful, and nuanced,
and shaded...

882
01:28:12,963 --> 01:28:17,092
...others will be profoundly intense
and difficult to tolerate.

883
01:28:20,637 --> 01:28:23,014
Do you feel like you're ready for that?

884
01:28:32,816 --> 01:28:33,984
Absolutely.

885
01:28:42,993 --> 01:28:44,870
Lovely.
Thank you.

886
01:28:45,996 --> 01:28:47,956
I was referring to the statue.

887
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:49,708
I know.

888
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:54,754
Could you fix this piece of shit?

889
01:28:56,256 --> 01:28:58,383
I don't know. Let me take a look.

890
01:29:09,019 --> 01:29:11,897
Andrew, I'm sure
you could restore this yourself.

891
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:14,024
Yes, I could...

892
01:29:15,692 --> 01:29:18,069
...but you could do it much better.

893
01:29:21,156 --> 01:29:23,366
I'd be happy to fix it for you.

894
01:29:23,992 --> 01:29:26,703
If it's not too much effort.
No, not at all.

895
01:29:28,914 --> 01:29:31,917
I've been working all day
and I could use some air.

896
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:35,837
Do you want to go for a walk?
That would be quite splendid. Yes.

897
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,924
Why are you laughing at me?

898
01:29:39,049 --> 01:29:43,678
You're always so polite and so proper.
It's very sweet.

899
01:29:44,346 --> 01:29:45,597
Thank you.

900
01:29:46,806 --> 01:29:49,351
Let's go. Thank you.

901
01:29:52,395 --> 01:29:56,816
"When a man's an empty kettle
he should be on his mettle

902
01:29:57,442 --> 01:30:00,237
"And yet I'm torn apart

903
01:30:00,862 --> 01:30:05,408
"It's because I'm presumin'
that I could be kinda human

904
01:30:05,575 --> 01:30:08,453
"If I only had a heart

905
01:30:09,371 --> 01:30:12,874
"Picture me a balcony..."
Do you have an impact drill?

906
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,544
Over on the rack.
Thank you.

907
01:30:19,631 --> 01:30:20,715
Jesus!

908
01:30:23,385 --> 01:30:28,348
There's a party next week to celebrate
the opening of a building that I restored.

909
01:30:29,349 --> 01:30:32,602
All my friends will be there.
It would be great if you could come.

910
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:34,771
I would love to. Thank you.

911
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:39,234
I think you're letting me win.

912
01:30:47,492 --> 01:30:48,743
Checkmate.

913
01:31:53,934 --> 01:31:57,354
Charles, why don't you go get us a drink?

914
01:32:02,192 --> 01:32:03,443
Thank you.

915
01:33:31,323 --> 01:33:34,993
I never understood the phrase,
"Pearls before swans."

916
01:33:35,493 --> 01:33:37,037
What?
"Swine."

917
01:33:37,454 --> 01:33:39,497
Then the ballet is not "Swine Lake."

918
01:33:39,623 --> 01:33:42,542
Oh, God.
Nobody makes me laugh like you.

919
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:46,171
Laughter is essential for a good friendship.

920
01:33:46,254 --> 01:33:47,589
Yes, it is.

921
01:33:51,801 --> 01:33:54,012
Sometimes I get the feeling that...

922
01:33:56,264 --> 01:33:59,100
...you feel a certain way about us...

923
01:33:59,309 --> 01:34:02,979
...and that you wish your...

924
01:34:05,482 --> 01:34:06,483
What?

925
01:34:07,484 --> 01:34:10,278
I don't know. It's just a little...

926
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:13,365
Having this conversation with...

927
01:34:14,908 --> 01:34:16,159
A robot?
Yes.

928
01:34:17,536 --> 01:34:20,163
I mean, a thing is itself, Andrew.

929
01:34:20,288 --> 01:34:25,085
A tree is a tree. Water is water.
You are a magnificent machine.

930
01:34:26,336 --> 01:34:29,756
No matter how much you change,
that's what you'll always be.

931
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:31,341
No.

932
01:34:31,883 --> 01:34:35,095
I can't believe that, will not believe that.

933
01:34:35,303 --> 01:34:37,848
I realise I am not entirely human.

934
01:34:38,056 --> 01:34:40,767
That's why people don't always like
or understand me.

935
01:34:40,851 --> 01:34:42,686
I like you.
You do?

936
01:34:42,894 --> 01:34:45,814
I even understand you some of the time.

937
01:34:46,690 --> 01:34:50,819
But I can't invest my emotions
in a machine.

938
01:34:56,992 --> 01:34:59,119
It must be a genetic trait.

939
01:35:03,582 --> 01:35:05,208
Things change, Portia.

940
01:35:06,918 --> 01:35:08,795
Things always change.

941
01:35:15,844 --> 01:35:17,554
She laughed at me.

942
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:20,557
"A thing is itself, Andrew. Water is water."

943
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:25,020
What about ice? What about steam?

944
01:35:25,270 --> 01:35:27,105
Andy, you got to calm down.

945
01:35:28,148 --> 01:35:30,692
Do you know what it's like
to be laughed at?

946
01:35:30,817 --> 01:35:33,445
Humiliating. It's an abomination.

947
01:35:34,821 --> 01:35:37,657
Look at me. Look what I'm doing here.

948
01:35:38,283 --> 01:35:42,370
I'm trying to make something of myself.
I'm trying to fulfil my destiny.

949
01:35:42,454 --> 01:35:43,788
Does she notice?

950
01:35:44,706 --> 01:35:49,085
I don't want you to take this personally,
but I have to work now. Good night.

951
01:35:58,595 --> 01:36:01,139
Where have you been?
I've been trying to call you.

952
01:36:01,223 --> 01:36:02,766
Poke me in the eye.
What?

953
01:36:02,849 --> 01:36:04,809
Poke me in the eye!
You're crazy.

954
01:36:04,935 --> 01:36:06,728
Poke me in the eye!

955
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:10,607
That hurts!

956
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,778
It works!
What the hell's going on?

957
01:36:14,903 --> 01:36:18,240
It's my neural net!
I'm the proud owner of a nervous system.

958
01:36:18,365 --> 01:36:20,492
You can feel.
Yes, very much!

959
01:36:21,159 --> 01:36:24,496
Do something for me? Perform
an experiment for the sake of science.

960
01:36:24,579 --> 01:36:26,081
All right.
Kiss me.

961
01:36:28,959 --> 01:36:30,460
No, not there.

962
01:36:31,253 --> 01:36:32,254
Here.

963
01:36:39,678 --> 01:36:40,929
Thank you.

964
01:36:42,514 --> 01:36:45,225
Could you feel it?
It's wonderful.

965
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:49,271
It's everything they say it is.

966
01:36:51,189 --> 01:36:52,357
And you?

967
01:36:59,239 --> 01:37:00,699
What's wrong?

968
01:37:03,243 --> 01:37:05,537
Charles and I are getting married.

969
01:37:12,836 --> 01:37:14,504
He's a lucky man.

970
01:37:15,672 --> 01:37:19,259
Congratulations to the both of you.
Goddamn it, Andrew!

971
01:37:19,968 --> 01:37:23,972
If you're going to succeed
at this thing you're trying to do...

972
01:37:24,139 --> 01:37:26,683
...you've got to stop being
so damn deferential.

973
01:37:26,808 --> 01:37:30,145
I can't help being deferential. It's built-in.
Then change.

974
01:37:30,312 --> 01:37:32,606
Change? I have changed.

975
01:37:33,023 --> 01:37:35,942
I don't mean on the outside.
Change on the inside.

976
01:37:36,234 --> 01:37:38,445
Take chances, make mistakes.

977
01:37:38,528 --> 01:37:43,033
Sometimes it's important not to be perfect.
It's important to do the wrong thing!

978
01:37:43,158 --> 01:37:44,951
Do the wrong thing?
Yes.

979
01:37:45,535 --> 01:37:48,079
Why? I see. To learn from your mistakes.

980
01:37:48,205 --> 01:37:49,915
No. To make them!

981
01:37:49,998 --> 01:37:53,668
To find out what's real and what's not,
to find out what you feel.

982
01:37:54,669 --> 01:37:56,713
Human beings are terrible messes.

983
01:37:56,838 --> 01:37:58,673
I'll grant you that.

984
01:38:00,008 --> 01:38:03,929
I see. This is what is known as
an irrational conversation, isn't it?

985
01:38:04,888 --> 01:38:06,932
This is a human conversation.

986
01:38:07,098 --> 01:38:10,852
It's not about being rational.
It's about following your heart.

987
01:38:11,978 --> 01:38:14,272
And that's what I should do?
Yes.

988
01:38:14,564 --> 01:38:16,691
And you have a heart, Andrew.

989
01:38:16,858 --> 01:38:21,196
I feel it. I don't even believe it sometimes,
but I do feel it.

990
01:38:22,989 --> 01:38:25,200
And in order to follow that heart...

991
01:38:29,079 --> 01:38:31,122
...one must do the wrong thing.

992
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:32,457
Yes.

993
01:38:37,879 --> 01:38:39,130
Thank you.

994
01:39:14,082 --> 01:39:17,836
Could you be a little more careful?
That's very delicate equipment.

995
01:39:23,258 --> 01:39:24,342
Sorry!

996
01:39:25,177 --> 01:39:26,428
What are you doing?

997
01:39:26,511 --> 01:39:29,055
Near as I can tell, your bitch work!

998
01:39:29,556 --> 01:39:30,640
My what?

999
01:39:30,765 --> 01:39:33,768
You heard me, and I'm sick of it!

1000
01:39:34,269 --> 01:39:37,522
All day long it's, "Yes, Rupert, sir,"
"No, Rupert, sir."

1001
01:39:37,606 --> 01:39:41,443
"Would you like another beverage,
Rupert, sir?" And it chaps my ass!

1002
01:39:42,235 --> 01:39:44,779
So here's a helpful hint for you.

1003
01:39:45,739 --> 01:39:48,200
Shut up, and let me do my work!

1004
01:40:06,384 --> 01:40:07,552
I'm done.

1005
01:40:13,975 --> 01:40:15,519
"Chaps my ass"?

1006
01:40:25,195 --> 01:40:27,739
Where's the chip?
I replaced it.

1007
01:40:29,074 --> 01:40:31,826
She's uncooperative, abusive,
confrontational...

1008
01:40:32,035 --> 01:40:33,870
And a lot more interesting.

1009
01:40:34,204 --> 01:40:36,498
Arguably, but we're not getting
any work done.

1010
01:40:36,581 --> 01:40:39,793
Please give me
the old personality chip back.

1011
01:40:41,795 --> 01:40:43,839
Fine. She can be perky again.

1012
01:40:44,631 --> 01:40:46,508
"Perky"? She's just a robot...

1013
01:40:46,591 --> 01:40:48,176
I didn't mean it that way.

1014
01:40:50,637 --> 01:40:52,264
I really didn't mean that.

1015
01:40:52,347 --> 01:40:55,517
What's the matter with you today?
Where are you going?

1016
01:41:04,276 --> 01:41:06,653
Aunt Jamie, I want you too meet Charles.

1017
01:41:06,736 --> 01:41:09,281
This is my Aunt Jamie.
Nice to meet you.

1018
01:41:24,504 --> 01:41:26,131
What's going on?

1019
01:41:27,090 --> 01:41:29,384
Portia's parents are giving
an engagement party...

1020
01:41:29,509 --> 01:41:31,887
...that I wasn't invited to
for obvious reasons.

1021
01:41:33,221 --> 01:41:34,681
There he is.
Who?

1022
01:41:34,764 --> 01:41:36,433
The prospective groom.
Where?

1023
01:41:36,516 --> 01:41:40,770
Where? The one in the pale blue suit
with the big pointy chin!

1024
01:41:41,521 --> 01:41:44,733
He's got a pointy chin?
You can put an eye out with that chin!

1025
01:41:45,525 --> 01:41:48,320
That's nothing compared to his teeth.
Look at that!

1026
01:41:48,778 --> 01:41:52,365
I'm amazed he's out in daylight.
Yeah, he's got funny teeth.

1027
01:41:52,616 --> 01:41:54,993
You need to upgrade your eyes.

1028
01:41:55,327 --> 01:41:58,663
That shouldn't stop Portia.
She can marry whoever she likes.

1029
01:41:58,788 --> 01:42:02,876
One day she'll wake up and realise
she's married to a man...

1030
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:06,338
...whose face closely resembles
an antique can opener.

1031
01:42:07,756 --> 01:42:09,508
The kind that used to go...

1032
01:42:09,591 --> 01:42:12,302
The ones that move around,
and the can pops off.

1033
01:42:12,385 --> 01:42:13,970
You're jealous.

1034
01:42:14,513 --> 01:42:16,389
No, I'm not!
You're jealous!

1035
01:42:16,473 --> 01:42:19,809
You are. Otherwise, what're you doing
spying on Portia?

1036
01:42:21,436 --> 01:42:23,313
My God, I am jealous.

1037
01:42:24,731 --> 01:42:27,108
If I'm jealous, that means I'm in love.

1038
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:31,696
If I'm in love, then all hope is gone.

1039
01:42:32,822 --> 01:42:34,324
I've lost her.

1040
01:43:09,484 --> 01:43:11,528
Would you like a sip of my beer?

1041
01:43:12,779 --> 01:43:15,699
It'd be a waste. I could not taste it.

1042
01:43:16,199 --> 01:43:17,909
What if you could?

1043
01:43:18,243 --> 01:43:19,995
That would be exquisite.

1044
01:43:23,915 --> 01:43:27,085
I've come up with a design,
or a modification rather...

1045
01:43:28,253 --> 01:43:33,383
...that if I'm correct, would enable you
to deal with solid foods and liquids.

1046
01:43:34,759 --> 01:43:36,720
And taste?
Taste, too.

1047
01:43:39,097 --> 01:43:43,185
And also, if my schematics are correct...

1048
01:43:45,353 --> 01:43:51,026
...I think I've come up with a method
to make you a complete man.

1049
01:43:52,861 --> 01:43:54,029
Complete?

1050
01:43:54,696 --> 01:43:55,864
Complete.

1051
01:44:04,039 --> 01:44:05,207
Complete?

1052
01:44:05,957 --> 01:44:11,087
Not in a reproductive sense,
of course, but in terms of approximating...

1053
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:17,427
...the physical sensation, you know,
that occurs...

1054
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,807
...friction.
Sexual relations?

1055
01:44:26,853 --> 01:44:29,606
I've always been fascinated by that.

1056
01:44:29,773 --> 01:44:31,107
I mean, curious.

1057
01:44:32,651 --> 01:44:36,571
Because of what they say.

1058
01:44:37,531 --> 01:44:39,199
What do they say?

1059
01:44:41,993 --> 01:44:43,954
That you can lose yourself.

1060
01:44:45,372 --> 01:44:48,208
Everything. All boundaries, all time.

1061
01:44:51,169 --> 01:44:53,630
That two bodies can become so mixed-up...

1062
01:44:55,048 --> 01:44:57,884
...that you don't know who's who
or what's what.

1063
01:44:58,969 --> 01:45:02,973
And just when the sweet confusion
is so intense you think you'll die...

1064
01:45:03,139 --> 01:45:07,060
...you kind of do,
leaving you alone in your separate body.

1065
01:45:08,228 --> 01:45:10,438
But the one you love is still there.

1066
01:45:11,481 --> 01:45:13,149
That's a miracle.

1067
01:45:14,484 --> 01:45:17,028
You can go to Heaven and come back alive.

1068
01:45:19,906 --> 01:45:24,452
Go back, anytime you want
with the one you love.

1069
01:45:28,373 --> 01:45:31,418
And you want to experience that?
Yes, please.

1070
01:45:33,962 --> 01:45:35,130
So do I.

1071
01:46:17,255 --> 01:46:19,716
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

1072
01:46:24,179 --> 01:46:26,056
I didn't expect to see you.

1073
01:46:27,599 --> 01:46:30,060
I remember this place very well.

1074
01:46:30,727 --> 01:46:32,854
This is where your grandmother
was married.

1075
01:46:32,979 --> 01:46:35,774
I wanted it ready for my own wedding.

1076
01:46:36,107 --> 01:46:39,361
So you're not married yet?
No, two weeks from Saturday.

1077
01:46:39,694 --> 01:46:41,363
I'm not too late.

1078
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:44,658
Are you positive you're doing
the right thing?

1079
01:46:44,741 --> 01:46:47,202
Positive.
About getting married?

1080
01:46:47,285 --> 01:46:50,956
I'm never positive about anything.
You could be doing the wrong thing.

1081
01:46:51,081 --> 01:46:53,708
I'm pretty sure I'm doing the right thing.
Great.

1082
01:46:53,875 --> 01:46:55,585
Why is that great?

1083
01:46:55,669 --> 01:46:57,796
You told me to do the wrong thing.

1084
01:46:57,921 --> 01:47:01,007
You aren't doing the wrong thing,
you're doing the right thing.

1085
01:47:01,091 --> 01:47:05,178
You're not following your own advice,
'cause if you were you wouldn't marry him.

1086
01:47:05,262 --> 01:47:08,390
Because I would be doing the right thing.
Precisely.

1087
01:47:09,724 --> 01:47:12,269
In some strange way,
you're starting to make sense.

1088
01:47:12,394 --> 01:47:13,395
Good.

1089
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:18,024
You know what it's like to be in love with
someone who's marrying someone else?

1090
01:47:18,859 --> 01:47:20,318
Someone who's magnificent?

1091
01:47:20,402 --> 01:47:23,989
Someone who walks into a room
and lights it up like the sun?

1092
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,783
Someone who you know is lying to herself?

1093
01:47:28,034 --> 01:47:30,787
Lying?
Convincingly. Very much so.

1094
01:47:31,121 --> 01:47:32,455
About what?

1095
01:47:32,747 --> 01:47:36,668
That you don't love me when I know,
at least in some way, you do.

1096
01:47:38,503 --> 01:47:40,630
And how do you know that?

1097
01:47:41,006 --> 01:47:43,383
I have done everything, inside and out.

1098
01:47:43,633 --> 01:47:46,303
That stuff doesn't matter to me.
Something matters.

1099
01:47:46,386 --> 01:47:48,597
If nothing mattered, you'd love me...

1100
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:51,600
...and not some man whose chin
could sink the Titanic.

1101
01:47:52,309 --> 01:47:54,978
What? See? It's true, isn't it?

1102
01:47:56,313 --> 01:47:57,397
Sorry.

1103
01:47:58,315 --> 01:48:01,484
Does he light you up like this?
Does he make you laugh?

1104
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:04,404
Nobody makes me laugh like this.

1105
01:48:04,529 --> 01:48:07,616
Good. Then admit it.
Admit that you love me.

1106
01:48:12,579 --> 01:48:15,040
Give me one kiss. That's all.

1107
01:48:15,582 --> 01:48:20,086
One quick kiss. Just one kiss
could not jeopardise a glorious marriage.

1108
01:48:21,254 --> 01:48:25,800
It would also explain why your pulse just
jumped from 66 to 102 beats per minute.

1109
01:48:26,218 --> 01:48:29,638
Your respiration is doubled.
You're putting out clouds of pheromones.

1110
01:48:29,763 --> 01:48:33,183
It's not fair to read me like that.
I know. Love isn't fair.

1111
01:48:33,308 --> 01:48:37,145
I'm reading your heart. I'm asking you
to follow it. Begging you.

1112
01:48:38,939 --> 01:48:41,983
Begging is supposed to be humiliating.
I don't care.

1113
01:48:42,067 --> 01:48:43,860
I love you, Portia.

1114
01:48:44,402 --> 01:48:47,030
I loved you the very first moment
I saw you.

1115
01:48:59,835 --> 01:49:02,379
I thought you said a quick kiss.
I lied!

1116
01:49:30,866 --> 01:49:32,242
How do you feel?

1117
01:49:33,785 --> 01:49:34,870
Wonderful.

1118
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:36,788
So do I.

1119
01:49:38,290 --> 01:49:40,166
I guess that's the point.

1120
01:49:45,755 --> 01:49:47,007
What was that?

1121
01:49:47,424 --> 01:49:50,051
It's your stomach growling. You're hungry.

1122
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:57,392
Was that me?
Yes.

1123
01:49:57,475 --> 01:49:59,936
I thought it was you.
No, it wasn't me.

1124
01:50:00,061 --> 01:50:01,146
Really?

1125
01:50:03,023 --> 01:50:04,274
Do you do that?

1126
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:08,028
Sometimes, but quieter than that.

1127
01:50:09,905 --> 01:50:12,532
I'll have to have Rupert make me a muffler.

1128
01:50:23,335 --> 01:50:24,711
It's wonderful.

1129
01:50:25,003 --> 01:50:27,797
It's wonderful,
the taste and the texture both.

1130
01:50:31,551 --> 01:50:32,719
It's marvellous.

1131
01:50:32,802 --> 01:50:36,806
I know this will be my fourth helping,
but may I please have some more?

1132
01:50:38,350 --> 01:50:42,646
Pig. Very smart animal. Obviously
not that smart if it ends up as bacon.

1133
01:50:43,396 --> 01:50:46,816
I feel like I'm eating my way
through the entire food chain.

1134
01:50:47,067 --> 01:50:48,151
Thank you.

1135
01:50:55,158 --> 01:50:56,159
What?

1136
01:50:59,037 --> 01:51:00,497
What's wrong?

1137
01:51:03,124 --> 01:51:04,668
If we're together...

1138
01:51:05,585 --> 01:51:09,089
...you and me, we'll never be accepted.

1139
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:14,094
Because I'm not human.

1140
01:51:18,056 --> 01:51:19,724
That will not do.

1141
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:26,606
I will have to get started.
Started with what?

1142
01:51:29,693 --> 01:51:30,861
The next step.

1143
01:51:31,528 --> 01:51:33,029
I love you.

1144
01:51:38,952 --> 01:51:40,412
Wish me luck.

1145
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:02,184
Andrew Martin. Step forward, please.

1146
01:52:12,235 --> 01:52:13,737
So, Mr. Martin...

1147
01:52:13,987 --> 01:52:18,366
...you would like us to pass a bill
declaring you a human being.

1148
01:52:19,242 --> 01:52:24,122
Yes. Specifically, the ability
to marry a fellow human being.

1149
01:52:24,581 --> 01:52:25,665
I see.

1150
01:52:26,249 --> 01:52:28,293
We have to face the undeniable fact...

1151
01:52:28,418 --> 01:52:31,755
...that no matter how much you may be
like a human being...

1152
01:52:32,297 --> 01:52:34,925
...you are not part of the human gene pool.

1153
01:52:35,509 --> 01:52:38,720
You are outside of it entirely.
You are something else.

1154
01:52:39,513 --> 01:52:41,389
Something artificial.

1155
01:52:42,265 --> 01:52:46,478
Sir, what about all the real people
wading in the gene pool...

1156
01:52:46,937 --> 01:52:50,524
...who are full of prosthetic devices,
many of which I have invented?

1157
01:52:50,649 --> 01:52:53,777
You yourself, sir, have one of my kidneys,
do you not?

1158
01:52:54,778 --> 01:52:58,448
Are you not in some way artificial,
at least in part?

1159
01:52:59,783 --> 01:53:01,243
In part, yes.

1160
01:53:02,452 --> 01:53:04,287
Then I'm human, in part.

1161
01:53:05,789 --> 01:53:07,249
Which part, Andrew?

1162
01:53:08,959 --> 01:53:10,460
This one, sir.

1163
01:53:11,545 --> 01:53:12,629
I see.

1164
01:53:13,213 --> 01:53:14,756
And here?

1165
01:53:17,634 --> 01:53:20,804
It is true, I am still equipped
with a positronic brain.

1166
01:53:20,887 --> 01:53:26,601
And because of that positronic brain
you are, for all accounts, immortal.

1167
01:53:29,604 --> 01:53:30,772
Yes, sir.

1168
01:53:33,108 --> 01:53:36,778
Andrew, society can tolerate
an immortal robot...

1169
01:53:37,863 --> 01:53:40,782
...but we will never tolerate
an immortal human.

1170
01:53:41,491 --> 01:53:45,161
It arouses too much jealousy,
too much anger.

1171
01:53:46,037 --> 01:53:47,497
I'm sorry, Andrew.

1172
01:53:47,664 --> 01:53:51,418
This court cannot and will not
validate your humanity.

1173
01:53:52,836 --> 01:53:55,505
I hereby bring an end to these proceedings.

1174
01:53:56,089 --> 01:54:00,969
It is the decision of this court that
Andrew Martin, from this day forward...

1175
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:05,390
...will continue to be declared a robot.

1176
01:54:07,017 --> 01:54:09,686
A mechanical machine, nothing more.

1177
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:16,693
One is glad to be of service.

1178
01:54:45,430 --> 01:54:47,390
Andrew, I have to tell you...

1179
01:54:48,808 --> 01:54:51,102
...I'm beginning to feel not so sure.

1180
01:54:51,686 --> 01:54:52,771
About us?

1181
01:54:53,647 --> 01:54:54,564
No.

1182
01:54:57,275 --> 01:54:59,486
Next week will be my 75th birthday...

1183
01:54:59,611 --> 01:55:01,571
I know, and you look 50.

1184
01:55:02,531 --> 01:55:04,741
Thank you.
A spectacular 50.

1185
01:55:04,824 --> 01:55:06,368
But I don't feel 50.

1186
01:55:06,576 --> 01:55:09,996
Your body does. Last night was amazing.
What was that called again?

1187
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,624
Shut up and listen to me!
Sorry.

1188
01:55:12,958 --> 01:55:15,627
Don't give me that look,
I'm not ordering you around.

1189
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:17,546
Whatever you say.
Don't be agreeable.

1190
01:55:17,629 --> 01:55:20,257
I'm not being agreeable.
I can be if you want me to.

1191
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:23,844
Goddamn it! I'm trying to tell you
something important here.

1192
01:55:32,102 --> 01:55:34,062
I'm not going to live forever.

1193
01:55:34,813 --> 01:55:36,147
Yes, you will.

1194
01:55:36,565 --> 01:55:38,775
That's why I invented all...
No, no.

1195
01:55:39,276 --> 01:55:41,820
I won't always take your DNA elixirs.

1196
01:55:42,404 --> 01:55:45,031
I won't have all my organs replaced.

1197
01:55:45,323 --> 01:55:47,951
Eventually, I'm going to wear out.

1198
01:55:48,368 --> 01:55:49,870
And I want to.

1199
01:55:51,705 --> 01:55:53,665
Why would you want to leave?

1200
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:59,838
There's an order to things.

1201
01:56:01,548 --> 01:56:05,802
Human beings are meant to be here
for a certain time and then pass on.

1202
01:56:07,137 --> 01:56:08,972
That's what's right.

1203
01:56:10,849 --> 01:56:11,933
I see.

1204
01:56:13,768 --> 01:56:16,313
There's just one problem, Portia.

1205
01:56:17,814 --> 01:56:20,609
I couldn't stand to live without you.

1206
01:56:47,177 --> 01:56:49,721
Andrew, people grow through time.

1207
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:53,767
But then, for you,
time is a completely different proposition.

1208
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:57,145
For you, time is endless.

1209
01:57:08,990 --> 01:57:11,368
There is only one thing to do.

1210
01:57:35,684 --> 01:57:38,311
Galatea, my dear, where are we?

1211
01:57:39,145 --> 01:57:41,439
The transfusion is almost complete.

1212
01:57:41,565 --> 01:57:42,899
Is that so?

1213
01:57:44,985 --> 01:57:47,362
Just goes to show you, Andrew.

1214
01:57:48,655 --> 01:57:50,782
Somebody becomes a human being...

1215
01:57:51,241 --> 01:57:54,578
...sooner or later,
they do something monumentally stupid.

1216
01:57:55,495 --> 01:57:57,789
You've been a great example, Rupert.

1217
01:57:58,582 --> 01:58:01,251
How quickly will the blood
degrade my system?

1218
01:58:01,751 --> 01:58:03,170
I don't know.

1219
01:58:04,004 --> 01:58:08,258
You exercise, eat right, say, 30, 40 years.

1220
01:58:10,844 --> 01:58:15,098
That's a little vague, chief.
You don't know exactly how long I'll last?

1221
01:58:16,057 --> 01:58:17,142
Sorry.

1222
01:58:19,603 --> 01:58:21,563
Welcome to the human condition.

1223
01:58:31,823 --> 01:58:33,325
Andrew Martin?

1224
01:58:47,214 --> 01:58:50,300
I've always tried to make sense of things.

1225
01:58:51,384 --> 01:58:54,971
There must be some reason I am as I am.

1226
01:58:57,516 --> 01:59:02,646
As you can see, Madam Chairman,
I am no longer immortal.

1227
01:59:05,482 --> 01:59:07,609
You have arranged to die?

1228
01:59:08,068 --> 01:59:09,861
In a sense, I have.

1229
01:59:11,947 --> 01:59:16,201
I am growing old
and my body is deteriorating.

1230
01:59:18,161 --> 01:59:22,707
And, like all of you,
it'll eventually cease to function.

1231
01:59:25,836 --> 01:59:28,964
As a robot I could have lived forever.

1232
01:59:32,551 --> 01:59:36,638
But I tell you all today
I would rather die a man...

1233
01:59:38,265 --> 01:59:41,476
...than live for all eternity as a machine.

1234
01:59:45,814 --> 01:59:47,649
Why do you want this?

1235
01:59:49,901 --> 01:59:54,155
To be acknowledged
for who and what I am...

1236
01:59:55,699 --> 01:59:57,492
...no more, no less...

1237
01:59:59,369 --> 02:00:01,997
...not for acclaim, not for approval...

1238
02:00:03,623 --> 02:00:06,293
...but the simple truth of that recognition.

1239
02:00:07,377 --> 02:00:10,881
This has been the elemental drive
of my existence.

1240
02:00:11,798 --> 02:00:13,633
And it must be achieved...

1241
02:00:13,884 --> 02:00:17,971
...if I am to live or die with dignity.

1242
02:00:31,776 --> 02:00:33,653
What you're asking for is...

1243
02:00:35,363 --> 02:00:38,033
...extremely complex and controversial.

1244
02:00:39,201 --> 02:00:41,661
It will not be an easy decision.

1245
02:00:42,537 --> 02:00:44,497
I must ask for your patience...

1246
02:00:44,956 --> 02:00:48,001
...while I take the necessary time
to make a determination...

1247
02:00:48,084 --> 02:00:51,505
...of this extremely delicate matter.

1248
02:00:54,591 --> 02:00:57,719
Then I await your decision,
Madame Chairman.

1249
02:01:02,516 --> 02:01:04,809
Thank you for your patience.

1250
02:01:09,481 --> 02:01:10,649
We tried.

1251
02:01:25,372 --> 02:01:26,790
Is it almost time?

1252
02:01:27,958 --> 02:01:29,417
In a few minutes.

1253
02:01:31,837 --> 02:01:34,548
It doesn't matter what
the World Congress says.

1254
02:01:35,841 --> 02:01:38,301
Why do you need their approval?

1255
02:01:39,177 --> 02:01:40,428
Old habit.

1256
02:01:41,805 --> 02:01:46,935
I started my existence as a robot.
I still like to be told certain things.

1257
02:01:56,236 --> 02:01:57,487
It's time.

1258
02:02:02,409 --> 02:02:03,785
Ladies and gentlemen...

1259
02:02:03,869 --> 02:02:07,080
...Miss Marjorie Botha,
President of the World Congress.

1260
02:02:07,539 --> 02:02:10,750
According to records of
the North Am Robotics company...

1261
02:02:11,042 --> 02:02:14,087
...the robot, also known as
Andrew Martin...

1262
02:02:14,504 --> 02:02:19,301
...was powered up at 5:15 p.m.
on April 3, 2005.

1263
02:02:20,927 --> 02:02:24,264
In a few hours, he will be 200 years old...

1264
02:02:25,307 --> 02:02:29,686
...which means with the exception of
Methuselah and other biblical figures...

1265
02:02:30,812 --> 02:02:34,900
...Andrew is the oldest living human being
in recorded history.

1266
02:02:35,734 --> 02:02:40,155
By this proclamation,
I validate his marriage to Portia Charney...

1267
02:02:40,655 --> 02:02:43,116
...and acknowledge his humanity.

1268
02:03:11,186 --> 02:03:13,021
I'm sorry he didn't see it.

1269
02:03:15,690 --> 02:03:17,734
Maybe he didn't need to.

1270
02:03:23,615 --> 02:03:25,659
Could you do me a favour?

1271
02:03:28,745 --> 02:03:31,039
Would you mind unplugging me?

1272
02:03:36,002 --> 02:03:37,629
That's an order.

1273
02:04:11,371 --> 02:04:13,164
Thank you, Galatea.

1274
02:04:14,916 --> 02:04:17,836
As the great Andrew Martin used to say:

1275
02:04:18,670 --> 02:04:21,131
"One is glad to be of service."

1276
02:04:39,733 --> 02:04:41,193
See you soon.
