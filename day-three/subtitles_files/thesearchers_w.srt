1
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,040
Ethan?

2
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,180
Quiet, prince.

3
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,240
That's your uncle Ethan.

4
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,090
Welcome home, Ethan.

5
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,190
Lucy. You ain't much bigger
than when I last saw you.

6
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,780
I'm Deborah.
There's Lucy over there.

7
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,610
Deborah. Debbie.

8
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,620
- And you're Lucy?
- Yeah, I'm Lucy.

9
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,870
I'm mighty glad to see you,
uncle Ethan.

10
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,410
She's got a fella. Kisses him too.

11
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,290
- Ben, would you...?
- That's enough.

12
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,290
Go on with Lucy
and help with supper.

13
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,050
Deborah, you too. Ben.

14
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,760
I was just gonna ask uncle Ethan
what he's gonna do with his saber.

15
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,930
Well, I kind of figured to give it to you.

16
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,270
Thanks. Thanks, uncle Ethan.

17
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,770
- How was California?
- California? How should I know?

18
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,110
- Well, Mose Harper told us...
- Mose Harper?

19
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,150
Is that old goat still creaking around?

20
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,660
Why ain't somebody bury him?

21
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,490
No, I ain't been to California.

22
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,580
Don't intend to go either.

23
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,120
Supper will be ready
as soon as you wash up.

24
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,170
Let me take your coat for you, Ethan.

25
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,180
Welcome home, Ethan.

26
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,640
Thanks, Aaron.

27
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,530
Marty, here's uncle Ethan.

28
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,450
Debbie, sit down.

29
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,960
Evening, uncle Ethan.
Welcome home, sir.

30
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,170
Martin. Martin Pawley.

31
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,090
I'm sorry for being late, aunt Martha.

32
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,090
Uncle Aaron.

33
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,560
Fella could mistake you
for a half-breed.

34
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,650
Not quite. I'm eighth Cherokee.
And the rest is welsh and English.

35
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,900
- At least that's what they tell me.
- Grown some.

36
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,990
It was Ethan who found you,
squalling under a Sage clump...

37
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,030
...after your folks had been massacred.

38
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,330
It just happened to be me.
No need to make more of it.

39
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,250
Thank you, Lucy.

40
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,860
Good night, aunt Martha.

41
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,740
Good night, Martin.

42
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,570
- Uncle Aaron.
- Good night, Martin.

43
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,530
- Good night, uncle Ethan.
- Good night.

44
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,370
Come on, Ben.

45
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,410
Night, ma. Night, pa.

46
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,750
Uncle Ethan,
will you tell us about the war?

47
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,960
The war ended three years ago, boy.

48
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,880
It did? Then why didn't you
come home before now?

49
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,380
Ben, go on with Martin. March.

50
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,310
Uncle Ethan, Lucy's wearing
the gold locket you gave her...

51
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,060
...when she was a little girl.

52
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,150
She don't wear it much on account
of it makes her neck green.

53
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,400
- Deborah.
- Well, it does.

54
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,400
But I wouldn't care
if you gave me a gold locket...

55
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,570
...if it made my neck green or not.

56
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,570
- A gold locket.
- Debbie.

57
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Lucy, where are my saddlebags?

58
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,010
Look at my gold locket!

59
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,600
Oh, it is pretty.

60
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,980
- Ethan, I think she's too young...
- oh, let her have it.

61
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,190
- It doesn't amount to much.
- Bed, young lady.

62
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,190
- Yes, daddy.
- Thank you, uncle Ethan.

63
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,860
Come along to bed.

64
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,700
Passed the Todd place coming in.
What happened?

65
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Gave up, quit,
went back to chopping cotton.

66
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,250
So did the Jamisons.

67
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,380
Without Martha...

68
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,550
She just wouldn't let a man quit.

69
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,010
Ethan, I saw it in you before the war.

70
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,720
You wanted to clear out.

71
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,180
You stayed beyond any real reason.
Why?

72
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,060
- Aaron, please...
- you asking me to clear out now?

73
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,650
You're my brother, Ethan.
You're welcome to stay...

74
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,400
...as long as you have a mind to.
That right, Martha?

75
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,900
- Of course it is.
- I expect to pay my way.

76
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,820
There's 60 double eagles in there.

77
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,990
And twice that much here.
Yankee dollars.

78
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,250
That's fresh minted.

79
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,790
- There ain't a mark on it.
- So?

80
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,810
Aaron, open up! It's Sam Clayton.

81
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,890
Aaron.

82
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,570
- Reverend. Come on in!
- Good morning, Aaron.

83
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,490
- Good morning, sister Edwards.
- Good morning, reverend.

84
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,990
- Morning, Ben and Debbie.
- Good morning, Charlie.

85
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,290
- What is it, reverend?
- Lars says somebody...

86
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,330
...busted in his corral last night
and run off his best cows.

87
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,080
Yeah. Next time I raise pigs, by golly!

88
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,750
You never hear anyone
running off pigs, I bet you.

89
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,670
- Coffee's ready if you'd like some.
- Coffee will be just fine. Morning, Lucy.

90
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,260
- Morning, reverend.
- Debbie, you been baptized yet?

91
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,140
- No, sir. No.
- Aaron, get Martin.

92
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,510
- Martin!
- Oh, thank you, sister.

93
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,180
I can sure use that coffee.
Pass the sugar, son.

94
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,020
Fine, fine. Wait a minute, sister.

95
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,860
I didn't get any coffee yet. Just...
oh, doughnuts. Thank you, sister.

96
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,280
I'm sure fond of them doughnuts.

97
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,280
Aaron! Martin, come on up here.

98
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,870
Come on. Raise your right hand...
Martin.

99
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,620
- Yes, sir.
- Raise your right hand.

100
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,830
You are hereby voluntary privates
in company a of the Texas rangers.

101
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,210
- You will faithfully...
- sir, can I go with you?

102
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,960
- Go get my shirt, boy.
- Quiet!

103
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,130
- Where was I?
- "Faithfully fulfill."

104
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,550
- You will faithfully discharge...
- Mrs. Edwards...

105
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,840
shut up!

106
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,390
You will faithfully discharge
your duties as such...

107
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,560
...without a recompense
or monetary consideration.

108
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,400
Amen. That means "no pay."
Better get a shirt on, Aaron.

109
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
I ain't volunteering
till I've had coffee.

110
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,150
- Drink your own, reverend.
- Just call me "captain."

111
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,820
Captain. The reverend
Samuel Johnson Clayton.

112
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,070
Mighty impressive.

113
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,830
Well, the prodigal brother.

114
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,910
When did you get back?
I ain't seen you since the surrender.

115
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,750
Come to think of it,
I didn't see you at the surrender.

116
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,550
Don't believe in surrenders.
Nope, I still got my saber, reverend.

117
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,220
Didn't turn it into
no plowshare neither.

118
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,590
The lnjuns did it, Mrs. Edwards.

119
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,390
Caddos or Kiowas.
Old Mose knows. Yes, sir.

120
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,680
- Oh, shut up, Mose.
- Thank you.

121
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,230
- My cattle's been...
- Ethan, I'm counting on you...

122
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,230
...to look after things
while I'm gone.

123
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,110
- You're not going.
- He sure is going.

124
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,780
- I already swore him in.
- Well, swear him out again.

125
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,070
<i>- I'll</i> go with you.
- I don't think I should...

126
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,570
stay close, Aaron.
It might be this is rustlers.

127
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,870
Might be that this doddering
old idiot ain't so far wrong.

128
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,370
Could be Comanche.

129
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,710
Kind words, Ethan.
Thank you kindly.

130
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,540
Children, go with Lucy.

131
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,040
- Oh, ma, I want...
- Ben.

132
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,130
Comanche, huh?

133
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,960
All right. I'll swear you in.

134
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,300
No need to.
Wouldn't be legal anyway.

135
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,760
Why not? You wanted
for a crime, Ethan?

136
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,730
- Coffee, Ethan.
- Thank you, Martha.

137
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:17,400
You asking me as a captain
or a preacher, Sam?

138
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,480
I'm asking you as a ranger
of the sovereign state of Texas.

139
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,820
- You got a warrant?
- You fit a lot of descriptions.

140
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,160
Figure a man's only good
for one oath at a time.

141
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,830
I took mine
to the confederate states of America.

142
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,790
So did you, Sam.

143
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,330
Stay close, Aaron.

144
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,170
Well, thank you, Mrs. Edwards.
We have to be going.

145
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,300
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.

146
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:47,180
Grateful to the hospitality
of your rocking chair, ma'am.

147
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,190
<i>- Brad and Lucy, Lucy and Brad!
- Brad and Lucy, Lucy and Brad!</i>

148
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,940
Debbie and Ben Edwards,
I'm gonna tell ma on you!

149
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,960
Brad! Right ahead!

150
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,090
Uncle Ethan.

151
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,720
Something mighty fishy
about this trail, uncle Ethan.

152
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,930
Don't call me "uncle."
I ain't your uncle.

153
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,430
Yes, sir.

154
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,400
No need to call me "sir" either.

155
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,400
Nor "grandpa," nor "Methuselah."

156
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,820
I can whup you to a frazzle.

157
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,150
- What do you want me to call you?
- Name's Ethan.

158
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,570
Now, what's so mighty fishy
about this trail?

159
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,990
- Well, first off...
- look! Look!

160
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,510
Reverend!

161
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,850
Look!

162
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,370
Caddos or Kiowas, huh?

163
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,040
Ain't but one tribe uses a Lance like that.

164
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,330
Hey, pa, your prize bull.

165
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,840
Killed every one of them.

166
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,800
Not for food either.
Why'd they do a thing like that?

167
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,840
Stealing the cattle
was just to pull us out.

168
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,720
This is a murder raid.

169
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,390
Shapes up to scald out either
your place or my brother's.

170
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,190
Mama! Laurie!

171
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,060
Oh, please, god, please, no!

172
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,570
Brad! Brad! Son!

173
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,070
Jorgensen's place is the closest, Ethan.

174
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,370
If they're not there, we'll come
straight on to you. Come on, Charlie.

175
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,370
You do that.

176
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,710
Well, are you coming or ain't you?

177
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:50,540
That farm's 40 miles from here, boy,
and these horses need rest and grain.

178
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,930
Ain't Caddos, ain't Kiowas.
Comanches, sure!

179
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:18,530
- Break out the grain.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

180
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,350
Quiet, boy.

181
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,630
Think I'll see if I can't take off
a couple of Sage hens before supper.

182
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,390
Yes, you do that, Aaron.

183
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,020
- My, the days are getting shorter.
- Lucy, we don't need a lamp yet.

184
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,270
Let's just enjoy the dusk.

185
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,500
It's all right, ma. I been watching.

186
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,370
- Only...
- what, Ben?

187
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,880
I wish uncle Ethan was here.
Don't you, ma?

188
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,560
Close that shutter, Ben, like...
good boy.

189
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,370
- Ma, I can't...
- Lucy!

190
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,680
We are going to play
the sleep-out game.

191
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,850
Remember? Where you hide out
with grandma?

192
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,940
- Where she's buried?
- And you creep along the ditch...

193
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,190
- ...very quietly, like...
- like a little mouse.

194
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,440
Hurry up, Martha.
The moon's fixing to rise.

195
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,280
You won't make a sound or come back,
no matter what you hear.

196
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,070
- Promise?
- I promise.

197
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,530
Wait. Can't I have Topsy?

198
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,700
- There's no time. There's no time.
- Here she is, baby.

199
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,130
Here.

200
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,420
Now, down low. Run!

201
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,510
Baby!

202
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,600
Prince, go back. Go back, prince.

203
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,060
Go back. Prince! Go back.
Go back, prince!

204
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,820
Prince, go back. Go back, prince!
Prince!

205
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,560
Uncle Ethan!

206
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Uncle Ethan.

207
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,650
Wait a minute, uncle Ethan.

208
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,360
Next time, you'll mind
your uncle Ethan.

209
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,530
- Thank you kindly.
- Wait, Mose! We can ride double, Mose!

210
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,280
Mose, wait!

211
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,830
Mose!

212
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,570
Martha! Martha!

213
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,780
Aunt Martha.

214
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,030
Aunt Martha.

215
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,950
- Let me in.
- Don't go in there, boy.

216
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,670
- I wanna see them. Let me in, I wanna...
- don't go in.

217
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,090
Don't let him look in there, Mose.

218
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,760
Won't do him any good.

219
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,720
Lucy! Debbie!

220
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,010
- Put an "amen" to it!
- I'm not finished yet.

221
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,760
There's no more time
for praying. Amen!

222
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,930
Brad, Martin!

223
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,020
Amen.

224
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:29,290
Ethan, those girls mean as much to me
as though they were my own.

225
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,210
Maybe you don't know that my Brad's
been sitting up with Lucy. My Laurie's...

226
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,050
I'd be obliged
if you'd come to the point, ma'am.

227
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,390
Just that I know
that Martha would want you...

228
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,970
...to take care of her boys
as well as her girls.

229
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,310
And if the girls are dead, don't let
the boys waste their lives in vengeance.

230
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,020
Promise me, Ethan!

231
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,570
Well, come on, if you're going with us.

232
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,180
Captain! Captain Clayton!

233
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,870
Another one, huh?
Gimme a hand, Charlie.

234
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,130
This one come a long way
before he died, captain.

235
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,970
Well, Ethan, there's another one
you can score up for your brother.

236
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,480
- I don't like it!
- What don't you like?

237
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,230
Injuns on a raid
generally hide their dead.

238
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,820
And if they don't care anything
about us knowing...

239
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,980
...it only spells one thing:

240
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,950
They ain't afeard of us following
or of us catching up with them either.

241
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,910
You can back out
any time you want, Nesby.

242
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,660
Ethan, I didn't say that!

243
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,160
Didn't say such!

244
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,000
Easy, Nesby, easy.

245
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,670
Jorgensen!

246
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,840
Why don't you finish the job?

247
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,940
- What good did that do you?
- By what you preach, none.

248
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,940
But what that Comanche believes...

249
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,610
...ain't got no eyes,
he can't enter the spirit land.

250
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,150
Has to wander forever
between the winds.

251
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,320
You get it, reverend.
Come on, blanket head.

252
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,710
All right, boys. Let's mount up.

253
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,550
They're camped by the river,
about 20 miles from here.

254
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:33,940
We'll wait till dark, then circle out
so we can jump them before daylight.

255
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,070
You right sure you wanna
jump them, Ethan?

256
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,570
That's what we came for, ain't it?

257
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,740
I thought we were trying
to get them girls out. Alive.

258
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,910
We jump them Comanche,
they'll kill them. You know that.

259
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,870
Well, what are we doing, then, reverend?
What are we supposed to do, Ethan?

260
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,920
Well, what I had in mind
was maybe running off their pony herd.

261
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,590
A Comanche on foot's more apt
to be willing to listen.

262
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,880
I think the reverend's right,
don't you?

263
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,550
You think the reverend's...

264
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,600
What does a quarter-breed Cherokee
know about the old Comanche trick...

265
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,600
...of sleeping with his best pony
tied right by his side?

266
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:19,190
You got about as much chance
of stampeding that herd as...

267
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,280
as you have of finding them girls alive
by raiding into them.

268
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,030
I say we do it my way, Ethan.
And that's an order.

269
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,870
Yes, sir.

270
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,620
But if you're wrong...

271
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,290
...don't ever give me another!

272
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,830
- Well, they was here.
- Sure. They was here.

273
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,920
And now they're out there,
waiting to jump us.

274
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,340
Any more orders, captain?

275
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:29,760
Yes. We'll keep on going.

276
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,520
Well?

277
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,940
You wanna quit, Ethan?

278
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,690
That'll be the day.

279
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
- Horses.
- Horses.

280
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,380
Keep on going...

281
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,510
keep moving. Keep moving.

282
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,590
Well, reverend, looks
like you got yourself surrounded.

283
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,800
Yeah, and I figure on getting myself
un-surrounded.

284
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,300
Mose, how far is the river?

285
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:39,560
I've been baptized, reverend.
I've been baptized.

286
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,440
- Shut up, you old fool.
- Thank you kindly. Thank you.

287
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,110
You better get yourself
set for another one...

288
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:51,820
...because when I holler, I want you
to move out of here like Billy B. Jigger.

289
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,120
Let's go!

290
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,110
- Take it easy, Nesby.
- You'll be all right, Nesby.

291
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,660
- Keep them on the other side of the river.
<i>- I'll</i> do the telling, Ethan!

292
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,660
Well, then tell them!

293
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,500
- Take it easy, Nesby.
- You'll be all right, Nesby.

294
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,670
Come on, come on.

295
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,070
There.

296
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,740
Here's my Bible. Hold it.

297
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,290
Make you feel good.

298
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,580
Thank you, reverend.
Thank you very kindly.

299
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,500
Ethan, you figure they'll charge us?

300
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,220
- Are you asking me?
- I am.

301
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,010
Thank you.

302
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,010
Yep. Death song.

303
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,310
War chief, he's gotta, to save face.

304
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,940
Yes, sir. He'll be right in your lap
in a minute, Sonny.

305
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,900
For that which we are about to receive,
we thank thee, O lord.

306
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,980
You got him, Marty!

307
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,790
Hallelujah!

308
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,840
Dag blast it!

309
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,420
Watch it. It's loaded.

310
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,290
No, Ethan. Leave them
carry off their hurt and dead.

311
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,880
Well, reverend, that tears it!

312
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,800
From now on,
you stay out of this, all of you.

313
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,880
I don't want you with me.

314
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,930
I don't need you
for what I gotta do.

315
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,400
Well, Edwards, I...

316
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,030
I guess you're right.
We gotta get Nesby back.

317
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,240
It's a job for a whole company
of rangers...

318
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:06,070
...or it's a job for one or two men.

319
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,540
Right now, we're too many
and not enough.

320
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,500
Me, I'm going on alone.

321
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,920
- Any objections?
- Good luck.

322
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,590
There's only one way you can stop me
from looking for Lucy, mister.

323
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,760
And that's kill me!

324
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,680
That's the way I feel, uncle Ethan.

325
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,600
Ethan, sir.

326
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,930
All right.
But I'm giving the orders, hear?

327
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,940
I'm giving the orders.

328
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,110
And you'll follow them
or we're splitting up right here and now.

329
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,190
Well, sure, Ethan.

330
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,110
Just one reason we're here, ain't it?
That's to find Debbie and Lucy?

331
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,700
If they're still alive.

332
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,920
Mount up.

333
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,570
They gotta stop sometime.

334
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,660
If they're human men at all,
they gotta stop!

335
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:36,250
No. Human rides a horse until it dies,
then he goes on afoot.

336
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:41,840
Comanche comes along, gets that
horse up, rides him 20 more miles...

337
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,170
...then eats him.

338
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,510
Easy on that.

339
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,340
Sorry.

340
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,510
We don't even know
if Debbie and Lucy's in this bunch.

341
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,180
- Maybe they split up.
- They're with them, all right...

342
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:57,350
- ...if they're still alive.
- You've said that enough!

343
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,690
Maybe Lucy's dead.
Maybe they're both dead.

344
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,190
But if I hear that from you again,
I'll fight you, Mr. Edwards!

345
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,780
That'll be the day.

346
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,200
Spread out.

347
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,670
Found a main trail...

348
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,180
...but four of them cut out right here and
they rode on up through the pass there.

349
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,640
How come they do that, Ethan?

350
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,180
I'll take a look.
Keep after the others.

351
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:41,230
- You want us to fire a shot, just in...?
- No. Nor build bonfires, nor beat drums.

352
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,730
I'll meet you on the far side.

353
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,480
Move!

354
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,900
You want some water, Ethan?

355
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,790
Trail leads over there.

356
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,290
Why'd they break off?

357
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,790
Was there water in that canyon?

358
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,920
No water.

359
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,470
Are you all right, Ethan?

360
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,100
I'm all right.

361
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,140
Hey.

362
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,980
What happened to your
Johnny reb coat? Did you lose it?

363
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,480
Must have.

364
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,320
But I'm not going back for it.

365
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,670
I found them!

366
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,800
I found Lucy!

367
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,590
They're camped about a half-mile over.

368
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,510
I was just swinging back
and I seen their smoke.

369
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,350
Bellied up a Ridge, and there they was,
right below me.

370
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:47,860
- Did you see Debbie?
- No. No, but I saw Lucy, all right.

371
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,190
- She was wearing that blue dress...
- what you saw wasn't Lucy.

372
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,950
- Oh, but it... it was, I tell you.
- What you saw was a buck...

373
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,660
...wearing Lucy's dress.

374
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,290
I found Lucy back in the canyon.

375
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,750
Wrapped her in my coat.

376
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,540
Buried her with my own hands.

377
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,840
Thought it best to keep it from you.

378
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,800
Did they...?

379
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,220
- Was she...?
- What do you want me to do?

380
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,560
Draw you a picture?
Spell it out?

381
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,730
Don't ever ask me!

382
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,150
Long as you live,
don't ever ask me more.

383
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,920
Brad. I'm awful sorry, Brad.

384
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:58,340
Hey, Brad...
Brad, wait a minute! Brad!

385
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,760
Wait! Come back here, Brad!

386
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,600
Brad, come back here!

387
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,610
Well, why don't you say it?

388
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,990
We're beat, and you know it.

389
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,610
Nope.

390
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,080
Our turning back don't mean nothing.

391
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,500
Not in the long run.

392
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,330
If she's alive, she's safe.

393
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,830
For a while. They'll keep her...

394
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,170
...they'll raise her
as one of their own until...

395
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,510
Till she's of an age to...

396
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:25,430
Well, do you think maybe there's
a chance we still might find her?

397
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,640
Injun will chase a thing
till he thinks he's chased it enough.

398
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,600
Then he quits.

399
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:35,020
Same way when he runs.

400
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:38,820
Seems like he never learns
there's such a thing as...

401
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,150
...a critter who'll just keep coming on.

402
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,660
So we'll find them in the end,
I promise you.

403
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,990
We'll find them.

404
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,460
Just as sure as the turning
of the earth.

405
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,840
- Hi, Ethan.
- Hello, sir.

406
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,600
- Hi, Marty.
- How are you, sir?

407
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,930
Many

408
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,110
you got my letter
about your son Brad?

409
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,780
Yeah. Just about this time a year ago.

410
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:13,790
Oh, Ethan, this country...

411
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,290
Marty?

412
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:26,090
Martin Pawley!

413
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,970
Him probably forgetting all about you.

414
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,640
Probably can't even
call your name to mind.

415
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,060
Her name's Laurie.

416
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,150
But I fairly forgot
just how pretty she was.

417
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,660
Ethan.

418
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,580
What about Debbie?

419
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,770
Hey, what are you doing anyway?

420
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,980
Hey, don't go taking that stuff!

421
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,940
Well, it ain't worth the mending.

422
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,860
What are you getting so red
in the face about? I got brothers.

423
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,320
Yeah, well, I ain't one of them.

424
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,950
Now, lookie here, Martin Pawley,
I'm a woman.

425
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:32,200
We women wash and mend
your dirty clothes all your lives.

426
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,030
When you're little,
we even wash you.

427
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,700
How you can make out to be bashful
in front of a woman, I'll never know.

428
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,710
You talk like a feller
just might as well run around naked.

429
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,880
Wouldn't bother me none.

430
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,510
Sure wouldn't try it
in front of pa, though, if I was you.

431
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:06,400
We kept tracking them
till the blizzards hit.

432
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,030
Then we lost their trail.

433
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,700
No need to tell you where we went.

434
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,320
Fort Richardson, win gate, Cobb.

435
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,870
Anadarko agency.

436
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,040
Trouble is, we don't know which band
the war party belonged to.

437
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,420
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.

438
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,090
- I got your boy killed.
- Don't go blaming yourself for that.

439
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,340
It's this country killed my boy.

440
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:31,760
- Yes, by golly, I tell you, Ethan...
- now, Lars...

441
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,890
...it just so happens we be Texicans.

442
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:40,770
Texican is nothing but a human man
way out on a limb. This year and next...

443
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:45,230
...and maybe for a hundred more.
But I don't think it'll be forever.

444
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,280
Someday this country's gonna be
a fine, good place to be.

445
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,410
Maybe it needs our bones in the ground
before that time can come.

446
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,410
Bedtime.

447
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,200
She was a schoolteacher, you know.

448
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,750
Ma, Marty's drawers is a sight. Could
we give him some of Brad's things?

449
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,710
Of course.
They're in grandma's chest.

450
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,790
- Ethan, you'll sleep in the bunkhouse.
- By golly, the letter!

451
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,130
In the Sweden chest.

452
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:13,760
It come for you, Ethan. Last winter.
Charlie MacCorry brought it.

453
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,640
I'm looking for that letter
Charlie MacCorry...

454
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:21,470
By Jiminy.

455
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:31,190
Here it is. By golly, I forgot.

456
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:36,990
Excuse me.

457
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:53,130
Mrs. Jorgensen, take a look at this.

458
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,680
- Just a snip of calico.
- Ever see it before?

459
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,140
Maybe on a dress Debbie wore?

460
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:02,930
Why, yes. Yes, it was an apron.

461
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,350
Ethan, have they found her yet?

462
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,480
Not yet.

463
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,530
Not yet.

464
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:19,530
You might at least
have left me my britches!

465
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,030
It's time for bed anyway.

466
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,370
- Here, try these on.
- I ain't gonna.

467
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,170
Well, likely they'll need some taking in.

468
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:31,040
Marty, you're that gaunted. Ma's having
a Turkey for dinner tomorrow...

469
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:35,050
Laurie? Laurie, come.
Let the boys get to bed.

470
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,300
All right, pa.

471
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,890
- Good night, Marty.
- Good night, Laurie.

472
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,810
- Night, Mr. Edwards.
- Night, miss Jorgensen.

473
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:57,820
Jorgensen's been running
my cattle with his own.

474
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,700
Your cattle?

475
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,410
You mean Debbie's cattle.

476
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:08,250
He's agreed to take you on and split
the increase in my herd while I'm gone.

477
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,080
I'm pushing on tomorrow.

478
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,050
Well, I sure ain't gonna stay here.
I started out looking for Debbie...

479
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,010
- ...I intend to keep on.
- Why?

480
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,510
Why?

481
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:21,050
- Well, because she's my...
- she's your nothing.

482
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,050
She's no kin to you at all.

483
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,730
Well, I always
kind of thought she was.

484
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,060
The way her folks took me in,
they raised me...

485
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,940
- that don't make you no kin.
- All right, maybe it don't.

486
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:35,230
- But I intend to keep on looking anyway.
- How?

487
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,610
You got any horses
or money to buy them?

488
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,950
You ain't even got money
for cartridges.

489
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:43,950
Jorgensen's offering you
a good living here.

490
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,870
Martin, there's something
I want you to know...

491
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,920
yeah, I know
what you want me to know.

492
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,880
That I got no kin,
I got no money, no horses!

493
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,760
All I got here is a bunch
of dead man's clothes to wear!

494
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,260
Well, you told me that already,
so shut your mouth!

495
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:18,490
- Morning, Laurie.
- Morning, Martin. Did you sleep well?

496
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,490
Well, no, I...

497
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:25,950
I kind of tossed and turned...

498
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,990
...and dreamed.

499
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:42,880
I'll get your coffee.

500
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,510
You know, Laurie, I...

501
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,310
I was just thinking that...

502
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:52,020
...maybe it's about time you and me
started going steady, huh?

503
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,820
Martin Pawley, you and me been
going steady since we was 3 years old.

504
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,610
- We have?
- About time you found out about it.

505
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,860
Well, gosh, Laurie,
I've always been fond of you...

506
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:07,870
...but, well, with all this trouble
with Debbie and Ethan, I...

507
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,540
Ethan rode on an hour ago.

508
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,500
Martin, I don't know what you can
do about finding Debbie that he can't.

509
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,840
He'll find her now, Martin.
Honest, he will!

510
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,840
That's what I'm afraid of, Laurie.

511
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,130
Him finding her.

512
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:26,180
Oh, I've seen his eyes
at the very word "Comanche."

513
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,060
I've seen him take his knife and...

514
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,390
Never mind.
He's a man that can go crazy wild...

515
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,560
...and I intend to be there
to stop him in case he does.

516
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,730
I was hoping I could hold you here,
but I guess I knew better.

517
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:42,570
Here.

518
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,570
I stole that for you.

519
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,250
"I bought a..."

520
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,090
oh, here, let me read it for you.

521
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,510
"I bought a small-sized dress
off a Injun."

522
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:06,220
If this here's a piece of your
child's dress, bring reward.

523
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,890
I know where they gone.

524
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,260
- "Jerem Futterman."
- Jerem Futterman?

525
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:15,100
Well, Laurie, he's got a small trading
post on the south fork of the Brazos.

526
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,730
I just gotta get a horse!
Do you think your pa...?

527
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,020
- Finish your breakfast!
- But, Laurie, I gotta find him!

528
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:26,530
- All right, go on and find him!
- Oh, Laurie, don't you understand?

529
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:38,790
Laurie, that's your own good horse.
That's sweet face.

530
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,710
You take him, and welcome!

531
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,050
But don't you count on
finding me here when you get back.

532
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,760
I been hanging around
this godforsaken wind scour...

533
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:51,470
...for two long years waiting for you.
I ain't cut out to be no old maid.

534
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:56,230
Well, I'm sorry, Laurie.
But I just gotta catch up with Ethan.

535
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:59,190
Well, go ahead
and catch up with him, then!

536
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:18,160
- Futterman?
- Yeah?

537
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:20,210
Let's talk.

538
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,840
- You sent me a letter.
- Yeah?

539
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,090
About a dress.

540
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,480
How'd you come by it?

541
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,610
- You said there'd be a $1000 reward.
- That's what I said.

542
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,610
Got it with you?

543
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,990
You'll get the reward when
I find her and if she's still alive.

544
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,580
A man's got a right to expect
some kind of payment.

545
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,620
I laid out for that dress
and sending you that writing.

546
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,960
- Twenty Yankee dollars.
- And a man's time is worth something.

547
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,760
Talk.

548
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,550
A young buck fetched it in
late last summer.

549
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,180
Said it belonged to a captive child
of chief scar.

550
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,640
Scar? We ain't never heard of him,
have we?

551
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:21,890
Me neither. But this buck
claimed he was a big war chief...

552
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,270
- ...with the Nawyecky Comanches.
- Keep talking.

553
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,230
Scar's band was headed north to winter
in at fort win gate, eating agency beef.

554
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,700
That's what this buck said.
Maybe he lied.

555
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,410
Maybe you lie.

556
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,950
In that case, my friend,
you won't find her...

557
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,370
...and I won't get my $1000.

558
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,080
Look, you can spend the night.

559
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:45,040
- Cards, a jug. And if you'd like to...
- no, thanks.

560
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,210
Don't forget to come back
with my $1000.

561
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,590
It ain't yours yet.

562
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,180
Hey, Ethan?

563
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,890
Do you have a feeling
that maybe we're being followed?

564
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,430
That's the Injun in you.
Go to sleep.

565
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,270
Them horses there,
they sure act mighty nervous.

566
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,690
Well, they smell
a change in the weather.

567
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:18,030
Oh, now, come on, Ethan!
Don't put any more wood on the fire.

568
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,830
- I'm burning up.
- We might get a frost before morning.

569
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,210
Anyway, I'm getting like
old Mose Harper.

570
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,340
My bones is cold tonight.

571
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:33,380
You know, it's funny...

572
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:36,800
...but last winter,
when we passed through fort win gate...

573
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:41,180
...I don't have any recollection
of a mention of Nawyecky Comanche.

574
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:44,770
Not so funny when you recollect
what "Nawyecky" means.

575
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,860
- What's that?
- Sort of like "roundabout."

576
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:52,610
Man says he's going one place,
means to go to other.

577
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:06,790
Oh, come on, now, Ethan,
don't put any more wood on the fire!

578
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,840
I'm burning up.

579
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:19,300
- Comfortable?
- Ethan, are you all right?

580
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,010
Well, I'm just saying
good night to you.

581
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,770
Well, good night.

582
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:50,750
- Good night.
- Well, good night.

583
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:22,450
Futterman.

584
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:40,090
Thanks. You did fine.

585
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:44,850
Why, that's Mr. Futterman.

586
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:46,970
Ethan, what are you doing anyway?

587
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:51,100
Getting my money back, you idiot.
What do you suppose?

588
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,900
We did all right.

589
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,320
"We"? Why, you just staked me
out there like a piece of bait!

590
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:06,200
You went and built up the fire, you fixed
it so I could get my brains blowed out!

591
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:08,750
What if you had missed?

592
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,370
Never occurred to me.

593
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:16,840
Come on, let's get out of here.

594
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:27,640
Howdy, Mr. Jorgensen.

595
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:31,230
- Charlie!
- Got me a letter here.

596
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:34,400
By golly, a letter?

597
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,190
It's for miss Laurie.

598
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,900
Two letters in one year, by golly!

599
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:43,160
Mama! Mama! It's Charlie MacCorry.

600
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,290
He's come with a letter and
he's come a-courting too, by golly!

601
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,540
Come on.

602
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,500
- Good morning, Charlie.
- Howdy, Mrs. Jorgensen.

603
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:56,500
Laurie, here's a letter for you.
Charlie brought it.

604
00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:00,460
I figured it might be the news
you been waiting for, so I...

605
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,630
- well, thank you, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

606
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,970
- Say, I brung you some boiled sweets.
- Why, thank you, Charlie.

607
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,680
Come on, let's sit down and get
comfortable while Laurie reads the letter.

608
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:11,680
I reckon I really ought to be going...

609
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:15,400
- no, sit down, Charlie.
- No, no, you stay, Charlie. After all...

610
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,940
...Charlie brought the letter, Laurie.
He's got a right to listen too.

611
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:23,070
- I'll sit a spell.
- Come on, Laurie, read the letter.

612
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,240
- Oh, ma, it's my letter.
- Of course it is, dear. But read it.

613
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:30,120
Go ahead. Read it.

614
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,550
Please.

615
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,880
"Dear miss Laury..."

616
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:45,050
spelled it with a y
instead of an I-E.

617
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,720
- You'd think he'd know better.
- Oh, spelling, please.

618
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:50,640
What's the difference?
Read the letter.

619
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:56,940
"Dear miss Laury,
I take pencil in hand to let you know...

620
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:01,070
...Ethan and me still are trying
to catch up with them Comanches...

621
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:04,700
...the late Mr. Futterman
told us about."

622
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,610
The late Mr. Futterman.

623
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,530
That means Mr. Futterman is dead,
by golly.

624
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:13,330
- Oh, the poor man. Go ahead, Laurie.
- Yeah.

625
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:20,460
"We out north through Indian
territory and did not have no trouble..."

626
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:23,710
...finding Kiowas and Wichitas...

627
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,300
...and even some Comanches...

628
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:29,010
...camped by one of the agencies.

629
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,140
But none of them was Nawyecky...

630
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:36,980
"...nor claimed to know
a war chief called scar."

631
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,850
Scar.

632
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:47,110
"He's the one the late
Mr. Futterman said had Debbie."

633
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:51,280
At one of the agencies, we outfitted...

634
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:54,620
<i>...with all kind and manner
of trade goods...</i>

635
01:01:54,790 --> 01:02:00,670
<i>...figuring that'd make it easier
for us to come and go.</i>

636
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:08,970
<i>"You'd laugh if I told you
what was our biggest seller."</i>

637
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:00,730
Let's go. I think I stumbled
onto something.

638
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,230
Scar? You found him?

639
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,900
When are you gonna learn
to keep your big mouth shut?

640
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:06,900
Get your horse. Let's get out of here.

641
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:10,320
- I just bought me a good blanket...
- forget it. Move!

642
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,000
What I heard back there was
that a band of hostile Comanche...

643
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,330
...came through less than a week ago.

644
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,500
I asked if there was
a white girl with them.

645
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,670
They got sullen and suspicious.

646
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,510
- Do you...? Think it might have been...?
- I don't know.

647
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:38,350
What's she following us for?

648
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:43,270
Oh, you... you go on back now. Go on.

649
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:46,770
Oh, look, I changed my mind.
You can keep your blanket.

650
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:54,410
Oh, look, you don't understand.
I don't want it!

651
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:57,540
You don't understand, you chunk head.

652
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,830
You didn't buy any blanket.

653
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,370
You bought her.

654
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,620
You got yourself a wife, Sonny.

655
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:07,380
Oh, no. Ethan, you tell her
to get on back there.

656
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:10,760
What? And have her whole family
after our scalps...

657
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,680
...for flaunting one of
their womenfolk? No, sir.

658
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,100
Come on, Mrs. Pawley.

659
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:20,930
Come on, Mrs. Pawley.
Join our merry crew.

660
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,690
"Mrs. Pawley"?

661
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:26,690
Oh, no.

662
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:30,940
"There is one other thing
I got to tell you..."

663
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:34,410
...before you hear it from Ethan.

664
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,780
How I got myself...

665
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,450
"...a wife."

666
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,580
- He did?
- Good!

667
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:48,590
A young man should get married
early in life. Right, mama?

668
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:56,140
- Go ahead and read the letter, Laurie.
- Yeah.

669
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:03,230
"A little Comanche squaw..."

670
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,900
squaw!

671
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:10,730
- Laurie, you ought to be spanked!
- Laurie, you come back...

672
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,570
- ...and read the letter. Come on, now.
- This is a shame.

673
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,070
Come on back and read it. Please.

674
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,950
Mama, here. You read the letter.

675
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:26,460
Charlie, my wife, she was
a schoolteacher. She reads good.

676
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,250
I'll read it.

677
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:33,210
So he married a Comanche squaw.

678
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,220
By golly.

679
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:47,390
"She wasn't near as old as you."

680
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:51,070
How old does he think I am?!

681
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:56,610
Hey, look, coffee. Me, coffee.

682
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:06,250
Could I have a little, Mrs. Pawley?

683
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,330
Yes, sir.

684
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:13,250
Looks like Mrs. Pawley's
gonna make you a fine, dutiful wife.

685
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,260
Oh, cut it out, will you?

686
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:24,520
Oh, look. I sure do wish
I could make you understand.

687
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:27,850
Look?

688
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,360
Look.

689
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:38,740
She says her name is
wild goose flying in the night sky.

690
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:43,120
But she'll answer to "look"
if that pleases you.

691
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:19,570
You know, that's grounds
for divorce in Texas.

692
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,950
You're really rough!

693
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,660
Well, I don't think
it's so dad burn funny.

694
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:31,080
Look, if you really wanna do some good,
why don't you ask her where soar is?

695
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:38,340
She heard you.

696
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:49,100
- You ask her.
- Look, scar?

697
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,980
Do you know where he went?

698
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:54,150
Did he have a girl with him?
A white girl?

699
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:02,650
No. No, not a woman. It's...

700
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,080
sister.

701
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,760
Martin!

702
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,980
Look's gone.

703
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,610
Pulled out in the night.

704
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:42,360
Well, she ain't going back to her family,
that's for certain.

705
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:45,450
She took off the way
that arrow's pointing.

706
01:08:45,610 --> 01:08:48,240
Well, think maybe
we ought to follow her?

707
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:50,290
How should I know?

708
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:52,750
She's your wife.

709
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,710
<i>Maybe she left other signs
for us to follow...</i>

710
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,710
"... But we'll never know...

711
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:04,220
...because it snowed that day
and all the next week."

712
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:09,760
<i>We were heading north
through buffalo country...</i>

713
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:13,680
<i>...when something happened that
I ain't got straight in my own mind yet.</i>

714
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:16,520
<i>But on this day
we sighted a small herd.</i>

715
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,020
<i>See, we needed some meat...</i>

716
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:21,690
<i>...so we circled round
and come up on them afoot.</i>

717
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,900
- Ethan, don't make no sense.
- Hunger! Empty bellies!

718
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:03,650
That's the sense it makes,
you blanket head!

719
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:05,900
You need to stop it!

720
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:16,830
At least they won't feed
any Comanche this winter.

721
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:21,710
- Ethan, listen! Listen!
- Killing buffaloes is like killing lnjuns.

722
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,750
- You just gotta...
- listen!

723
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:38,190
Come on!

724
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:31,240
<i>It was the Nawyecky Comanche,
all right.</i>

725
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:34,530
<i>The ones we'd been looking for
all this time.</i>

726
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,050
Many

727
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,860
it's look.

728
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,990
Look?

729
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:17,120
What did them soldiers have to kill
her for? She never done nobody harm.

730
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,910
We gotta catch up with them.
Maybe they've got Debbie.

731
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,870
Maybe they got that chief
they call scar.

732
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,710
<i>So we figured Debbie had been
in the village.</i>

733
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,710
<i>What look was doing there,
whether she'd come to warn him...</i>

734
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:34,220
<i>...or maybe to find Debbie for me,
there's no way of knowing.</i>

735
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:22,520
- Come on, move along, move along.
- Go on there. Go on up there.

736
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:25,560
Come on, move along there.
Hurry up, move along now.

737
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:41,540
Come on, hurry up, get along.
Go on, get up. Hurry up.

738
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,660
- Evening.
- Yes?

739
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:47,210
We're looking for a girl.
White girl, captive.

740
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:49,380
Should be about 14 now.

741
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:51,380
Fourteen? We've got two
about that age.

742
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:52,880
- Where?
- Sergeant?

743
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:54,840
All the white women
are in the chapel.

744
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,340
What's this girl to you?

745
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,470
- She's my niece.
- She's my...

746
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,640
one moment.

747
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,270
- White women?
- Yes, sir.

748
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,460
Could you stand up?

749
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,300
Stand up, please.

750
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,680
Debbie?

751
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:01,910
It's hard to believe they're white.

752
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:04,490
They ain't white...

753
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,040
...anymore.

754
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,040
They're Comanche.

755
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:11,000
Where are your casualties?

756
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:33,190
Maybe you can help us identify them.
All white. All captives.

757
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,730
There's the white girl there.

758
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:47,410
No.

759
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:56,800
"So we're setting out for new Mexico
territory in the morning."

760
01:15:57,050 --> 01:16:00,340
I am sorry I won't be back...

761
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:03,720
...for Christmas again this year.

762
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:09,980
I set pencil aside in the hope
you are enjoying good health...

763
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:12,690
...and your folks the same.

764
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:15,860
I remain, respectfully...

765
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:19,730
"...yours truly, Martin Pawley."

766
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,280
They never find that girl.

767
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:27,030
Nope, never.

768
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,670
"Yours truly."

769
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,840
Ma, he had to sign his whole name,
"Martin Pawley."

770
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,800
He couldn't write just "Marty."

771
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,680
- I don't care if he never comes back!
- Laurie, Laurie!

772
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:54,440
Charlie, you stay for supper.
I won't take no for an answer.

773
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:59,440
The thought of saying no never
entered my head, Mrs. Jorgensen.

774
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,940
Ain't no place I'd rather be
than right here...

775
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:05,610
...right now.

776
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:51,660
- Recognize it?
- That?

777
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:55,620
Couldn't be two like that
in the whole world. Mose!

778
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,540
Mose Harper!

779
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,880
- Hey, Mose!
- Sure is good to see you!

780
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:06,260
Mose, you look mangier than ever.

781
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,050
- How about a drink?
- Yes, sir. Thank you kindly.

782
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:11,390
- Tequila.
- Ain't been too good.

783
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:13,720
No, sir. Not too good.

784
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:16,690
- Getting old.
- You were born old.

785
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:20,060
Been helping you, Ethan.
Been looking all the time.

786
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:23,270
Well, reward still stands.

787
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:28,490
Don't want no money, Ethan.
No money, Marty.

788
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:33,240
Just a roof over old Mose's head...

789
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:35,950
...and a rocking chair by the fire.

790
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,790
My own rocking chair
by the fire, Marty.

791
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,000
You help us find that girl,
you got your rocking chair.

792
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:45,300
Swear it, Ethan? Given word?

793
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,970
I told you, didn't I?

794
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:51,680
Ethan, I found a man who's seen her.

795
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:54,140
Knows where little Debbie is.

796
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:56,730
Where is he? Who is this man?

797
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:59,600
- Promise?
- Who is this man?

798
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:02,360
I am this man, señor.

799
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:06,070
Emilio Gabriel Fernandez y Figueroa.

800
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:08,950
At your service. For a price.

801
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:11,360
Always for a price.

802
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,460
- Say, I think I'd like just...
- wait till you grow up.

803
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:56,700
Let's talk a little business.

804
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,950
Why not.

805
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:16,180
<i>Mamacita, mas frijoles, please.</i>

806
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:33,150
Let's go.

807
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:36,160
- But I'm hungry.
- Well, while you're filling your belly...

808
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,200
...I'm going out to meet
a Comanche named Cicatriz.

809
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:41,410
Never heard of him.

810
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:45,710
Cicatriz is Mexican for "scar."

811
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,250
Medicine country, huh?

812
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,880
Bad medicine, I think.

813
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:40,490
- This is the great Cicatriz, war chief...
- scar, huh?

814
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:47,660
Plain to see how you got your name.

815
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:51,130
You, big shoulders.

816
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:55,510
Young one, he who follows.

817
01:22:55,710 --> 01:23:00,340
You speak pretty good American
for a Comanche.

818
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:02,720
Someone teach you?

819
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:14,650
Right. We come to trade.
Only, not out here.

820
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:17,820
I don't stand talking in the wind.

821
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:47,020
You speak good Comanche.
Someone teach you?

822
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:51,350
- You stay out of here.
- Not likely.

823
01:23:56,900 --> 01:24:01,740
His sons are dead, so his wives
sit on the honor side of his lodge.

824
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:09,830
Are all those his wives?

825
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,920
Two sons killed by white men.

826
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:18,130
For each son, I take many...

827
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:20,300
Scalps.

828
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,210
We've seen scalps before.

829
01:24:58,210 --> 01:25:00,590
This before?

830
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,430
I came to trade,
not to admire his collection.

831
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,600
Tell him we'll pitch camp
the other side of the creek.

832
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:16,270
- Talk tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

833
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:35,080
- It is not that I am afraid.
- Don't apologize. You got well-paid.

834
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:40,840
But he knows who you are. And why
you're here. This I did not know.

835
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,380
Take it. I do not want blood money.

836
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:07,570
You think old scar means to kill us?

837
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:09,620
He's got to.

838
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:12,910
We've been asking for it for five years.

839
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:17,290
Well, why didn't he make his move
back there?

840
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:22,840
Hospitality, I guess.
Comanche hospitality.

841
01:26:25,170 --> 01:26:28,260
Why? Do you wanna pull out too'?

842
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:34,930
"Big shoulders."

843
01:26:46,570 --> 01:26:48,240
Debbie?

844
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:55,080
Debbie. Debbie, don't you remember?
I'm Martin. I'm Martin, your brother.

845
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:57,790
Remember?

846
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,380
Debbie, remember back.

847
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:06,010
Do you remember how I used
to let you ride my horse?

848
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:08,970
And tell you stories?

849
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:12,220
Don't you remember me, Debbie?

850
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,720
I remember.

851
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:17,310
From always.

852
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:20,310
At first, I prayed to you:

853
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:22,770
"Come and get me...

854
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,270
...take me home."

855
01:27:24,730 --> 01:27:26,690
You didn't come.

856
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,950
But I've come now, Debbie.

857
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:32,660
These are my people.

858
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:37,500
Go. Go, Martin. Please.

859
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,120
Stand aside, Martin.

860
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:46,500
No, you don't, Ethan.

861
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:49,340
Ethan! No, you don't!

862
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:53,010
Stand aside!

863
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:14,620
Debbie. Debbie.

864
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:19,070
Well...

865
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:23,490
...looks as though I'm gonna
have to open that shoulder again...

866
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:26,160
...get the poison out.

867
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,960
Beats me how you could have
stayed alive this long.

868
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,460
I want you to...

869
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:32,670
To read this.

870
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,060
I

871
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:50,100
...Ethan Edwards...

872
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:54,900
...being of a sound mind...

873
01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:56,690
...and...

874
01:30:56,860 --> 01:31:01,620
...without any blood kin...

875
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:10,170
"...do hereby..."

876
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:14,550
"Bequeath." Means "leave."

877
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:17,550
"Bequeath..."

878
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:22,340
...all my property...

879
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:25,010
...of any kind...

880
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:27,270
...to...

881
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:30,190
"...Martin Pawley."

882
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:35,860
What do you mean,
you don't have any blood kin?

883
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:39,650
- Why, Debbie's your blood kin!
- Not no more, she ain't.

884
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:42,410
Well, you can keep your will!

885
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:44,370
I don't want any of your property!

886
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:48,290
I ain't forgetting you was getting
all set to shoot her yourself.

887
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,460
- What kind of a man are you?
- She's been living with a buck!

888
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:54,130
- She's nothing but a...
- shut your dirty mouth!

889
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,340
I hope you die.

890
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:05,470
That'll be the day.

891
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:15,900
One, two, three, four!

892
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:07,280
Evening, everybody!
Evening, sister. We made it!

893
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:08,950
- Hello!
- Hello. Where's Charlie?

894
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:13,460
Well, sister, here he is! All curried and
combed and washed behind the ears.

895
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:16,540
Charlie, you look right handsome!
I'd hardly know you.

896
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:20,300
Yes, ma'am. I can't hardly
recognize myself.

897
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,840
Let it on, Luther!

898
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,930
- Hiya, partner.
- Well, howdy, Charlie.

899
01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:28,300
How's your guitar?

900
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:41,610
- Won't you have a drink, reverend?
- No, Nesby...

901
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:45,610
...not till I'm finished my clergying.
Bar's closed. Right, sister Jorgensen?

902
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:48,740
- Right.
- All right, let's go! Let's get her going!

903
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:50,870
Charlie!

904
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:02,380
Go ahead, Lars.

905
01:34:04,670 --> 01:34:06,340
Bible.

906
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:12,470
- Get them spurs off.
- Yes, sir.

907
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,850
All right, line up to the side, boys.

908
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:30,240
Music.

909
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:12,160
You don't suppose they're
throwing a party for us, do you?

910
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,620
That'll be the day.

911
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:22,330
I'm all right.

912
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:30,220
Ethan, Marty!
No, no, you can't come in!

913
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:33,100
- The rangers is in there.
- What's that got to do with us?

914
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:35,350
You been posted for murder,
the both of you!

915
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:38,100
That trader fella,
the late Mr. Futterman.

916
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:41,060
The reverend and the rangers
are in there now, waiting.

917
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:43,980
- Well, what's going on anyway?
- Well, the...

918
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:55,200
looks like you two will have
a lot to talk about. Come on.

919
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:59,080
- But, Ethan, hide in the barn...
- what for?

920
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:01,250
Martin.

921
01:36:04,290 --> 01:36:07,420
Please! Look, everybody!

922
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:12,260
Look, mama. Look who's here.

923
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,640
Evening.

924
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:19,770
- Bar open?
- Ethan...

925
01:36:19,930 --> 01:36:22,350
...any news of our little girl?

926
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,810
She's not a little girl anymore.

927
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:30,280
- You've seen her? She's alive?
- I've seen her. She's alive.

928
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:32,990
Evening, reverend.

929
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,320
Or should I call you "captain"?

930
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:37,490
I came here for a wedding, Ethan.

931
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:40,040
Till that's over, I reckon
"reverend" will do.

932
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,290
- Afterwards, we'll talk.
- Marty with you?

933
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:45,250
Yep.

934
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:47,920
- Charlie, please.
- Charlie!

935
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:49,420
Mama! Mama, no!

936
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:52,590
Good to see you back, Ethan.
We'll join you.

937
01:36:53,970 --> 01:36:56,430
But I wrote you one letter.

938
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:59,640
One letter in five years.

939
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:04,270
I read it till the paper dried up
and the writing faded out.

940
01:37:04,770 --> 01:37:08,190
Yeah, guess it wasn't
much of a letter, was it?

941
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,610
No, it wasn't.

942
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,900
You might've at least
said you loved me.

943
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:18,240
You might've asked me to wait for you.
At least that would've been something.

944
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,500
But I always loved you.

945
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:26,420
I thought you knew that
without me having to say it.

946
01:37:27,210 --> 01:37:29,960
It isn't fair, Martin Pawley.

947
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:32,300
It isn't fair, and you know it!

948
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:36,470
- I wish you wouldn't cry, Laurie.
- Who's crying?

949
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:48,900
Well, I just reckon the best thing
for me to do is go away.

950
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:54,190
You do, Martin Pawley,
and I'll just die!

951
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:10,040
I'll thank you to unhand my fiancée.

952
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,590
You don't mean you're
gonna be marrying him?

953
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:20,180
- Charlie MacCorry?
- She sure is!

954
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:24,180
And don't think your coming back
is gonna change it either.

955
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:26,980
Well, now, as to that,
I just don't know, Charlie.

956
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:29,520
We hadn't gotten around
to talking about marriage.

957
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:33,070
What right have you got to be talking
marriage to any decent woman?

958
01:38:33,230 --> 01:38:35,240
If you're referring to
that murder charge...

959
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,650
and other things.

960
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:40,620
Maybe you think you was
getting away with being smart...

961
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:44,080
...about that Indian wife you took.

962
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:48,120
I'll bet she ain't
the first squaw you ever...

963
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:51,880
why, you ornery, no-good son of a...

964
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:55,460
oh, Marty, you've done it again!

965
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,090
Get out of my way!

966
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:02,970
Marty, Charlie! I ain't gonna
have fighting in my house.

967
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:05,970
Well, then we're just gonna
fight outside, doggone it.

968
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:07,730
I ain't toting no firearms.

969
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:09,900
Well, that sure ain't
gonna be no problem.

970
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:12,190
Ma! Pa! Reverend Clayton!

971
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:15,480
- After you, Marty.
- After you, Charlie.

972
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:19,660
Pa! Reverend Clayton! Pa!

973
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:23,740
Well, here.

974
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:28,660
Thank you.

975
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:39,590
Spit over that piece of firewood.

976
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:59,990
Quit that, Marty! That ain't fair!

977
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:07,660
Martin! Martin! Charlie!

978
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:11,960
- Marty, now you stop that. Marty!
- Marty! Charlie!

979
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:14,210
Marty! "Stop it!"

980
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:19,800
- Sergeant MacCorry! Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?

981
01:40:19,970 --> 01:40:22,590
Is this here altercation
in the line of duty?

982
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:26,220
No, sir. It's more in the nature
of a private fight.

983
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:31,480
Well, all right, then. Go ahead.
But fight fair. No biting or gouging.

984
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:34,020
And no kicking either!

985
01:40:35,150 --> 01:40:37,520
Get them up, get them up.
Make them fight fair.

986
01:40:37,690 --> 01:40:39,360
All right. You fight fair, Martin!

987
01:40:39,530 --> 01:40:41,190
Hey, wait a minute, Marty.

988
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:45,870
- Somebody's fiddle.
- Hey, Seth.

989
01:40:46,530 --> 01:40:49,620
- No choking. No gouging.
- Come on, Charlie. Give it to him.

990
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,830
Pa! Mr. Edwards, make them stop!

991
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:58,380
- Why? You started it.
- Marty, watch his feet!

992
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:03,260
- Oh, Ethan, no!
- Don't forget you're a lady.

993
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:05,340
- Come on!
- Fight fair now.

994
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:07,390
Fight fair!

995
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,600
- Don't let Charlie...
- come on, Charlie!

996
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:13,890
- That's it, Charlie.
- Thattaboy, Charlie!

997
01:41:17,610 --> 01:41:21,150
Charlie, Charlie!
Come on, Charlie, get up here.

998
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:23,610
- Charlie, you all right?
- Marty, Marty, come on.

999
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:25,950
I reckon so.

1000
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:29,950
Now, come on. I want you boys
to shake hands and make friends.

1001
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:34,410
Sorry I bit your ear, Marty.

1002
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:38,000
Oh, it... it don't hurt none, Charlie.

1003
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:42,170
Now, you boys get cleaned up
and we'll proceed with the wedding.

1004
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:46,300
- Oh, where's my Bible?
- There ain't gonna be no wedding.

1005
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:57,810
Not till we get a few things
cleared up around here.

1006
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:04,900
Well, sister Jorgensen,
it was a nice wedding party...

1007
01:42:05,070 --> 01:42:07,950
...considering nobody got married.

1008
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:15,830
Ethan, I gotta ask you and Martin to take
a ride with me down to the state capital.

1009
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:19,630
Is this an invite
to a necktie party, reverend?

1010
01:42:19,790 --> 01:42:22,380
No, I wouldn't say that.

1011
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:26,260
Likely you had your reasons
for killing Futterman.

1012
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:28,550
Probably needed killing.

1013
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:33,220
I'm talking to you now as a ranger,
not as a preacher.

1014
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:36,180
The fact that all three of them
was shot in the back...

1015
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:39,480
...was the only thing that
raised some question.

1016
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:41,570
That“

1017
01:42:41,730 --> 01:42:45,610
...and a missing gold piece that was
known to have been on him...

1018
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:49,160
...just prior to his demise.

1019
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:54,240
Ethan, I have to ask you for your gun.

1020
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:09,220
Well, if it's all the same
to you, reverend...

1021
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:12,680
- ...I ain't going to Austin.
- You're going if the captain says so.

1022
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:14,970
- Boys! Charlie!
- Stop it! Stop it!

1023
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:17,560
I'll put both of you in
the smokehouse to cool off!

1024
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:20,440
- Marty, sit down!
- Sergeant!

1025
01:43:21,650 --> 01:43:24,690
Good evening, ma'am.
Captain Clayton.

1026
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:26,860
Excuse me, ma'am.

1027
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:31,410
- Captain Clayton, sir.
- No.

1028
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:33,530
I'm captain Clayton.

1029
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:36,200
- You're captain Clayton?
- Yes, I'm captain Clayton.

1030
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,580
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir.

1031
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,750
- The colonel wants to...
- Is your head cold?

1032
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,670
No, sir.

1033
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,790
I'm sorry, sir.
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

1034
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,630
All right, start at the beginning.

1035
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,420
Colonel Greenhill's compliments.
The colonel wishes...

1036
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:51,970
hold on. Who is this colonel
you're talking about?

1037
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:54,640
Colonel green hill is colonel green hill.
Commanding...

1038
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,680
- and who are you?
- I'm lieutenant green hill, sir.

1039
01:43:57,850 --> 01:44:00,190
What is it your pa wants to know?

1040
01:44:00,810 --> 01:44:02,690
Well, go ahead.

1041
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:05,570
My pa wants to know...
colonel green hill wants to know...

1042
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:08,820
- ...how soon you can put a company...
- turn around, Sonny.

1043
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,320
Yeah, he's a Yankee cavalryman.

1044
01:44:12,490 --> 01:44:14,990
Colonel green hill wants to know
how soon you could...

1045
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:19,040
- I resent that, sir.
- Just funning, son, just funning.

1046
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,750
He wants to know how soon
you can put men in the field...

1047
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,170
...for joint punitive action
against the Comanche.

1048
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:26,800
- Joint what?
- Joint punitive action.

1049
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,880
We received information about a band
of Comanches under a chief named scar.

1050
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:33,430
- What information?
- That he's not far from here...

1051
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:36,430
- ...holed up somewhere.
- What makes you think he's not far?

1052
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,520
Yesterday, a patrol
picked up a man...

1053
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:41,020
...claims he was scar's prisoner
two days ago.

1054
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:43,350
Talks kind of crazy,
but we brought him along.

1055
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,020
Says he lives here.
Keeps mentioning a rocking chair.

1056
01:44:46,190 --> 01:44:48,360
Mose. Mose!

1057
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:51,780
Mose!

1058
01:44:52,570 --> 01:44:54,860
Take his arms, Sam.

1059
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:58,950
- Old Mose.
- It's Mose!

1060
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:02,580
Evening, ma'am.
Come for my rocking chair.

1061
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:04,040
Bring him to the fire.

1062
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:06,330
- Watch him!
- Grab him!

1063
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:08,960
Get him up.

1064
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:12,130
- Here, get him a chair.
- Charlie.

1065
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:14,470
Bring him a drink.

1066
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:17,430
- Watch his head.
- Here you are, Mose.

1067
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,260
- Take a big swallow.
- Take a drink.

1068
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:21,980
- Drink that down. Make you feel better.
- That's it.

1069
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:28,230
Mose. Scar, where is he?

1070
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:31,900
My rocking chair.
You promised me my rocking chair.

1071
01:45:32,070 --> 01:45:33,860
- Where is scar?
- Ask him about Debbie.

1072
01:45:34,030 --> 01:45:36,360
Is Debbie all right, Mose?

1073
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:40,950
Made out I was crazy.

1074
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:45,790
You don't think I'm crazy,
do you, ma'am?

1075
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:49,500
- No, Mose, you're just sick and hurt.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1076
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:53,050
Mose, try and remember.
You were at scar's camp.

1077
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:56,220
Ate dirt, chewed grass.
I fooled them...

1078
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:58,720
where's scar holed up?

1079
01:45:58,890 --> 01:46:01,010
Won't tell you.

1080
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:03,930
Tell Marty.

1081
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:06,560
Seven fingers, Marty.

1082
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:09,270
- Seven fingers.
- That's enough. Let's get him to bed.

1083
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:11,320
Wait a minute. Seven fingers?

1084
01:46:12,070 --> 01:46:14,190
Beg to report, sir.
That's what he told us...

1085
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:16,280
...but there's no such place
on the maps.

1086
01:46:16,490 --> 01:46:18,280
Say...

1087
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:22,540
Say, isn't it the Caddo name for where
all them canyons join under the Malapai?

1088
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:25,410
- Seven fingers. Seven fingers of Brazos!
- Caddo or Kiowa.

1089
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:28,580
- Boy!
- Come on. Let's get him up to his room.

1090
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:30,750
My rocking chair.
I want my rocking chair.

1091
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:33,210
- We'll bring it.
- We'll bring it.

1092
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:35,800
You go tell your pa that
a company of rangers...

1093
01:46:35,970 --> 01:46:39,930
...all 14 of them, fully armed and
equipped, will be in the field by daylight.

1094
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:42,470
We'll be heading for the south end
of the Malapai.

1095
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:44,850
If he can catch up with us,
all well and good.

1096
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:49,060
But, captain, we can't possibly take the
field tomorrow. For your own protection.

1097
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:53,610
Our protect...?! Sonny, out yonder is
a passel of murderers...

1098
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:56,900
...complete with Texican scalps
and a white-girl captive.

1099
01:46:57,070 --> 01:46:59,910
You wanna protect us,
just keep out of our way.

1100
01:47:00,070 --> 01:47:02,240
Now you skedaddle back to your pa!

1101
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:07,040
Ethan, you and Martin are hereby
appointed civilian scouts. Without pay.

1102
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:11,670
Charlie, take the boys and get back to
headquarters and pick up the company.

1103
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:16,010
Martin?

1104
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,180
You're not going. Not this time.

1105
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:27,430
- You crazy?
- It's too late.

1106
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,440
She's a woman grown now.

1107
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:32,270
But I gotta go, Laurie.
I gotta fetch her home.

1108
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,070
Fetch what home?

1109
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:37,150
The leavings of Comanche bucks,
sold to the highest bidder...

1110
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:39,400
- ...with savage brats of her own?
- Shut your mouth!

1111
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:41,990
Do you know what Ethan will do
if he has a chance?

1112
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:44,780
He'll put a bullet in her brain.

1113
01:47:44,990 --> 01:47:47,450
I tell you, Martha would want him to.

1114
01:47:47,620 --> 01:47:49,960
Only if I'm dead.

1115
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,920
We can get within
a couple of hundred yards of them.

1116
01:48:41,090 --> 01:48:44,090
There's a hub back off the left.

1117
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,810
How many you figure?

1118
01:48:46,970 --> 01:48:49,310
About a dozen each.

1119
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:51,980
Enough to go around.

1120
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:58,780
I'll see you later.

1121
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:03,400
Well, we found them.

1122
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:04,950
Now, men...

1123
01:49:05,110 --> 01:49:10,500
...the state of Texas is paying you
12 Yankee dollars a month.

1124
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:12,710
Now's your chance to earn it.

1125
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,710
Tighten up your cinches.
We go charging in about sunup.

1126
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,380
- Now, make sure that...
- just a minute, reverend!

1127
01:49:25,930 --> 01:49:28,600
We go charging in, they'll kill her,
and you know it!

1128
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:31,600
- That's what I'm counting on.
- I know you are!

1129
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:34,810
It ain't gonna be that way.
She's alive. She's gonna stay alive.

1130
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:39,650
- Living with Comanches ain't being alive.
- Better that than her brains bashed out!

1131
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:44,200
Now, son, I know this is a bitter thing
to say, but there's more at stake here...

1132
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:46,910
- ...than your sister.
- There sure is.

1133
01:49:47,070 --> 01:49:48,830
I'm gonna tell you something.

1134
01:49:48,990 --> 01:49:52,410
Didn't mean to speak of it,
but I'm gonna tell you now.

1135
01:49:52,580 --> 01:49:56,040
You remember that scalp strung
on scar's Lance?

1136
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:57,420
- Long and wavy?
- I saw it.

1137
01:49:57,580 --> 01:49:59,840
Don't try to tell me
it was Martha's or Lucy's!

1138
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,130
It was your mother's.

1139
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:08,510
- Come on, son.
- But that don't change it.

1140
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,970
That don't change nothing!

1141
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:16,480
Give me a chance to sneak in and get
her before you come charging in.

1142
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:19,270
- What if you get caught?
- That don't tell them nothing.

1143
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,440
- Just one man alone.
- I say no.

1144
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:24,240
You go right ahead, son.

1145
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,780
But at the first sign of an alarm,
we're coming in.

1146
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:32,540
And we ain't gonna have no time to pick
and choose our targets when we do.

1147
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,960
It's your funeral.

1148
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:45,530
Captain Clayton! Captain!

1149
01:51:45,860 --> 01:51:49,780
- Captain Clayton!
- What the Sam hill?

1150
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:55,950
- Captain Clayton, sir.
- Damn... go ahead!

1151
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:59,290
Why don't you have your bugler
blow the charge while you're at it?

1152
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,500
- Sir?
- Oh, never mind.

1153
01:52:01,670 --> 01:52:06,420
- Does your pa know you're out here?
- Yes, sir. Troop's about 10 miles back.

1154
01:52:06,590 --> 01:52:09,840
- The colonel sent me out looking for you.
- You found me. Good work.

1155
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:13,050
- Good work. Goodbye.
- If there's anything I can do, sir...

1156
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:17,350
God forbid. You just flog on back
and tell you pa where we're at.

1157
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:20,810
- And where he's at.
- But he knows that, sir.

1158
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:24,690
Can't I stay? Please?

1159
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:27,900
Oh, all right. But you watch me, boy.

1160
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:32,110
I'm the hard case you're up against
out here, not them childish savages.

1161
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:36,120
And if you don't hear my first holler,
you better read my mind...

1162
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:40,000
...because I don't aim to raise no
two hollers on any subject at hand!

1163
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:42,500
- Yes, sir.
- Boy!

1164
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:46,500
- Watch that knife!
- Sorry, sir.

1165
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:07,520
Halt!

1166
01:53:09,110 --> 01:53:10,740
Mount!

1167
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:18,530
Mount. Mount! M-o-n-t-e, mount!

1168
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:46,100
Debbie.

1169
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,270
Debbie.

1170
01:53:50,270 --> 01:53:54,150
Debbie. Don't say anything, Debbie!
It's your brother Marty, Debbie.

1171
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:57,320
I'm gonna take you away.
I'm gonna get you out of here, Debbie.

1172
01:53:57,490 --> 01:54:01,200
Yes, Marty. Oh, yes, Marty.

1173
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:11,670
Brethren, leave us go amongst them!

1174
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:13,880
Bugler!

1175
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:35,610
Get in there!

1176
01:54:51,210 --> 01:54:54,050
Charlie, Nesby, run off that pony herd...

1177
01:54:54,210 --> 01:54:56,420
- boy, you watch out for that knife!
- Yes, sir.

1178
01:54:56,590 --> 01:54:58,430
Let's go!

1179
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:34,460
Oh, no, Ethan! No, Ethan!

1180
01:55:35,380 --> 01:55:37,380
No, Ethan!

1181
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:53,900
Debbie!

1182
01:55:59,070 --> 01:56:01,570
No, Ethan! No!

1183
01:56:13,330 --> 01:56:15,710
Let's go home, Debbie.

1184
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:27,350
- Does that hurt, reverend?
- Shut up!

1185
01:56:33,190 --> 01:56:34,940
Come on.

1186
01:56:41,570 --> 01:56:44,490
Good work, captain. Good work, son.

1187
01:56:44,660 --> 01:56:46,530
You wounded?

1188
01:56:46,910 --> 01:56:50,620
- Bullet? An arrow?
- No.
