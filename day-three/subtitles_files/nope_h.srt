1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,720
<i>And of course</i>
<i>I set it to Icelandic time</i>

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,640
<i>because we share</i>
<i>a love of the aurora borealis, Gordy.</i>

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,320
<i>And you have no idea</i>
<i>how to tell time.</i>

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,560
<i>Great gift, Dad.</i>

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,200
<i>Way to think things through.</i>

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,440
<i>Somehow, you'd think that a man</i>
<i>who can send a rocket into space</i>

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,400
<i>would be able to manage</i>
<i>a halfway decent birthday present.</i>

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,720
<i>Nope.</i>

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,920
<i>You know, Gordy</i>

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,280
<i>all things considered</i>

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,680
<i>maybe my gift isn't so bad after all.</i>

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,800
<i>Hey, Gordy. Surprise!</i>

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>Wow! Now, there's a gift.</i>

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,640
<i>Here you go, Gordy. Happy birthday.</i>

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,760
<i>Oh, beautiful, Haley.</i>

16
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,160
<i>Good morning on</i>
<i>what is sure to be a windy one.</i>

17
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,320
<i>We have a high wind warning</i>
<i>for the L.A. County coast and valleys</i>

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,680
<i>with some clouds sure to come</i>
<i>in around 10.00am.</i>

19
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,200
<i>And even though</i>
<i>the high gust warning will expire</i>

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,160
<i>mid to late morning,</i>
<i>you'll still want to keep...</i>

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,520
<i>The search</i>
<i>for a group of missing hikers</i>

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,000
<i>is set to resume this morning</i>
<i>just outside Agua Dulce.</i>

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,800
<i>The tour group went out two days ago</i>
<i>and on the Pacific Crest Trail</i>

24
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,600
<i>but didn't come back</i>
<i>as expected that night.</i>

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,040
<i>Crews started searching</i>
<i>yesterday morning...</i>

26
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,880
<i>And traffic is already backed up</i>

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
<i>due to an accident</i>
<i>on the southbound 101.</i>

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,600
<i>It is 7:44 with Bo and Ives.</i>

29
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Bang.

30
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
Bang.

31
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
Bang.

32
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
Come on.

33
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,720
Down, down.

34
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,240
Down, down.

35
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,680
Bang! Yes, a good boy.

36
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
Up. Up, up.

37
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,040
Okay, up. Up.

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,440
Got to keep our heads up
out the clouds on this one.

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
I know.

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,000
Now, we land this...

41
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,320
Yeah. Like<i> Six Guns.</i>

42
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,560
I mean, we really put on a show, well

43
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,200
you know they're gonna
bring us back for the sequel.

44
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,120
Well, we sure as hell ain't
got to sell no more horses.

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,600
So just execute.

46
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,120
And we ain't got no more problems.

47
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
You good?

48
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
You good?

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,120
Where your sister?

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,880
What's that about?

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,520
- She's supposed to be here.
- Yeah.

52
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,920
Goddamn it.

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,400
Thought I told you
to fix the damn walker.

54
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,320
You hear that?

55
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Pops.

56
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,320
- Come on, come on. Pop.
- Firefly.

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,320
- What else? What else?
- Ghost.

58
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,920
Beethoven.

59
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,880
- Commodore.
- Yeah.

60
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,880
Virgil.

61
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
You good. You good.

62
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,640
You good. You good.

63
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,440
- You good, man. You good. You good.
- Ghost.

64
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,920
You good. You good. Pops?

65
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,680
- Lucky.
- Pops.

66
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,280
- Pops. Pops!
- Commodore.

67
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
OJ.

68
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
- Oh. Hi, horsie.
- Hey, hey, hey.

69
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,200
Don't look him in the eyes, please.

70
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,680
Okay. You ready
to do the safety meeting?

71
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm gonna need like five...

72
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,640
My team's almost here.

73
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
Your team's not here. Okay. Hold.

74
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,160
Sorry, I got the horse guy
talking to me, too.

75
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
- What's up? Copy.
- Safety meeting at the...

76
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,080
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ms. Bonnie Clayton on set.

77
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,800
Here she is, everybody.

78
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,200
Take a look at all of that.

79
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,720
Fynn, this is OJ, our horse trainer.

80
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,480
You remember these guys
from<i> Flash Point.</i>

81
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Yeah. Hi.

82
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,760
Your name is OJ?

83
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Yeah, Otis Junior.

84
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,120
Where's the other guy?

85
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,000
- The-the-the senior guy?
- Dude, he died.

86
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,360
About six months ago.

87
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,560
A bunch of random shit
fell out of a plane.

88
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,480
So I guess we're stuck
with Junior over here.

89
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,120
- No.
- Yeah.

90
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Okay.

91
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,800
Fuck. Great.

92
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,520
Ant, how we looking?

93
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,560
Yeah, good,
if we're selling a horse's ass.

94
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,160
That's legendary cinematographer
Antlers Holst over here...

95
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,360
Let's go ahead
and spin the horse.

96
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
But you had said "hold," so...

97
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,000
And now I'm saying "spin." Let's go.

98
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,920
Great. And while that's spinning,
can we get makeup?

99
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,560
Get makeup for
Ms. Bonnie Clayton, please.

100
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,120
Hold on.

101
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,000
Can you step away
from the back, please?

102
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,680
- They told me to come here.
- Good call, OJ.

103
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,200
Tell you what,
let's do a quick safety meeting.

104
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,920
Guys, this is OJ, our horse trainer.

105
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,320
Take it away.

106
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,200
Kill the music, please.

107
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,280
My name is OJ.

108
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,920
I think my sister's gonna
be here in a minute.

109
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,400
Little louder, please.
We cannot hear you in the back.

110
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,520
I said we are animal wranglers

111
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,640
with Haywood Hollywood Horses. And...

112
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,840
did you know the very first

113
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,960
- assem...
- Hey, yo!

114
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,480
Excuse me. Sorry.

115
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
I'm so sorry about that.
Let me do that.

116
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Sorry, brother.

117
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,160
- Safety meeting.
- Yeah.

118
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
Hello! How y'all doing?

119
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,960
Sorry for the tardiness.

120
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,040
My name is Emerald, that's OJ,

121
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,760
and we are
your animal wranglers today

122
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,680
with Haywood Hollywood Horses.

123
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,040
Now, did you know

124
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,240
that the very first assembly of
photographs in sequential order

125
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
to create a motion picture

126
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,480
was a two-second clip
of a black man on a horse?

127
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,600
Yes, it was. Yes, it was.
Look it up.

128
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,880
Now, I know you guys know
Eadweard Muybridge

129
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,240
the grandfather of motion pictures

130
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,280
who took the pictures
that created that clip

131
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,400
but does anybody know the name of
the black jockey that rode the horse?

132
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
No.

133
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,480
Nope? I mean,
the very first stuntman

134
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
animal wrangler and movie star
all rolled into one

135
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,920
and there is literally
no record of him.

136
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,560
That man was a Bahamian jockey

137
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,080
that went by the name of
Alistair E. Haywood.

138
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,960
And he is my great-great-grandfather.

139
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,280
- Great.
- There's another "great"

140
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,400
grandfather.

141
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,080
That's why back at the Haywood Ranch

142
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,320
as the only black-owned
horse trainers in Hollywood

143
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,080
we like to say, "Since
the moment pictures could move

144
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,200
we had skin in the game."

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,120
All right, let's get into
some safety precautions

146
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,280
while we're on set, shall we?

147
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,880
Number one, please refrain

148
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,400
from making any loud noises,
sudden movements

149
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,200
and keep your cell phones off.
We'd really appreciate that.

150
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,440
Two, if you see anything
that looks or feels unsafe

151
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,920
contact me, OJ or your second
in chain of command.

152
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,600
And three, let's have a great shoot!

153
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,240
And I'm Emerald Haywood.
I direct, write, produce, act.

154
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,040
I do a little... <i>singing on the side.</i>

155
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,200
Motorcycles, baby.

156
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,120
Look, I make a mean grilled cheese
if you're looking for crafty.

157
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,640
Just... just holler at me.

158
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Okay, that was great.
That was... that was a lot.

159
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,280
Let's do a rehearsal.

160
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,400
Yeah? Rehearsal?

161
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,120
Rehearsing, we should.
We should do one. Rehearsing.

162
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,920
I think... I think
he might need a break.

163
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah, we'll rehearse one first,
and then break, yeah?

164
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,280
Well, I'm ready to do one.

165
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,920
OJ, she's ready to do one.

166
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,520
Tell the horse we're ready to do one.

167
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,200
VFX, can we get the ball
in here while we have a sec?

168
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,760
- Em.
- VFX.

169
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,600
And, OJ, you can... you can step off.

170
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
- Step out. Step off. Step out.
- Yeah, yeah.

171
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,800
Em?

172
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,120
What's the horse's name?

173
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,120
- Lucky.
- Lucky.

174
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,440
- Is he?
- VFX!

175
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Yeah. Em?

176
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,200
- OJ, let's step off.
- You calling me?

177
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,800
- Hey... hey.
- I'm trying to work.

178
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,160
What'd I tell you about that, man?

179
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,880
Hey... hey!

180
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
Medic.

181
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,440
Are you okay?

182
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,040
Look, maybe it's just too soon, huh?

183
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,720
Yeah, it's not the gig.
Not ready yet.

184
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,840
Right?

185
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,080
- We need it, man.
- No, I know.

186
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,120
Your dad left an enormous hole.
I know that.

187
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,680
But don't worry, there'll be others.

188
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
All right? I'm sorry.

189
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
- And...
- Sorry.

190
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,280
Just, you tell her sorry.

191
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,560
Thank you for the opportunity.

192
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Come on, now.

193
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,680
Oh, where's VFX?

194
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,600
Oh, all right. You got it.

195
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,640
Sorry, that was...

196
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,520
So, where am I dropping you?

197
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,200
I'm-a go up with you.

198
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,200
I need to get some shit.

199
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,560
My little girl said, you know,
I could crash at her place,

200
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,040
so I'll be gone in the morning.

201
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,400
So I'm gonna drive you back tomorrow?

202
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,520
I can find a ride.

203
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,040
But, I mean, like,
can I get fun OJ out this bitch?

204
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,200
'Cause this wack-ass OJ is really
making me feel like I'm not loved.

205
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,360
Is that how you want
your little sister to feel?

206
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,800
What happened to Gold Rush?

207
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,680
Gold Rush went bankrupt.

208
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,920
It's been this for three years.

209
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,600
Howdy, folks.
Welcome to Jupiter's Claim.

210
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,120

Look at this. I've never
seen anything like it.

I'm sorry, y'all. I'm sorry.

219
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,600
- Photo bomb.
- You ruined it.

- Yeah, my bad.
- Gold, I tell you.

221
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
They got gold up in here.

222
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Lucky.

I'll be back.

225
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,360
Let's go.

226
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,480
How many you sold?

227
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,040
How many?

228
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
Ten.

229
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,640
You sold ten of Pops' horses?

230
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,760
I'm gonna get 'em back.

231
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
- Can you stay out here?
- Why?

232
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,520
I'm developing
a business relationship

233
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,680
and you're a liability right now.

234
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,960
How am I a liability?

235
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,200
How are you a lia...

236
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,600
Don't promote
your fucking side shit on the job.

237
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,960
- Oh, my God.
- Actor, singer, dancer

238
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,760
seamstress, motorcycles.

239
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,680
You want to promote something,
promote this business.

240
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,280
No, OJ. No.

241
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,920
First of all, that's not
my side shit. This is.

242
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,520
And second of all,
if anybody's a liability...

243
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,160
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

244
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,080
Hi there. It's Amber again
from Jupe's Claim.

245
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,320
It does look like we were able

246
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,680
to squeeze out
a couple of extra press passes

247
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,880
for the upcoming
friends and family preview.

248
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,600
Oh. No apology necessary.

249
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,640
This is in reference to the biggest,
bestest, brand-new live show

250
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,320
we have coming up here at the park

251
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,000
- which is sneaking up on us...
- Come in.

252
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,960
If you'd like, I can
go ahead and put you down...

253
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,080
OJ.

254
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
Thanks for coming up.

255
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,200
How you doing?
This is my sister Em.

256
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Hi there.

257
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,960
So...

258
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,200
- who'd you bring me?
- Lucky.

259
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,400
He's my second-best horse,
you know...

260
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,040
He lost focus.

261
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,440
So...

262
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,960
I mean, I did, too,
but I can't fire myself.

263
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
That's good.

264
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,680
Hold up. This you?

265
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,440
You literally the Asian kid
from<i> Kid Sheriff?</i>

266
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,040
- Em... Em.
- No, it's okay.

267
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,400
Yeah, I was... I was Lil' Jupe.

268
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,280
Ah, dude, you were
literally my favorite.

269
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,800
You mind if I get
a picture real quick?

270
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,200
Hey, you mind if we talk?

271
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,520
Yes. Of course.

272
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,480
Please, browse away.

273
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,600
<i>Su casa es mi casa.</i>

274
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,400
Thank you. I sure will.

275
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So...

276
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,920
same deal, yeah? Eleven-five?

277
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,200
- Yeah. Thank you.
- That's 3D. Yeah.

278
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,680
Whatever happened
to that black boy? He was good.

279
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,800
Stop, stop.

280
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
He was good.

281
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,000
I actually wanted
to lay some groundwork

282
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,520
to a pathway of...
buying some of them back.

283
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
All right?

284
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Yeah.

285
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,200
Yeah. Totally.

286
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,800
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

287
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,920
Actually

288
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,120
OJ, the offer I made your dad
is still on the table.

289
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,520
- Let me... Let...
- Yo, wait a minute.

290
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,760
So, that...

291
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,000
OJ, have I shown you this?

292
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,000
This is in reference
to the<i> Gordy's Home</i> incident.

293
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,360
<i>Gordy's Home.</i> Yeah, yeah.

294
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,520
So,<i> Gordy's Home</i> is
a short-lived but fabled sitcom

295
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,000
I starred in in '96
after<i> Kid Sheriff</i> blew up.

296
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,600
Yeah, my pops told me
about this show.

297
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,000
The monkey went crazy
or some shit.

298
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,440
You know, I usually charge
a fee for this.

299
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Oh, damn.

300
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Ta-da.

301
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
That's the first exploding fist bump.

302
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,160
What? Really?

303
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,520
Y'all came up with that?

304
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,080
So, as I was saying, <i>Gordy's Home</i>
began airing in the fall of '96

305
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,080
and it was an immediate hit.

306
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,040
Ratings were huge.

307
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,400
Pretty good reviews.

308
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,520
Just really took off.

309
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Yeah.

310
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,120
Then, one day...

311
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,640
we were shooting an episode

312
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,080
in season two
entitled <i>Gordy's Birthday.</i>

313
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
And...

314
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
boom.

315
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,000
One of the chimps
that plays Gordy just...

316
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,160
just hit his limit.

317
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,520
And it was six minutes
and 13 seconds of havoc.

318
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,160
Network tried to bury hit,
but it was a spectacle.

319
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,680
People are just obsessed.

320
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
You're kidding me.

321
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,840
OJ, you said you heard about that?

322
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,760
That's why
they don't let you use chimps.

323
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,360
That's part of the reason.

324
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,760
There's a growing<i> Gordy's Home</i>
fan base out there now.

325
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,080
This Dutch couple paid me 50K
to come in here and spend the night.

326
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
I didn't ask.

327
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
That's crazy.

328
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,200
So, what happened really, man?

329
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,120
You haven't seen
the Bad Gordy sketch on<i> SNL?</i>

330
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,680
I mean, they pretty much
nailed it better than I could.

331
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,080
No?

332
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,920
<i>Saturday Night Live?</i>

333
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,120
Darrell Hammond as Tom.

334
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,880
Ana Gasteyer as Phyllis.

335
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,600
Cheri Oteri as Mary Jo Elliot.

336
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,120
Scott Wolf is the host. He's me.

337
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
But, of course,
the star of the sketch

338
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,240
is Chris goddamn Kattan as Gordy

339
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,560
and he is...

340
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,520
undeniable, okay?

341
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,800
Bit goes like this.

342
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,520
Everyone's trying
to celebrate Gordy's birthday

343
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,200
but every time Gordy hears
something about the jungle

344
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,800
Gordy... Kattan... goes off.

345
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
And it's... it's Kattan.

346
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,880
He's just crushing it.

347
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,800
He is a force of nature.
He is killing on that stage.

348
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,080
Yeah.

349
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,760
It's legendary.

350
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,120
Legendary shit.

351
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,600
Yeah.

352
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go ahead,
look that one up on YouTube.

353
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,320
Details, you know?

354
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,760
Totally.

355
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,960
I got some work I got to do.

356
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,200
So we ain't gonna chill
tonight, nothing?

357
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
You want to work?

358
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Hell no.

359
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,760
So, what was the offer?

360
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,800
- Jupe?
- Yeah.

361
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,640
He offered to buy the ranch.

362
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,760
Oh, really?

363
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,800
That's interesting. How much?

364
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Why?

365
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,360
'Cause I'm trying to see
how big of a dumb-ass you are.

366
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,880
Big dumb-ass, probably.

367
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So I guess you don't want to see

368
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,640
what's good with
Dad liquor cabinet, then, huh?

369
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,720
I got that hobby weed, too, actually.

370
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,160
That's all you had to say, then.

371
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,080
The hobby weed.

372
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,320
That's all you had to say,
just let me know.

373
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,920
You should've dropped that
at the top.

374
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,000
"I got the hobby weed."
You know I'm ready.

375
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,080
Okay, your reflexes
are still quick. Like, whoa.

376
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,640
I ain't mad at it.

377
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I'm watching.

378
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,800
To the man.

379
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Drink.

380
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,200
Oh, shit.

381
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,880
Remember Jean Jacket?

382
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,600
Yeah, good horse.

383
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,000
Supposed to be
my first horse, actually.

384
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,440
I was just talking to my therapist
about this not too long ago.

385
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,560
Therapist?

386
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,040
Yes. I fuck one
on occasion sometimes.

387
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,280
I was telling her that

388
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
for my ninth birthday

389
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,320
I was supposed to get
to train Jean Jacket.

390
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But then Pops got some Western, and

391
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,760
Jean Jacket wasn't mine no more.

392
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,640
Classic Otis Senior.

393
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,200
I distinctly remember...

394
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,920
standing right here at this window,
watching y'all train my horse.

395
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,680
My horse.

396
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,320
Pops never looked up at me.

397
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,920
Whoa, now. Whoa, now. Whoa, now.

398
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,200
OJ, come on.

399
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,520
But you did, nigga.

400
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,520
Remember?

401
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,000
It was<i> Scorpion King,</i> actually.

402
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,240
It wasn't a Western.

403
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,920
That was the first job
Pops took me on.

404
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,560
Wasn't much fun.

405
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,160
Ended up using camels anyways, so...

406
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,760
The point is...

407
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,120
Yeah, fuck the point.

408
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,400
Yo, that man was
hardheaded as fuck.

409
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,920
And so are you.

410
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
That's it.

411
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,520
But at the end of the day,
you got to...

412
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,360
you got to admit, man, Pops...

413
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,160
Pops did something
when he made this place.

414
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,160
He changed the industry.

415
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,440
That's real.

416
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,560
I can't just let that go.

417
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,520
Why is Ghost in the arena?

418
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,640
What's good?

419
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Yeah.

420
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,800
Hey, yo, Em. Em!

421
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,520
Turn it down!

422
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,360
All right!

423
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
Hey!

424
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,200
Where he going?

425
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,040
<i>What if I...</i>

426
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,720
<i>What if I told you...</i>

427
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,960
<i>you'll leave here different?</i>

428
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,480
<i>See, every Friday</i>
<i>for the last six months...</i>

429
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,200
<i>my family and I bore witness</i>

430
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,000
<i>to an absolute spectacle.</i>

431
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,200
You see it? The power?

432
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,640
Where's Ghost?

433
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,240
- I don't know.
- Hold on.

434
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,360
Boom. Power went out.

435
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,520
- See?
- Rewind.

436
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
Stop.

437
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,280
Ghost talking about,
"I ain't listening.

438
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,680
I'm not trained.
I do whatever the fuck I want."

439
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,120
What?

440
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,160
What'd you see?

441
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,160
What's a bad miracle?

442
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,360
They got a word for that?

443
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Nope.

444
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,920
They said it was a prop plane
or something that killed Pops.

445
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,400
That shit ain't never
made sense to me.

446
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,400
Then tonight,
I heard Ghost make a sound

447
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,600
I ain't never heard a horse make.

448
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,720
What did you see?

449
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
It was big.

450
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,400
- How big?
- Big.

451
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,880
- What'd it look like?
- I don't know.

452
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,360
It was fast.

453
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,800
Too fast.

454
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,480
Too quiet to be a plane.

455
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
OJ.

456
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,680
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

457
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,080
I'm telling you, man,
we don't need a lot.

458
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,400
We just need enough to make our shit
look different from what's out there.

459
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,560
You get what I'm saying? Like...

460
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,320
You know I ain't trying to run it up.

461
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,000
I just was looking online,
and I seen a lot of shit.

462
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,880
You know I'm broke, right?

463
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
We'll use my money.

464
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Okay, shut up. Look.

465
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
All right.

466
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,280
There it is. Five to a hundred K.

467
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,960
- Well, read it.
- You read it, dyslexic ass.

468
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,800
The point is
a website like Cyber Dominion

469
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,200
will pay five to a hundred K

470
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,560
for photographic evidence
of UFOs and shit.

471
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,680
A hundred K?

472
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,360
And that's just
what I saw on the first go.

473
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,440
Now that I'm thinking about it,
fuck Cyber Dominion.

474
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,720
This shit right here is
a moment... our moment.

475
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,680
We set it up,
release it the right way

476
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,120
man, I'm talking
rich and famous for life.

477
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,920
How you doing? You look pretty.

478
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,600
- She look like she got a big house.
- How?

479
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,160
How what? How we put it out?

480
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,360
Well, that's what I'm saying.

481
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,000
We don't just go for
the quick cash-in, okay?

482
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,560
We go to the most credible platform
to do the story.

483
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
What's that? Like<i> Oprah?</i>

484
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,640
Yeah. Like<i> Oprah,</i> for example.
After that, everybody want in.

485
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Well, I'm saying there's plenty
of videos of flying shit online.

486
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,480
I saw one the other day.
That wasn't on<i> Oprah.</i>

487
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,480
Nigga, I didn't say<i> Oprah.</i>
You said<i> Oprah.</i>

488
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,640
You love<i> Oprah.</i>

489
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,120
Look, all I'm saying is
all that shit online is fake.

490
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,360
Low quality. Ain't nobody
gonna get what we gonna get.

491
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,080
- What we gonna get?
- The shot.

492
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
What shot?

493
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,040
The shot. The money shot.

494
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,680
Undeniable, singular, the...

495
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,400
the<i> Oprah</i> shot.

496
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,040
The<i> Oprah</i> shot?

497
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,640
Excuse me.

498
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,520
Hi. I can help you over here.

499
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Hi.

500
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,720
Thank you for shopping at Fry's.

501
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,640
Did you guys find everything
you're looking for today?

502
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,440
Yes... Angel.

503
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,960
Great.

504
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
Actually, do you have a card with us?

505
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
No, thank you.

506
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,680
- Would you like one? Because it...
- No, thank you.

507
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,720
Would you like one of
our tech support personnel

508
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
to help you with the installation?

509
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
No... no, thank you.

510
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Appreciate you.

511
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,000
All right, no help with the install.

512
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Suit yourself.

513
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,000
Is it a hard install?

514
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
For me, no.

515
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,800
You're not gonna be able to do it.

516
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,960
What happened?
Did you guys get robbed?

517
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,720
Yeah, you know.

518
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,000
A lot of blackouts.

519
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,760
Take the camera out
from time to time.

520
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,720
All these new cameras,
they have backup battery power

521
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,880
so you should be fine.

522
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,000
But the outages affect
the power in the battery shit, too

523
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,200
like cell phones.

524
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,720
Okay. All right.

525
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,200
Cell phones, they don't just
drop in power. Right?

526
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,000
I mean, maybe your Wi-Fi drops out
whenever your system dips.

527
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,520
So, that's technology.

528
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,040
Okay, or maybe
you're in a UFO hot spot.

529
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,000
No one believes in that.

530
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
What's up?

531
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,880
Damn. Did not realize
you guys were this far out.

532
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,560
I don't mind, though.

533
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,560
Smell of horse shit and fresh air.

534
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,040
Right?

535
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,920
Whoa... whoa.

536
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,200
Whoa. Look at me, man.

537
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,760
- Fuck.
- Don't do that. Don't yell.

538
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Sorry, man.

539
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,400
Sorry if I was, like,
a little shut down this morning.

540
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,520
Just got out of
a four-year relationship.

541
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
You were fine.

542
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,600
I know it's gonna sound
fucking cliché, all right

543
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,920
but I thought that
she was the one, you know?

544
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,520
Is this gonna take
longer than an hour?

545
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,960
This?

546
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Oh, shit, yeah.

547
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,440
- I'm-a go ahead and pop out.
- Where you going?

548
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,680
I got to go to the store
and get something.

549
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,120
Don't worry about it.
You need anything?

550
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,480
Yo.

551
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,120
Her name was Rebecca Diaz.

552
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,320
Yep, keep an eye out for her.

553
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,880
She's an actress, model, you know?

554
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,800
She booked a pilot on The CW, so...

555
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,200
Yeah, fucking left me.

556
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,520
Yeah, fucking CW.

557
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,760
- So, thing about this camera...
- Actually, can it swivel up?

558
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
Yeah.

559
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,680
- Boom.
- Little more?

560
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,680
More. Okay.

561
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,720
Yeah.

562
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
Yeah.

563
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,520
Do you know
they don't call 'em UFOs anymore?

564
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,880
It's fucking UAPs now.

565
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,760
Why they got to change the name?

566
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
Yeah.

567
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
Exactly.

568
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,880
No, fuck it. I'll tell you why
they changed the name, all right?

569
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,120
It-it's 'cause they want
to keep us in the dark.

570
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,160
Remember when they declassified all
that UFO footage a couple years ago?

571
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,720
Yeah. Well, people started
paying attention.

572
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,560
So they changed the name to UAPs.

573
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,040
And no one knows
what the fuck a UAP is

574
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,520
so everyone lost interest.

575
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,120
I saw that... that Navy clip.

576
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,320
Couldn't really see 'em, though.

577
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Could've been better.

578
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,400
It's shitty footage of exact proof

579
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,160
that there's an alien civilization
out there in the universe.

580
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,760
So, who's that?

581
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,880
Come on, man.
The little guys with the big eyes.

582
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,040
Yeah. There's lots of theories.

583
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,320
Either they're intergalactic
travelers looking for peace

584
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,720
or futuristic humans
coming back in time

585
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,520
to stop us from destroying the planet

586
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,680
or they're fucking world killers.

587
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,800
Planetary destroyers.

588
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,920
And that means that
they've been fucking watching us

589
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and studying us, waiting for
the perfect time to beam us up

590
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,640
and shove metal probes
up our fucking asses.

591
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
Cool.

592
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,120
Anyway,<i> Ancient Aliens,</i>
History Channel.

593
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,800
- Watch that shit.
- Hey!

594
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,720
Hey!

595
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,400
Come on! Help a nigga out!

596
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Hey.

597
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,400
Know where I could find me
a couple of big, strong fellas?

598
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
You good?

599
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,960
I'm good.

600
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,320
- What?
- What's that?

601
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
Oh, this?

602
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,360
You know, just training
horses we ordered that I picked up.

603
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440
Where'd you get it from?

604
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
Don't worry about it.

605
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,120
Now, come on, help me out.

606
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Got you.

607
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,200
Okay, so what is that?

608
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,000
- Is it like bait?
- I told you.

609
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,720
It is a decoy for horse training.

610
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Okay.

611
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,360
Shit.

612
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,040
- Shit.
- See?

613
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
OJ.

614
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,640
We good. I mean, he don't know shit.

615
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,800
Oh, no. You guys are doing
something shady.

616
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,520
Hey there!

617
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
Hey!

618
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,240
You can stay right there, though!

619
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,160
Sure!

620
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
What's up?

621
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,760
We're setting up a decoy!

622
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,800
For horse training!

623
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,560
Oh, good!

624
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,680
You know, we got some of those!

625
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,120
- Where'd you get...
- Where'd you get yours?

626
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,320
Yeah... I'm not really sure!

627
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,920
My wife would know!

628
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,640
- Okay! Thanks for stopping by!
- Why the...

629
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,920
You don't live here.

630
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,320
Sorry. Trying to help.

631
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Sure thing!

632
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,760
Hey. I wanted to invite you to our...

633
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,240
new family live show!

634
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,800
Friday! At 5.00pm!

635
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,960
Okay!

636
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,880
Thumbs u... thumbs up.

637
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
Should I do it?

638
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,680
Yeah, do it.

639
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,920
Thumbs up!

640
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,920
And so, the router's in the shed.

641
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,480
I set it up so if the power
goes down on camera A

642
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,120
camera B's pointed
at the sky to catch

643
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,520
whatever might have taken it out.

644
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,840
And vice versa, so...

645
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Thank you.

646
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,200
I mean, you're really not gonna
tell me what the fuck is going on?

647
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,600
You'll know soon enough.

648
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Cool, cryptic.

649
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Fucking dicks.

650
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,680
I can monitor the feeds remotely
myself, if you want. Free of charge.

651
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,880
- Hell no.
- No.

652
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,880
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

653
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,320
One more thing.

654
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,360
You'll be getting a call
from my supervisor asking

655
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,400
- how my service was.
- Five stars, Angel. Five stars.

656
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,680
Thank you.

657
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,440
So, what now?

658
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,920
I don't know. What you want to do?

659
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,080
I'm... Whatever you want to do.

660
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,120
Well, I got some work I got to do.
I'm gonna go out...

661
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
That's a good one.

662
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,880
<i>I'm talking today to women who say</i>

663
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,880
<i>they have been abducted</i>
<i>by aliens from another planet.</i>

664
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,680
<i>May I briefly say,</i>
<i>I don't know for a fact</i>

665
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,800
<i>that they're from another planet.</i>

666
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,160
<i>Well, you know you weren't</i>
<i>in Kansas anymore, Toto.</i>

667
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,560
<i>And I wasn't wearing red shoes that</i>

668
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,320
<i>- I could click together, either.</i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

669
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
Nope.

670
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
Nope, I'm out.

671
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,080
I'm going. Fuck this shit.

672
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,080
Okay. Okay.

673
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,400
Oh, shit!

674
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,520
Fuck off.

675
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,000
Give us back our property.

676
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,600
Don't mess with Jupiter's Claim!

677
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,680
Come on.

678
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,360
What happened?

679
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,040
The Park kids.

680
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,760
Jupe's sons.

681
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,280
And they let Clover out, man.

682
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,480
What? They trying to prank Haywood?

683
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,680
- It's on!
- Hey. You stole their horse.

684
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,480
Yeah.

685
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,400
- Hey.
- Shit.

686
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,000
What's up, Nessie?

687
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,160
Not much. Just stocking shit.
You know, pretty much regular.

688
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,600
Oh, shit!

689
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,040
I need to take my ass to bed.

690
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,400
- Who this?
- <i>Yo, it's Angel from Fry's.</i>

691
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,960
Just calling to tell you that
there is a bug on camera A.

692
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,600
<i>I know. Wait, I thought</i>
<i>I told you not to watch our shit.</i>

693
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
Yeah, I know, I know.

694
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,800
- <i>Camera B is down.</i>
- What?

695
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,040
<i>Camera B is down.</i>

696
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,040
<i>Like</i> Ancient-fucking-Aliens <i>down</i>.

697
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,480
- Hey!
- <i>Hey. Hi. Emerald</i>

698
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,240
can you please
get the bug off the thing?

699
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,360
Get the bug off
the fucking thing!

700
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,360
Shit.

701
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,640
<i>What do you see?</i>
<i>Do you see, like, lights or anything?</i>

702
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,520
<i>Like, a-a fucking saucer?</i>

703
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,640
It's in the cloud.

704
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It's in the cloud.

705
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,800
OJ! It's in the cloud!

706
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,560
Yeah, nah, nah, nah.

707
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,120
Run, OJ! Run!

708
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,280
Shit.

709
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,960
Hello?

710
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,360
What happened to OJ?

711
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,880
It's fine.

712
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,560
Come on.

713
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,320
Okay, it's still on.

714
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,520
The camera, it's still on.

715
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Shit... shit.

716
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,080
Okay, you fucking praying mantis.

717
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
All right, bitch.

718
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,880
You like Sour Patch Kids?

719
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,120
Huh?

720
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,160
A'ight, man.

721
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,800
Where your shit? Let's go.

722
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,080
Haven't seen one of those
in a minute.

723
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,240
Fucking praying mantis.

724
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,800
That motherfucker better pray
I don't ever see him

725
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,640
'cause if I do, I'm-a eat him.

726
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,640
- Let's go.
- Where?

727
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,080
I don't know.

728
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,120
I got me
a little situation in Atwater

729
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,360
texting me back right now.

730
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,560
It's not coming again tonight.

731
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,680
I don't care.

732
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,200
No. No.

733
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,880
No.

734
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,520
Bro, I ain't never seen
no shit like this.

735
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,800
It ain't worth it.

736
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,280
No, nope. It's too much.

737
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,720
You should go, then.

738
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,640
I got to get up early anyway.

739
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,680
I got mouths to feed.

740
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,360
Shit.

741
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,120
Shit, shit, shit!

742
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,120
You hear that?

743
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,160
Ghost out there.

744
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,400
Acting all territorial.

745
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,280
I guess some animals
ain't fit to be trained.

746
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,400
- Hello?
- <i>Hi.</i>

747
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,200
<i>Is this Antlers Holst?</i>

748
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,400
Who's this?

749
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,520
Hey, yeah. I'm Emerald Haywood.

750
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,400
We met a couple days ago
at the commercial.

751
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,320
<i>Oh, yeah, horse girl. Sure.</i>

752
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,480
<i>I remember you and your brother.</i>

753
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,200
Yeah, horse boy.

754
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,920
He's here, too.

755
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,200
- <i>The descendants of the jockey.</i>
- Yeah.

756
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,360
<i>Guess I'm talking to</i>
<i>motion picture royalty, then.</i>

757
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,320
<i>How'd you get the number?</i>

758
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,000
I got it from the call sheet.

759
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,920
So, we have a project, and

760
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,120
<i>you know, what if I told you</i>
<i>it was the offer of a lifetime?</i>

761
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,800
Yeah, hopefully not my lifetime.

762
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,520
That's a good one.

763
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,720
I'm-a be real with you. We don't have
a lot of money to pay you up front

764
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,440
you know, not like
you're used to, but...

765
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,800
<i>Yeah. I tend to do one for them</i>
<i>so I can do one for me</i>

766
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,680
<i>so what is it?</i>

767
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,880
- Reality.
- <i>Oh, no. Reality.</i>

768
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,000
Documentary.

769
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,400
Doc-Documentary.

770
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,040
<i>Oh, that's better.</i>

771
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,360
<i>So, again, what's it about?</i>

772
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,760
It's about the shit
dreams is made of, baby.

773
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,640
<i>Listen, horse girl.</i>

774
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,520
I got a...

775
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,120
pretty damn superb lemon tart
in the oven I'm about to serve

776
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,360
<i>to ten of my closest friends, so...</i>

777
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,360
Stop... stop.

778
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,240
Oh, hold on one second. What?

779
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,320
He's not here for that.

780
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,160
- <i>Look, look, no. This is what I do.</i>
- <i>Don't be cute. Stick to the plan.</i>

781
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,240
- <i>I don't go to your job and knock</i>
- <i>Say it!</i>

782
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,040
<i>a horse's dick out your damn hand.</i>

783
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,440
- Hello?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

784
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,120
Yeah, my bad. We good, man.

785
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,160
According to <i>American Cinema</i> magazine

786
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,880
<i>you make the cinematically</i>
<i>impossible possible.</i>

787
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,480
<i>Well, we looking</i>
<i>for the impossible shot.</i>

788
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,120
That's impossible.

789
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,320
<i>Antlers.</i>

790
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,920
There's something
out here in Agua Dulce

791
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,360
and you're probably
the only person in the world

792
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,680
that can get it on film.

793
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,960
That's it.

794
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,760
<i>Horse girl, this dream you're chasing</i>

795
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,360
<i>the one where you end up</i>
<i>at the top of the mountain</i>

796
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,200
<i>all eyes on you...</i>

797
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,080
it's the dream
you never wake up from.

798
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
I don't like him.

799
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,760
Holy shit. It's real.

800
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,200
I don't know
what you're doing here, but...

801
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,000
it was illegal for you to...

802
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,520
spy on us like that.

803
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,320
Wait, you... you don't know?

804
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,640
Okay, tell me when you see it.

805
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,640
There.

806
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,520
- Doesn't move.
- Exactly.

807
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,000
Well, look at that.

808
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,880
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay.

809
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,840
I went back
and scrubbed through the footage

810
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,240
and that cloud has been right there
at least since I set the cameras up.

811
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,800
Yeah, now you mention it

812
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,360
I've probably been looking
at the same damn cloud every day

813
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,680
for the last six months.

814
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,960
Shit.

815
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,000
So, I mean, that's them in there.

816
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,640
And we've been recording it,
so we got it. Right?

817
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,680
Yeah.

818
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,520
Why you saying "yeah" like that?

819
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,120
I mean, we have proof
of aliens on video. I...

820
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,680
Yeah, I wouldn't call it proof.

821
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,200
Are you serious?

822
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,360
Look, I've seen crazy
weather phenomenons online before.

823
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,120
- That's all I'm saying.
- He's right.

824
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,200
It's good, but it ain't it.
Ain't<i> Oprah.</i>

825
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,360
Ain't<i> Oprah.</i>

826
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,080
Okay.

827
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,040
Are you guys telling me

828
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,480
that there's an alien spaceship

829
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,760
in that fucking cloud right there?

830
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,800
It doesn't move like a ship.

831
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,920
What you mean, OJ?

832
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,680
What if it's not a ship?

833
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,120
All right, Gordy,
we're almost ready, buddy.

834
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,320
Here we go, buddy. Come on.

835
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,240
- He's ready.
- Set.

836
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,960
Here we go.

837
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,560
And... action.

838
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,600
And, of course,
I set it to Icelandic time

839
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,560
because we share
a love of the aurora borealis, Gordy.

840
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,080
And you have no idea
how to tell time.

841
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,920
Great gift, Dad.
Way to think things through.

842
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,400
Somehow, you'd think that a man
who can send a rocket into space

843
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,080
would be able to manage
a halfway decent birthday present.

844
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,520
Nope.

845
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,680
You know, Gordy,
all things considered

846
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,240
maybe my gift isn't so bad after all.

847
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,640
Hey, Gordy.

848
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,400
- Surprise!
- Wow.

849
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,240
Now, that is a gift.

850
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,440
Oh. Sorry. My...

851
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,760
That's all right.
Pick it up from there.

852
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,640
Wait a minute. What happened to we
both failed at finding good presents?

853
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,880
Here you go, Gordy. Happy birthday.

854
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,000
Oh, beautiful, Hayley.

855
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,560
Hey, hey, hey. No!

856
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,920
No, no! Down! Down! Gordy!

857
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,200
No. Stop! Stop!

858
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,320
Oh, no... no.

859
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,000
Gordy, no! No!

860
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,720
Down! Down! Down!

861
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,120
You sit! Down.

862
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,400
No, no, no.

863
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,400
No... no!

864
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,680
No, Gordy!

865
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,720
Stop!

866
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,080
No! No!

867
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,120
Seven just on scene... Oh, my God.

868
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,520
Feeling good?

869
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,000
Yeah.

870
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,760
Feeling good.

871
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,880
Good.

872
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,400
There we go.

873
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,880
Run it. Run it one more time, babe.

874
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,120
Okay.

875
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,640
What if I told you...

876
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,360
Yo.

877
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,000
It's... Storm's coming.

878
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,880
Just tarping up, just to be safe.

879
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,160
Hey, where you going?

880
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,560
I'm-a get Lucky.

881
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,120
Now, we're not gonna let a few clouds
kill our fun today, are we, folks?

882
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,200
So, without further ado

883
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:37,000
welcome to the Jupiter's Claim
Star Lasso Experience!

884
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,680
How's everyone feeling today?

885
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,560
All right.

886
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,640
It's quite a doozy today.

887
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,000
I want to thank you guys
for coming out here.

888
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,400
But first, how about
another round of applause

889
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,480
for my Amber?

890
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,880
I'll tell you, that woman is a saint
for putting up with all my craziness.

891
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,360
And to the knuckleheads up there.

892
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,200
The staff. Shout-out.

893
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,040
All right, all right. That's enough.

894
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,480
I also want to give
a special thanks to

895
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,080
an old costar of mine
and my first crush

896
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,120
Mary Jo Elliott, everyone!

897
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,320
Yeah.

898
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,680
All right.

899
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,080
You ready?

900
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,320
Oh, come on. That ain't nothing.

901
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,000
Are you ready?

902
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,200
Here we go.

903
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,600
You're chosen.

904
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,480
What if I told you...

905
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,200
that in about an hour...

906
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,000
you'll leave here different?

907
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,800
See, every Friday
for the last six months

908
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,520
my family and I have bore witness

909
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,640
to an absolute spectacle.

910
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,560
One that you'll be seeing here today.

911
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,360
So let me take you back
to that first night.

912
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,160
Right here in this exact spot

913
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,760
I'd come over to wrangle
a chestnut horse named Trigger.

914
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,560
Now, I could barely see my hand
in front of my face for the fog

915
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,880
but I swear

916
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,400
on my wife and children's lives

917
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,920
that at 6.13pm

918
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,920
I see...

919
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,280
a flying saucer

920
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,560
descend through the mist.

921
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,680
Old Trigger took off
straight into the gulch.

922
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,440
And, well...

923
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,480
it's like he was going home.

924
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,320
Now, just to be clear

925
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,160
what we saw was a flying saucer.

926
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,600
No doubt about that.

927
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,400
Slightly flatter in the front

928
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,880
with a circular hole in the bottom
about two school bus lengths wide.

929
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,200
Ladies and gentlemen, I kid you not.

930
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,920
We are being surveilled

931
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,520
by an alien species
I call "the Viewers."

932
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,160
And though they have yet
to emerge from their ship

933
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,400
I believe they trust me.

934
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,360
If they didn't

935
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,880
I don't think any of us
would be here right now.

936
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,520
So, as I said, in just under an hour

937
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:55,680
Star Lasso Experience
is gonna change you.

938
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,880
But first, my boys are gonna come out
and do a little number for us.

939
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,960
Would that be all right?

940
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,040
Hustle. Go, go, go.

941
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
All right. My little satellites:
Colton, Phoenix, Max.

942
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,560
Remember those names, folks.

943
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,240
All right, here we go!

944
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,320
What is that?

945
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,320
Do you guys see that?

946
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,840
Stay in your seats.

947
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,680
This is new.

948
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,880
They're early.

949
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,320
They're giving us a real show today.

950
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,040
That they are.
They're giving us a real show today.

951
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,800
They're ready, we're ready.

952
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:58,440

977
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,640
Lucky.

978
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,840
Lucky.

979
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,720
Lucky, come on, come on. Come on!

980
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,360
Come on, come on, come on. Lucky.

981
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,560
Come on... come on.

982
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,720
Yo. It's done.

983
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,200
All right, I'll be over
in the morning to tear that shit off.

984
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,560
Or you guys can do it yourselves.

985
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,800
- It's all the same.
- No, no.

986
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,120
I like when you do it.

987
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,480
Of course you do.

988
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,480
All right. See you tomorrow.

989
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:21,760
See you.

990
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,120
Pick up... pick up.

991
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,720
Come on, come on.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

992
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,400
<i>Did you know that the very first</i>
<i>assembly of photographs</i>

993
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,400
<i>in sequential order</i>
<i>to make a motion picture</i>

994
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,920
<i>was a two-second clip</i>
<i>of a black man on a horse?</i>

995
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,640
<i>That man was a Bahamian jockey</i>
<i>known as Alistair E. Haywood</i>

996
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,560
<i>and he was</i>
<i>my great-great-grandfather.</i>

997
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,680
- Hey.
- <i>Em.</i>

998
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:02,920
<i>I was right.</i>

999
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,560
<i>It's not a ship.</i>

1000
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,240
What happened?

1001
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,520
What the fuck?

1002
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,280
Shit.

1003
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,280
It ate them, Em.

1004
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,160
It ate them all.

1005
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,760
<i>It's alive, Em. It's an animal.</i>

1006
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,480
<i>It's territorial, and it thinks</i>
<i>that this is its home.</i>

1007
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:45,960
Em!

1008
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,760
Oh, fuck.

1009
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,240
Oh, shit.

1010
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:57,680
Ooh, yes.

1011
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,800
Hey, hey. We're in trouble. Okay?

1012
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:05,760
Shit.

1013
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,440
What?

1014
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:37,680
What the fuck?

1015
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,880
What the fuck?

1016
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,800
Who the hell is that?

1017
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,520
Who the hell is that?

1018
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,720
Em!

1019
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,400
- Who the hell is that?
- Fuck.

1020
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:55,800
It's above us.

1021
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,200
Ah, shit!

1022
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,000
Shit.

1023
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,680
Oh, shit! What the fuck?

1024
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,760
Oh, God.

1025
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,640
Something very bad is happening.

1026
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,680
Fuck!

1027
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,800
Yeah, we're fucked.

1028
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,840
Nope.

1029
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,680
Em. OJ's coming.

1030
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:15,800
Let's go.

1031
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,760
Got to get out this house.
I got to get out this house.

1032
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,000
No, st-st-stop.
Can't we just wait, right?

1033
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,920
- You can. I've got to get out
- No, I'm not gonna be here alone.

1034
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,120
- this fucking house!
- No.

1035
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,640
We're alive still
because we stayed here.

1036
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,880
- Go.
- Go!

1037
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,760
- Come on.
- Run!

1038
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,120
Come on... come on.

1039
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,280
Go.

1040
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,960
Yeah, she... she gonna make it.

1041
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,160
- OJ.
- She gonna make it.

1042
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:01,400
- Oh, hey, horsie.
- Hey, don't look him in the eyes

1043
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:02,480
- please.
- VFX!

1044
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,920
Focus here. Focus here.

1045
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,680
Come on.

1046
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:23,960
Go!

1047
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,320
<i>Welcome to my tavern.</i>

1048
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,600
<i>I don't know if you've heard,</i>
<i>but a terrible beast is about.</i>

1049
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,320
<i>It's been harassing villagers</i>

1050
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,000
<i>ruining crops</i>
<i>and eating their livestock.</i>

1051
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:01,600
<i>Many a glory-seeking hunter</i>
<i>has attempted to defeat it</i>

1052
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:04,320
<i>and just as many have perished.</i>

1053
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,720
<i>While you're here...</i>

1054
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,000
<i>While you're here,</i>
<i>please look around.</i>

1055
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,520
I'm here in Agua Dulce, California

1056
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,120
and the whereabouts of
those 40 guests and employees

1057
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,080
<i>of a local Western theme park</i>
<i>are still unknown.</i>

1058
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,120
<i>The sheriff's office</i>
<i>has had its hands full</i>

1059
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,200
<i>trying to identify</i>
<i>the unaccounted for.</i>

1060
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,600
<i>Until they do,</i>
<i>only one thing is certain.</i>

1061
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:29,640

<i>were off at the time.</i>

1063
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,800
<i>Other than that, we have</i>
<i>no reason to suspect foul play.</i>

1064
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,280
<i>We did have a considerable amount</i>
<i>of rain come through here</i>

1065
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,640
<i>so we don't want</i>
<i>to rule out flash flooding</i>

1066
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,320
<i>as possibly having played</i>
<i>a part. We're obviously...</i>

1067
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,520
You never go wrong
with a fried fish sandwich.

1068
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,200
Tartar got tang.

1069
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,000
Stupid.

1070
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,880
"Tartar got tang"?

1071
01:23:58,960 --> 01:23:59,960
Right?

1072
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,040
I don't think it eats you
if you don't look it in the eye.

1073
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,240
Hey, hey!

1074
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:10,880
RTR, bro.

1075
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,280
You know?

1076
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,040
Like, read the room.

1077
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:23,000
Nobody want to talk about that.

1078
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,080
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

1079
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,000
All right... all right.

1080
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:29,960
Hey, you lucky!

1081
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,800
Every animal got rules.

1082
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,480
All right? We know what it wants

1083
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,240
and we know how it comes, so...

1084
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,320
Fuck.

1085
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,680
We don't really know shit.

1086
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,000
OJ, what's this about, man?

1087
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,920
What's this about? You want me to...
You want me to say, "I'm sorry"?

1088
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,800
"I was wrong"? "It's dumb"?

1089
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:49,920
It wasn't dumb.

1090
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:51,880
- Own the moment.
- Stop.

1091
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,520
- Stop, stop this shit.
- It was good. It was good.

1092
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,000
But the moment about to pass.

1093
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,760
And we don't own shit.

1094
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,400
Okay. Well, I assume
y'all are crashing at mine.

1095
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,320
Right, 'cause you can.

1096
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:10,120
'Cause I'm not going back
to the fucking monster umbrella.

1097
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,720
Got to feed 'em.

1098
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,400
Let Lucky out.

1099
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:17,920
There's shit to do.

1100
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,360
Always.

1101
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,120
Always some shit to do.

1102
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,000
There's a wheelchair on your roof.

1103
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,160
Hi.

1104
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,680
That cloud ain't moved
a goddamn inch.

1105
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,280
So you're not
completely full of shit.

1106
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,520
Thank you.

1107
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,680
Yeah. Thank you.

1108
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,920
The concept of
extraterrestrial animals in the sky

1109
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,200
is not a new thing.

1110
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,200
You know, people been trying
to get pictures of these things

1111
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,280
since, like, the '50s.

1112
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:31,720
- You know, it's an ancient...
- How do we see it?

1113
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,320
It's gonna get hungry again.

1114
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,640
So, you know...

1115
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,760
just ring the dinner bell.

1116
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,240
Now, we know what it doesn't like.

1117
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:50,800
That little fake horse and flags
messed it up good.

1118
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,120
Got stuck in its windpipe
or something.

1119
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,160
I bet it ain't gonna fuck with
flags like that in a minute.

1120
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,560
Yeah.

1121
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:01,960
We pissed him off.

1122
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,000
We're not the reason
it settled down here.

1123
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:05,800
That was Jupe.

1124
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,280
He got caught up
trying to tame a predator.

1125
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,640
You can't do that.

1126
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,320
You got to enter
an agreement with one.

1127
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,600
Yeah.

1128
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,600
Ask Siegfried and Roy.

1129
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:18,600
Okay.

1130
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,040
Asking as someone who was in
the house when the shit went down...

1131
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:28,120
How exactly do you enter
an agreement with a fucking...

1132
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:32,040
a UFO, alien entity or whatever
the hell you want to call it?

1133
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,120
Jean Jacket.

1134
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,360
Call him Jean Jacket.

1135
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,760
So, how about this?

1136
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:41,400
How about we send ol' Jean Jacket
some fresh horses in golden hour

1137
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,480
and see what happens?

1138
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,160
Horse people.

1139
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,720
Why not just set them free?

1140
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,800
We're not doing that.

1141
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Okay.

1142
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,360
Who is gonna go down there

1143
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,560
and get the star out of his trailer?

1144
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,080
Me.

1145
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,480
I'll get him out.

1146
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:07,760
Where you want it?

1147
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,640
You draw him out there.

1148
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:13,320
I'm here.

1149
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,320
On this ridge.

1150
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,640
Oh, shit.

1151
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,080
Made her myself.

1152
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,680
No electricity.

1153
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,920
Didn't I tell you this motherfucker
was gonna come up here

1154
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,760
with a non-electrical camera?

1155
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,160
Let's go, boy!

1156
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,360
Yeah!

1157
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,400
I've been up under it
a couple times now.

1158
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,400
I get him.

1159
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,400
<i>It's an animal.</i>

1160
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:39,800
<i>You don't turn your back on a bear.</i>

1161
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,520
<i>You don't wear red</i>
<i>around a bull. It's like that.</i>

1162
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,480
<i>You don't look at it</i>
<i>unless you want its attention.</i>

1163
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,680
Good night, Mr. Storeman.

1164
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,200
Fuck it. I call top hat.

1165
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,920
<i>And we ain't got a lot of time.</i>

1166
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,880
<i>One day. Two days, tops.</i>

1167
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:04,360
<i>'Cause the word is getting out,</i>
<i>and when it does...</i>

1168
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:07,560
Sorry, dead people. Park's closed.

1169
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,360
<i>You know people gonna come</i>
<i>and do what they always do:</i>

1170
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,520
<i>try and take it all for themselves.</i>

1171
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:14,680
Fine.

1172
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,920
Thimble.

1173
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,480
That's the one I wanted anyway.

1174
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,880
<i>Well, let 'em come.</i>

1175
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,560
<i>It ain't gonna matter.</i>

1176
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,880
<i>'Cause what we about to do...</i>

1177
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,320
<i>they can't erase that.</i>

1178
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,880
He's big, he's bad

1179
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,120
and he's got a lot of spirit.

1180
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,760
But anything with a spirit
can get broke.

1181
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,160
So you break it.

1182
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,160
I'll get the shot.

1183
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,800
Hey...

1184
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,560
What we're doing's important. Right?

1185
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,760
Like, what we document, it's...

1186
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,800
it's gonna do some good, huh?

1187
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,800
I mean, besides the money
and fucking fame

1188
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,880
like, we can save some lives.

1189
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,880
Fuck, we can even save Earth.

1190
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,120
Right?

1191
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:32,920
Yeah.

1192
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,120
<i>Well it came down to Earth</i>

1193
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,640
<i>And it hid in a tree</i>

1194
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:50,000
<i>I said, "Mr. Purple People Eater,</i>
<i>don't eat me"</i>

1195
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,600
<i>Well he looked at me</i>
<i>and in a voice so gruff</i>

1196
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:01,680
<i>He said, "I wouldn't eat you</i>
<i>'cause you're too tough"</i>

1197
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:14,760
<i>He was a one-eyed, one-horned,</i>
<i>flyin' purple people eater</i>

1198
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,600
<i>One-eyed, one-horned,</i>
<i>flyin' purple people eater</i>

1199
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:26,680
<i>One-eyed, one-horned,</i>
<i>flyin' purple people eater</i>

1200
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,320
<i>Sure looks strange to me.</i>

1201
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,360
He ain't gonna fuck with you.

1202
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,280
Time to wake up the family.

1203
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:47,760
Here we go.

1204
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,560
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

1205
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:20,400
How exquisitely stupid is that?

1206
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,400
We gonna get you today, motherfucker.

1207
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,640
Where is the feed for Holst's camera?

1208
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:21,720
<i>Over.</i>

1209
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:23,600
Couldn't figure it out. Over.

1210
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:26,280
<i>What you mean,</i>
<i>you couldn't figure it out? Over.</i>

1211
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,960
<i>Holst is shooting on a film camera</i>

1212
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,880
<i>and all of our cameras are digital,</i>
<i>so it's a whole thing. Over.</i>

1213
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,880
<i>Basically, you forgot about it. Over.</i>

1214
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,120
<i>Yeah, well, I had my hands full</i>

1215
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,440
<i>rigging 50 fucking sky dancers</i>
<i>to dead people's car batteries</i>

1216
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,600
<i>all connected to one control panel.</i>

1217
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:43,720
<i>So, yeah, fucking over.</i>

1218
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:45,400
<i>Sorry. I'm scared.</i>

1219
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:46,960
Man down.

1220
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:49,320
Man down? What? Where?

1221
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,280
<i>Last dancer, deep in the gulch.</i>

1222
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,200
Stay on it, Em. I'm staying up.

1223
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,200
Motherfucker.

1224
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:08,640
Oh, wait, wait.

1225
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,200
Oh, it's back up.

1226
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,240
Could be a faulty battery.

1227
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,760
<i>All right. Shot's up, then.</i>

1228
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:19,800
Nah, he's poking.

1229
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,200
Who's this asshole?

1230
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,120
Man in black on a white motorcycle.

1231
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:37,760
No... no. Shit.

1232
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,360
Can I help you?

1233
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,120
You see that cloud?

1234
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,000
Hey, man, who you with?

1235

Oh, I'm sorry.

1236

Who are you?

1237
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,240
Nobody.

1238
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:05,520
You don't look like a nobody to me.

1239
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:09,400
Yeah, look, we doing a camera test
for a Verizon commercial

1240
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,160
so now I'm-a need you
to clear the road.

1241
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,880
This whole valley comes up
as blurry on Google Maps.

1242
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,600
You're really tucked away back here.

1243
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:19,360
Jupiter's Claim?

1244
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:21,920
Quicker if you go
the other way around.

1245
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,400
Yeah.

1246
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:25,520
Actually

what did happen with Jupe Park
and all those people?

1248
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,240
He was basically
your neighbor, right?

1249
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,840
So, what, they vanished?

1250
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,880
You don't believe
the flood narrative, do you?

1251
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,000
Fuck, guys.

Don't you want to be on TV?

1258
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,800
Man, I'm trying to tell you.

1259
