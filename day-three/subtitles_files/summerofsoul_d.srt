1
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,997
All right, let me know
when you're rolling.

2
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,542
Give me a second,
I wanna get make up to...

3
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,168
Okay.

4
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,712
Is that the lowest you can go?

5
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,339
Turn it off.

6
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,132
-Level?
-Turn it down.

7
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,384
The sync went out a little bit.

8
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,804
All right. All right,
let me try that again.

9
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,557
I hope this will be worth it.

10
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,850
-It's about Harlem.
-Okay.

11
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,226
When'd you get to Harlem?

12
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,477
-Let me do, like, a room tone.
-Yeah.

13
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,603
All right.

14
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,729
Yeah, cool.

15
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,647
-Tell 'em the story like we rehearsed.
-Yep.

16
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,066
You guys ready?

17
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,276
-Sound speed?
-Sound speeding.

18
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,278
Camera speed.

19
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,823
Well, first of all, thank you
for doing this interview for us.

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,993
We're gonna bring in the monitor
to show you some footage.

21
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:24,585
So, do you remember
the Harlem Cultural Festival?

22
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,129
That summer of 1969?

23
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,266
There is a lost wallet.

24
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,687
Anne Reynolds. Anne Reynolds.

25
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,064
Your wallet is over here.

26
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,444
Nobody ever heard
of the Harlem Cultural Festival.

27
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,946
Nobody would believe it happened.

28
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:57,409
The organist is on number 15,
he'll play a little bit for you now.

29
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:03,081
All I remember is going to
this amazing concert in the park.

30
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,919
You gotta move back, ladies and gentlemen.
You gotta move back.

31
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,215
And there was just a sea of Black people.

32
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,678
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
Hold it. Hold it.

33
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,056
That is the organ mic, sir.

34
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,517
As soon as you move down, we can start.

35
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:16,363
Welcome to the Harlem Cultural Festival
here in Mount Morris Park,

36
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,990
in the heart of Harlem.

37
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:26,498
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the young brother of soul...

38
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:31,670
Stevie Wonder!

39
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,757
Hey, y'all, it's raining.

40
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,552
Here we go

41
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,058
Here we go again

42
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,980
We gotta get a groove goin'

43
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,736
Gotta get a groove goin'
Baby, love

44
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,909
All you got to do, baby, yeah

45
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:07,289
Is do what Stevie tell you to do

46
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,792
Oh, yeah

47
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:16,507
Everybody, clap your hands

48
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,928
Let me hear
Clap your hands

49
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,721
'Cause

50
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:28,101
It's your thing, do what you wanna do

51
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:33,482
Don't let me tell you good things love do

52
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,402
Just as long, just as long

53
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,698
Just as long as you give it to me

54
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,297
The Harlem Cultural Festival
was a total party atmosphere.

55
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:48,891
Well, it was in Mount Morris Park,
where the Panthers were the security...

56
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,351
and the kids were sittin' up on the trees.

57
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:04,156
1969 was a change of era
in the Black community.

58
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,951
The wholesale reevaluation
of our history and our culture.

59
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,832
The styles were changing.

60
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,667
Music was changing.

61
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,669
And revolution was coming together.

62
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,631
We want Black power!

63
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:21,882
We need it now.

64
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,300
The revolution is not gonna stop.

65
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,468
In 1969.

66
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,178
We want a new life.

67
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,807
A Black consciousness revolution.

68
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,435
It was the right time, the right place.

69
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,811
We were there.

70
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,899
Yeah, yeah, yeah

71
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,235
We wanted freedom now.

72
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,861
What time is it?

73
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:52,120
We were creating a new world.

74
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,125
SUMMER OF SOUL

75
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:02,631
(...OR, WHEN THE REVOLUTION
COULD NOT BE TELEVISED)

76
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,306
We were looking forward to that festival
for some time.

77
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:16,520
I was 19 in 1969. Going to college.

78
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:20,524
That's the summer we became free.
Of our parents.

79
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,990
I lived in Harlem.
On Madison and 135th.

80
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:32,119
That festival was so close to home.
It was only 10 blocks away.

81
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,581
My three best friends and I,
we could actually walk.

82
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:42,171
We got there early.
Boy, it was hot that day.

83
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:46,216
And the sun was in my face.
And it was exciting.

84
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,137
We hadn't had anything like that
in Harlem, that I can recall.

85
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:55,058
Welcome to the heart of Harlem,
Soulsville USA.

86
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,853
This is Tony Lawrence...

87
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,190
and 50,000 beautiful people here
in Mount Morris Park.

88
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,194
And we are asking you to join us
in the Soul Music Festival.

89
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:12,659
Now from Mississippi, ladies
and gentlemen, The Chambers Brothers.

90
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:19,458
Hey! Do it to it

91
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,005
Sock it, sock it to me, hey

92
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,383
You like it like that, yeah

93
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,678
That's where it's at, yeah
Hey

94
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,015
Do it to it
I'm going uptown to Harlem

95
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,186
To let my hair down in Harlem

96
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,856
If a taxi won't take me
I'll catch a train

97
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,984
I'll go underground
I'll get there just the same

98
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,569
Because I'm goin'

99
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,488
Uptown to Harlem

100
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,656
Gonna let my hair

101
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,033
Down in Harlem

102
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,119
125th Street
Now here I come

103
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,581
Get ready for me 'cause I'm coming for fun

104
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:03,377
I'm gonna eat me some-a-chicken
some black-eyed peas

105
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,422
Barbequed ribs and some collard greens
I'm gonna party for

106
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,591
Days in Harlem

107
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:10,843
Leave the downtown

108
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,928
Ways for Harlem

109
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,431
'Cause I'm going uptown to Harlem

110
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,892
Harlem was heaven to us.

111
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,605
It was a place where I was safe, happy,
and made lifelong friends.

112
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,525
I'll go underground
I'll get there just the same

113
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:27,985
I'm gonna make it to the Cave

114
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,446
Of course, you had those destitute areas
you might consider a ghetto.

115
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,032
Harlem, where
the tight-packed tenements...

116
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,287
spew forth the overcrowded thousands
onto the overheated streets.

117
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,957
But to us Harlemers, Camelot.

118
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:46,044
It is a creative forest where you
are honed by the hardships of experience.

119
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,589
And many a creative gem comes forth.

120
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,174
Down to Harlem

121
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,050
We loved the culture.

122
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:55,554
The people, the parties,
the food, the nightclubs.

123
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,556
It was just so rich.

124
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,309
I'll go underground
I'll get there just the same

125
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,896
Harlem was the place to be,
that's where it all happened.

126
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,231
I just graduated from high school.

127
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,818
We wanted to see concerts, dance,
just have fun.

128
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,446
The normal thing
that a high school girl would do.

129
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:16,909
When I heard about this concert,
it was like, "Okay, let's go."

130
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,661
-We got to, got to, got to
-Down to Harlem

131
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,955
-Yeah, you got to go up to Harlem
-I'm going uptown

132
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,583
I was 19 in 1969.

133
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:30,214
The festival had the biggest crowds
I can remember seeing at the time.

134
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:34,426
I was home from college,
it was a hot summer.

135
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:38,931
I always related summertime
to the potential of violence.

136
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:42,434
And there was quite a bit of anxiety
that year.

137
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,810
1969.

138
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,772
Black America has lost faith
in this country.

139
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:50,150
Many of us have seen too many
of our leaders jailed and killed.

140
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,194
We have JFK in '63.

141
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,946
A bulletin from CBS News.

142
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,822
President Kennedy is dead.

143
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,408
His assassination was the result
of the climate of hate.

144
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,452
We've got Malcolm in '65.

145
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:05,165
The assassination of Malcolm X
was an unfortunate tragedy.

146
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,293
'68 in April,
you've got Martin Luther King.

147
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,380
Martin Luther King was shot
and was killed tonight.

148
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,883
June '68, you've got Robert Kennedy.

149
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,385
Is there a doctor...

150
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,972
After that, it felt like the system
was letting you down.

151
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,474
President Nixon is now occupying
the White House.

152
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,601
We are not gonna have
a lot of guilt-stricken

153
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,645
white liberals hanging around to turn on.

154
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,773
We're gonna be dealing now
with white America at its worst.

155
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,609
There was protests and a lot of unrest.

156
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,570
Then there was the Vietnam War.

157
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,906
There is a disproportionate representation
of Black men on the frontlines of Vietnam.

158
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:42,619
We were hearing about these deaths.
So many people our very age.

159
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:46,206
A family member, a father,
an uncle, a cousin.

160
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,084
There is no need to go to Vietnam...

161
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,379
and shoot somebody who a honky says
is your enemy.

162
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,007
We gonna shoot the cops who are shootin'
our Black brothers...

163
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,717
in the back in this country.

164
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,343
That's where we're goin' to fight.

165
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,680
By '69, the Black community was divided...

166
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,016
between those that were advocating
non-violence...

167
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,686
I'd rather quit talking about revolution
and talk about what is possible.

168
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,397
I was with the non-violent crowd
'cause I was a boy preacher

169
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,481
even though I was 14.

170
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:17,070
But most of my friends was with those that
were saying self-defense and/or worse.

171
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,699
And if that means tearin' up the community
to gain our freedom, we will.

172
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:23,619
'68.

173
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,371
A day after the death of
Doctor Martin Luther King...

174
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,916
in more than 100 cities,
violence broke out.

175
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,377
Several thousand looters sacked
Harlem streets for nearly seven hours...

176
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,922
the worst outbreak of looting
in that area's history.

177
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:39,885
I knew New York was trying not to have
a repeat of that in '69.

178
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:44,139
People were afraid of the anger and rage
boiling over.

179
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:47,476
It's too late now, we are ready to start,
and we're gonna finish it up.

180
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:52,022
Yeah, yeah
Come on and get me

181
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,191
Uptown to Harlem

182
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,109
Gonna let my hair down

183
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,278
So, the goal of the festival...

184
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,281
may very well have been
to keep Black folks

185
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:04,201
from burnin' up the city in '69.

186
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,911
Yeah

187
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:19,758
It was a crazy, crazy, crazy period.

188
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,679
We needed something to really reach out
and touch us.

189
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,097
We needed that music.

190
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,765
Brothers and sisters...

191
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:30,435
now we bring you
the world's greatest blues singer.

192
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:33,355
Ladies and gentlemen, B.B. King.

193
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,963
Yes, everybody wanna know

194
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,425
Why I sing the blues

195
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,845
I say, everybody wanna know

196
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:08,432
Why I sing the blues

197
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,894
You know, I've been around a long time

198
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,689
People, I've really paid my dues

199
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,109
I first got the blues
They brought me over on a ship

200
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:23,822
There was men standing over me
And a lot more with a whip

201
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,658
And everybody wanna know

202
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:30,120
Everybody wanna know why
I'm singin' the blues

203
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,664
I've been around a long time

204
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:36,460
People, I've really paid my dues

205
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:39,796
I've laid in the ghetto flats
Cold and numb

206
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:44,384
I heard the rats tell the bedbugs
To give the roaches some

207
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,554
Everybody wanna know

208
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,933
Everybody wanna know
Why I'm singin' the blues

209
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,227
Been around a long time

210
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,939
People, I've really paid my dues

211
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,658
Big hand for B.B. King!

212
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,288
If you will, brothers and sisters,
let's give him his due.

213
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,667
The producer and director of the
Harlem Cultural Festival of 1969,

214
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,753
Tony Lawrence.
Tony Lawrence, let's give it to him.

215
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,515
I'll tell you what we're gonna do...

216
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,267
we're gonna get it right
and do a little thing.

217
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:18,896
I want all of you to do it with me,
all right? Gotta get comfortable here.

218
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,732
All right. Gonna throw this away.

219
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,068
Hey, now, come on.
Take the music down a little bit, baby.

220
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,864
Take it down just a little bit,
'cause I know you feel good.

221
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:32,701
I was introduced to Tony Lawrence,
when the Parks Department was tasked...

222
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:38,415
with supporting this guy,
Tony Lawrence's initiative

223
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,460
to hold something called
the Harlem Cultural Festival.

224
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,670
And I was Tony's assistant.

225
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:47,841
He was an ebullient guy,
he had this phenomenal smile.

226
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:51,887
I remember Tony being physically
always on the move.

227
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:56,099
Being very positive,
never getting angry about things,

228
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,226
but never sitting still.

229
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,437
He was a lounge singer,
and he was a promoter.

230
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,648
Can you hear me in the back?
How we doin' over there? All right?

231
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,066
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

232
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,609
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen...

233
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:07,819
From right here in Harlem...

234
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,195
Soul time!

235
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,252
Tony was a hustler in the best sense.

236
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,088
He would make a promise
about delivering something...

237
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,674
and then leverage that...

238
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,260
to be able to get other people
to wanna participate.

239
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,429
It's all premised on half commitments...

240
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:37,516
that are dependent on another,
and it all...

241
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,102
ultimately, if you're persistent,
you pull it all together.

242
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,479
He knew
how to schmooze with politicians...

243
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:46,483
and he knew how to talk to
entertainers and musicians.

244
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:52,197
Tony talked a big game, and he delivered.
The '69 festival was huge.

245
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:00,330
The challenges of staging
something like that are enormous.

246
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,165
To build a good stage...

247
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,293
to have a decent sound system...

248
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,046
that can cover 30 or 40,000 people
in the park...

249
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:12,301
you've got six consecutive weekends
of major artists.

250
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:17,556
But in that era, artists and particularly
artist managers and booking agents...

251
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:21,518
none of them were the least bit interested
in these kinds of events.

252
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,563
They were risky because they were afraid
they wouldn't get paid...

253
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,273
because who's Tony Lawrence?

254
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,651
I would think the biggest challenge
was convincing them...

255
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,946
that this is A, legit,
B, it's secure, you'll get paid.

256
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:37,367
Yes, the city is really doing it.
Yes, there'll be security. You'll be safe.

257
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,911
It was our understanding...

258
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:43,415
that the police was not gonna do security
for the Harlem Cultural Festival.

259
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:47,211
So, the Black Panthers were there on point
to be doing security.

260
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,715
My job was to make sure
that the backstage was covered.

261
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,134
We had some members
dressed in regular clothing...

262
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,470
and some members in uniform.

263
00:18:56,637 --> 00:19:01,225
Eventually, the police, they were there,
but we wasn't gonna take any chances.

264
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:06,271
Really, the biggest challenge was just
having enough cash to do it right.

265
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:09,274
But not only did Tony
get the city behind it...

266
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,151
Maxwell House put up a bunch of money.

267
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,611
The Harlem Cultural Festival...

268
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:15,280
is being brought to you
by Maxwell Household coffee.

269
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,367
Man found it first
in the humid highlands of Kenya...

270
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:23,163
and in the misty plateaus of Abyssinia,
a little brown bean.

271
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:27,584
And at the heart of Instant Maxwell House,
is the little brown bean...

272
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:33,257
from the rich, moist soil
on the misty slopes of Africa.

273
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,677
General Foods called me up
to do a television special.

274
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:42,641
We knew we cannot let this enormous array
of talent not be taped.

275
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,393
We must record them.

276
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,479
There was no budget, no money, no lights.

277
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:53,402
So, the stage had to face west
because I had to use the sun.

278
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,696
This was a high-visibility undertaking...

279
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:58,782
and would be an embarrassment
if it didn't work.

280
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:07,583
Yeah, so Tony had to have had somebody
who vouched for him.

281
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:13,130
At this time, we would like to introduce
a young man...

282
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:18,051
who is leading one of the greatest fights
in the world for our people.

283
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,930
Ladies and gentlemen,
our blue-eyed soul brother...

284
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:25,475
the mayor of New York City,
Mayor John V. Lindsay.

285
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,102
Let's hear it!

286
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,315
That somebody was John Lindsay.

287
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:34,943
John Lindsay was the Republican mayor
in New York...

288
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,737
but a liberal Republican.

289
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,906
Tall, lanky, charismatic.

290
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,158
He was popular among Blacks.

291
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:46,371
He seemed to not be in any way
uncomfortable around Black people.

292
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:59,092
Lindsay would go
to the Black community frequently...

293
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,970
and advocate anti-poverty programs.

294
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:05,307
He made it possible for us 16-year-olds
to get our first jobs.

295
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,142
He just was so chill.

296
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,645
Lindsay was a hellified mayor.

297
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,439
When we had the riots
when they killed King,

298
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,733
he was there in it
right out in the street.

299
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,445
The community of Harlem wants to be safe.

300
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,697
They want to be able to walk tall
down the street.

301
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:28,288
In '69, Lindsay ran for re-election.

302
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:32,209
You're a bum, Lindsay!
I'll say it to your face.

303
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:36,129
He energized the Blacks and
the Puerto Ricans and some of the Jews.

304
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:40,968
I simply wanted to express my appreciation
to the Harlem community

305
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,219
for this glorious festival.

306
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:46,765
This great concert could not possibly be
and would not be...

307
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:51,144
without the inspiration and the support
and the energy of this great community...

308
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,980
of our city of New York.

309
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,109
We're not gonna let him get off.

310
00:21:57,276 --> 00:22:00,946
You know, the mayor was gonna sing...

311
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:03,699
He's Got the Whole World in His Hands
with me...

312
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,368
and he's comin' back next weekend...

313
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:09,246
and I think him and I are gonna do
Knock On Wood together.

314
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,414
How's that, huh?

315
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:13,166
All right, we're gonna truly make him
a soul brother, okay?

316
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,424
I was a little kid.

317
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:26,346
I remember being with my family
walking around the park.

318
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,143
And as far as I could see,
it was just Black people.

319
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:36,690
This was the first time I'd ever seen
so many of us.

320
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,776
It was incredible.

321
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:46,575
Families, fathers, mothers,
kids running around.

322
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:48,827
I was one of those kids.

323
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:53,832
Beautiful, beautiful women,
beautiful men.

324
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,377
It was like seeing royalty.

325
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,798
Around the park,
people were selling food.

326
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,342
Mom was cookin'.

327
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:06,720
She had her grill, chicken,
mac 'n' cheese...

328
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:11,725
maybe some greens, lemonade,
Kool-Aid, sellin' beer...

329
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:14,937
sellin' headbands,
sweatbands and balloons.

330
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,314
I remember that distinctly.

331
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,944
It smelled like Afro Sheen and chicken.

332
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,321
Growing up in Harlem,
if you went to places like that...

333
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:25,572
even went to the movies...

334
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:30,994
Mom fried some chicken, she'd put it
in foil and you took it with you.

335
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,622
We brought everything to the park.

336
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:37,042
You know, the blankets,
the Vaseline for the knees.

337
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:40,212
It was the ultimate Black barbecue.

338
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:44,174
And then you start to hear music...

339
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:46,301
and someone speaking...

340
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:50,055
And now, for the first time in Harlem,
Soulsville, USA...

341
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,473
...and you knew it was something bigger.

342
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,562
...ladies and gentlemen,
the 5th Dimension!

343
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:59,940
Don't cha hear me callin' to ya

344
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:03,277
Don't cha hear me callin' to ya, baby

345
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:09,116
Don't cha hear me callin' to ya
Don't cha hear me callin' to ya, baby

346
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:13,495
-I miss you, baby, and I want you back
-Don't cha hear me callin' to ya

347
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:15,831
Don't cha hear me callin' to ya

348
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:19,084
-I guess I'm crazy
-Don't cha hear me callin' to ya

349
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:22,588
-But I want you back
-Don't cha hear me callin' to ya

350
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:24,173
I told you, leave me

351
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,717
I remember watching the 5th Dimension.

352
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:29,136
Don't cha hear me callin' to ya

353
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:30,554
I'm cryin', baby

354
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,265
Their outfits were orange...

355
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:36,351
but it was an orange, like, you know,
remember the Creamsicles?

356
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,979
-I need ya, baby
-Don't cha hear me callin' to ya

357
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:40,731
I'm going mad

358
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:42,774
I thought they were a little extreme.

359
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:45,819
-You know I love you
-Don't cha hear me callin' to ya

360
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:49,114
-You know I care
-Don't cha hear me callin' to ya

361
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:50,490
Can't you see I'm lonely

362
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,910
I remember looking at Marilyn McCoo.

363
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,829
Don't cha hear me callin' to ya

364
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:02,336
She was so beautiful
that I was just, like, transfixed.

365
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,796
I thought she was the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen in my life.

366
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,799
God, she's my first crush.
I mean, I guess.

367
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:14,806
We were so excited about performing
in Harlem.

368
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:15,974
Callin' ya baby

369
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,726
It was the first time.

370
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:18,977
Come on home

371
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,145
When we first hit...

372
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:23,565
we came out of the box
right into the pop charts.

373
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:27,986
We were a group that just came together
as friends from St. Louis, Missouri.

374
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,864
We wanted to sing R and B, pop.

375
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,158
We wanted to have a jazz influence in it.

376
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,458
But everybody thought we were a white act.

377
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:42,626
Thank you.

378
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:44,336
Until they saw a picture of the group...

379
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,464
and then they saw these Black folks

380
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:50,342
in this balloon,
they said, "Wait a minute...

381
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:52,761
"That's not what we expected," you know...

382
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:55,180
but yet and still, here we come, you know?

383
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,560
Back then, music was segregated.

384
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,311
Pop groups weren't playing Black music...

385
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:03,981
and Black groups
weren't playin' pop music.

386
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,650
And so, we were caught in the middle.

387
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:15,492
When the moon is in the Seventh House

388
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:20,831
And Jupiter aligns with Mars

389
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:25,878
Then peace will guide the planets

390
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:29,047
And love will steer the stars

391
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:33,927
This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius

392
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:38,682
Age of Aquarius

393
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:43,270
Aquarius

394
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:47,649
Aquarius

395
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:51,528
Harmony and understanding

396
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,156
Sympathy and trust abounding

397
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:56,033
No more falsehoods or derisions

398
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,660
Golden living dreams of visions

399
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,246
Mystic crystal revelation

400
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:04,374
And the mind's true liberation

401
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:09,087
Aquarius

402
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:12,591
Aquarius

403
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:23,769
-When the moon is in the Seventh House
-When the moon

404
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:27,606
Boy, to hear that song,
it brings back a lot of memories.

405
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:31,568
When we first heard that song,
in the production of Hair...

406
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,947
we were workin' at the Americana
in New York.

407
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,407
Hair was the biggest thing going.

408
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,368
People were standing around the corners...

409
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:41,745
they were waitin' in lines,
tryin' to get in...

410
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:46,583
because it's the first time
they ever seen anybody get naked on stage.

411
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,546
And we'd been tryin' to see that show
for months.

412
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,257
Then one day, I lost my wallet in a cab.

413
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:57,928
A gentleman gets in behind and
finds my wallet, calls me at the hotel.

414
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:00,305
I went over to get it,
I offered him some money.

415
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:01,682
He didn't want no money.

416
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:06,144
So I said, "Okay, I'll invite you over
to the Americana to see our show."

417
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:08,981
After the show,
we went backstage and he said...

418
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:12,192
"Since you were so nice,
I'd like to invite you to see our show."

419
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,070
I said, "What, then?
What show have you got?"

420
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:19,992
You know, he said
he was one of the producers of Hair.

421
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:21,827
Can you believe that?

422
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:26,206
And we got in that day
and we heard Aquarius.

423
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,333
Blew us out of our chairs.

424
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,627
During the intermission,
we got together and said...

425
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,797
"We have to record that song.
It's a hit, it's a hit."

426
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,008
So we called Bones Howe, our producer...

427
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:39,678
and he said, "I've got an idea.
We'll take Aquarius...

428
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:43,098
"and we'll put it together
with Let The Sunshine In."

429
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:47,895
Aquarius

430
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,691
That was the biggest record of 1969.

431
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:02,201
Let the sunshine

432
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:05,370
Let the sunshine in

433
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:09,583
The sunshine in

434
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,753
Let the sunshine

435
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,465
-Let it shine, come on
-Let the sunshine in

436
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:19,343
The sunshine in

437
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:23,138
-Sing along
-Let the sunshine

438
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:26,517
-Let it shine
-Let the sunshine in

439
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:29,645
-Open up your heart
-The sunshine in

440
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:33,315
-When you feel like you've been mistreated
-Let the sunshine

441
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:37,361
Billy laid all those wonderful
gospel licks in his ad libs.

442
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:40,614
Our producer said,
"Okay, Billy, take it to church."

443
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:43,408
-Yeah.
-And Billy knew exactly what to do...

444
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:45,619
because Billy sang gospel
in his teen years.

445
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:49,748
You know, the 5th Dimension,
we travel all over the world...

446
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:52,918
and our main purpose for travelin'...

447
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:56,713
is just to bring and spread a little love.

448
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,925
Ain't nothing wrong with that, is there?
Talk to me!

449
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,094
We were constantly being attacked...

450
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:04,346
because we weren't quote-unquote
"Black enough."

451
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:08,308
Sometimes we were called
"the Black group with the white sound."

452
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:09,810
We didn't like that.

453
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,812
We happened to be artists who are Black...

454
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:15,107
and our voices sound the way they sound.
And how do you color...

455
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:16,483
That used to be one of our questions.

456
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,652
How do you color a sound?

457
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:24,658
That was one of the reasons why performing
in Harlem was so important to us...

458
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:29,496
because we wanted our people to know
what we were about.

459
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:32,499
And we were hoping
that they would receive us.

460
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,960
Come on and let

461
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:39,256
Let it shine

462
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,970
Hey! Come on and let

463
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,892
-We were so happy to be there.
-Yeah.

464
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,532
I didn't want to leave.
I didn't want to leave her.

465
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:07,492
Let's just be clear.

466
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:16,543
After the show, these kids came backstage,
and it was so unexpected.

467
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,378
It was my cousins.

468
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:22,049
It was Ruth, Sheryl, and Maurice.

469
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,635
And I'm saying to them,
"What are you guys doin' here?"

470
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:29,306
And they said, "Well, we're singin'
with the Edwin Hawkins Singers."

471
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:32,309
-Which was on the festival that year.
-That day.

472
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:34,436
And Edwin Hawkins was hot, you know.

473
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:37,481
-Oh Happy Day.
-Oh Happy Day. Everybody was singin' that.

474
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,318
Oh happy day

475
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:46,865
-Oh happy day
-Oh happy day

476
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:51,537
-When Jesus washed
-When Jesus washed

477
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:54,831
-When he washed
-When Jesus washed

478
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:57,626
-When Jesus washed
-When Jesus washed

479
00:31:57,793 --> 00:32:02,005
-He washed all my sins away
-Oh happy day

480
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:05,008
-Oh that's a happy day
-Oh happy day

481
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:07,427
He taught me how

482
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:09,888
He taught me how, yeah

483
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:14,226
-To watch, fight, and pray
-Oh, oh, yeah

484
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:17,020
I know, good God, oh, yes

485
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:18,981
Fight and pray

486
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:24,945
-Oh happy day, ooh, yeah
-Oh happy day

487
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:28,448
-Oh happy day
-Oh happy day

488
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:31,869
-Oh a happy day
-Oh happy day

489
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:35,372
-Can I get to heaven, my Lord?
-Oh happy day

490
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:39,334
-I'm gonna spread the news, yeah
-Oh happy day

491
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,503
People tell me that the streets

492
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:42,963
It's amazing.

493
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,424
-Streets are paved with gold, yeah
-Oh happy day

494
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:50,470
Looking at all the people on the stage.
My first reaction was, "My God."

495
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,806
They tell me
you got that in heaven, my Lord

496
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,974
Oh happy day

497
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:55,350
They tell me
you got that in heaven, my Lord

498
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:58,020
The Edwin Hawkins Singers
were from all over the Bay Area.

499
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:00,898
San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley area.

500
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,317
Edwin was minister of music
at our church...

501
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,235
the Ephesian Church of God in Christ.

502
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,821
Walter Hawkins is Edwin's baby brother.

503
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:11,909
Both of those guys, very consecrated
young men. They loved the Lord.

504
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:15,829
Edwin would put our choir on a fast.
We would fast and pray.

505
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:20,167
-I'm gonna spread the news, yeah
-Oh happy day

506
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:22,211
-I'm gonna walk around, my Lord
-Oh happy day

507
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:26,215
When Oh Happy Day was recorded,
San Francisco DJs heard the song...

508
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,842
and put it on rotation
until it made it number one.

509
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,261
The Ed Hawkins Singers from KDIA...

510
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:35,182
held on to the number-one spot
for four consecutive weeks.

511
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:39,937
Ed, what effect has all this sudden fame
and fortune had on the choir and yourself?

512
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,315
It's a lot of excitement going on
and I'm very happy about it.

513
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,192
We started ministering in clubs...

514
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,152
and ministering with secular artists
on stages like Harlem.

515
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,780
-Happy day
-Oh happy day

516
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:53,825
-When Jesus washed
-When Jesus washed

517
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:57,538
-I'm so glad that he washed
-When Jesus washed

518
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:00,207
-I said the Lord washed
-When Jesus washed

519
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:02,709
He washed all my sins away

520
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:06,630
But when Oh Happy Day broke,
the church was upset about it.

521
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:08,674
We were part of the Pentecostal movement.

522
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:10,884
You didn't drink. You didn't dance.

523
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:14,137
You didn't go to clubs,
so we were persecuted.

524
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,556
It was very humiliating.

525
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:19,560
But we felt like the world needed
Oh Happy Day.

526
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,687
With the situation of the world today...

527
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:23,647
a lot of people don't believe
in God anymore.

528
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:25,983
They don't go to church.
Especially our youth.

529
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:27,609
It's really messed up, confused...

530
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,194
they don't know who to turn to,
which way to go...

531
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,072
so they're trying this and that
and they're not finding satisfaction.

532
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,242
And I feel with young people
such as our group...

533
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:38,161
instead of us trying to take the gospel
to them by preaching to them...

534
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:41,331
take it to them in song, maybe,
with contemporary sounds...

535
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:44,001
new beats, new rhythms,
something they can understand...

536
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:47,170
something they can feel
and express themselves in.

537
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,214
We can show them that God yet lives.

538
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,177
-Please, oh, Lord take me for your city
-Oh happy day

539
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:56,722
-And then you fill me
-Oh happy day

540
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,600
-Oh, yeah!
-Oh happy day

541
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:04,980
-Oh, yes it was
-Oh happy day

542
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:16,825
Welcome to the gospel music day.

543
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:20,329
Gospel folks from all over the country
are here today...

544
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:21,872
to spread the spirit.

545
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:25,584
So, come on in here. Get close to me
so we can feel the spirit.

546
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:29,213
All right? All right? Okay.

547
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:32,132
All right, that's enough, that's enough.
All right, that's enough.

548
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,302
Let's calm it down now.
Look, let's take it down a little bit.

549
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:39,515
Direct from Chicago
to the heart of Harlem...

550
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:43,310
Papa Staple and the Staple Singers.

551
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:48,315
Sittin' around on a mourner's bench

552
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:51,318
I heard an old lady and an amen
Come again to pray

553
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,445
And she began to moan

554
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:00,577
Yeah, yeah, yeah

555
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:03,247
Oh, yes, sir

556
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:06,625
Then I went ahead and asked her
She was Emma Sue

557
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,961
Emma Sue

558
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,175
I've got to move

559
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:29,982
Oh, get out here

560
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:34,903
Oh, hear me sing, Lord
No, I can't help myself

561
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,197
-But you, Lord above
-Yeah

562
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:39,283
-Help me, Lord Jesus
-Yeah

563
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:41,577
-Give me more faith
-Yeah

564
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:43,620
-I need your power
-Yeah

565
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:46,039
Help me to run this race

566
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:48,250
Help me, Jesus
Help me, Jesus

567
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,127
Help me, Jesus
Help me, Lord

568
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:55,174
When I looked out into the crowd,
I was overtaken with joy.

569
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:57,801
Help me, Jesus
Help me, Jesus

570
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:02,181
I just saw so many Black people,
and they were rejoicing.

571
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:06,685
They were havin' a good time,
and I started celebratin' with them.

572
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,854
-When Jesus helped me
-Well, well

573
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,981
-When Jesus helped me
-Give us time to get some

574
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:13,108
-When Jesus helped me
-We forgive all day

575
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:16,111
-When Jesus helped me
-Believe

576
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:19,531
In 1969, we were singin' gospel...

577
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:24,703
but we would be invited to folk festivals,
jazz festivals, blues...

578
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,288
I told Pops, I said...

579
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:28,916
"Daddy, why these people invitin' us
to blues festivals...

580
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,418
"but we don't sing no blues?"

581
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:34,213
He said, "Mavis, listen to our music.

582
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:37,758
"You will hear every kind of music
in our songs."

583
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:42,262
Whoa, we are going to Heaven
Just say amen

584
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:46,475
Just say amen
Just say amen

585
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:48,268
Just say amen
Let me hear you sing it now

586
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:51,813
In fact, it was years
before my sisters and I...

587
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,858
knew Pops was playin' the blues
on his guitar...

588
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:58,362
while we were singin' gospel.

589
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:01,198
We said,
"Daddy, you're playin' the blues."

590
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:03,534
He said, "That's the way I learned."

591
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,370
Yeah, don't you need him now?
Yeah

592
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:09,081
Pops was born in Mississippi.

593
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:13,669
He came out of school in the eighth grade,
started working at Dockery's farm.

594
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:17,631
He didn't know music,
but he taught himself to play guitar.

595
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:20,342
The first guitar I bought,
I paid five dollars for it.

596
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:21,802
-Five dollars.
-Five dollars.

597
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,846
-Where did you get the five dollars?
-Picking cotton plants.

598
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:26,306
Were you?
And how much did you make about a day?

599
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:29,393
-I made three dollars a week.
-Three dollars a week?

600
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,857
50 cents a day, 14 hours a day.
It wasn't easy. It was tough.

601
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:36,358
-Over here
-Amen

602
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:38,318
-Help you, yeah
-Amen

603
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,404
-Clap your hands over here
-Amen

604
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,406
Let me hear you clap your hands

605
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:44,032
Well, now do you feel all right now?

606
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,412
When we first started singin',
people thought we were old people...

607
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:50,414
'cause we were singin' these old songs...

608
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:53,750
that Pops and his family
used to sing in Mississippi.

609
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,294
-Do you feel all right?
-Amen

610
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,461
Do you feel all right?

611
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:59,756
There's something very specific about
what happened in Black America...

612
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:03,427
where I think the only place
we could be fully expressive

613
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,929
was in music, was in these church rituals.

614
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,514
Help me, Lord

615
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:10,726
Gospel was channeling the emotional core
of Black people...

616
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:12,728
who were insiders as Christian.

617
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:15,355
They experienced and redefined it
for themselves...

618
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:16,773
and that goes all the way back...

619
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,736
to the first moments, probably,
of Black conversion to Christianity.

620
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,864
Come on and throw down
Sing and shout

621
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:26,575
-Nobody there to put me down
-Holler

622
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:29,203
-Look up there in the heat of the day
-Holler

623
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,247
-Filled up my heart, then began to say
-Holler

624
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,252
There's this notion of spirit possession
that comes from Africa.

625
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:43,675
It's a part of seeking
a certain kind of release and catharsis.

626
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:06,031
This is an eruption of spirit...

627
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:10,202
to arrive at an inner peace through
being completely expressively open.

628
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:17,709
Wrapped, tied
Wrapped and tangled

629
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:20,212
I am wrapped and tangled

630
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:23,090
Wrapped, tied and tangled
Wrapped, tied and tangled

631
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:26,468
Wrapped, tied and tangled
Wrapped, tied and tangled

632
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:30,055
Wrapped, tied and tangled
Wrapped, tied and tangled

633
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:31,640
-Wrapped, tied and tangled
-Are you wrapped

634
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:33,225
-Wrapped, tied and tangled
-Are you wrapped

635
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:34,810
-Wrapped, tied and tangled
-Are you wrapped

636
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,353
-Wrapped, tied and tangled
-Are you wrapped

637
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,021
-Wrapped, tied and tangled
-Are you wrapped

638
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:39,189
-Wrapped, tied and tangled
-Are you wrapped

639
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,900
-Oh, yeah, wrapped over here
-Wrapped, tied and tangled

640
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:45,153
Gospel was more than religious.

641
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:51,118
Gospel was the therapy for the stress
and pressure of being Black in America.

642
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:54,913
We didn't go to a psychiatrist,
we didn't go lay on a couch...

643
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,084
we didn't know anything about therapists,
but we knew Mahalia Jackson.

644
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:03,547
While I'm singin' I'm holy
Lord, search my heart

645
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,051
While I'm singin' I'm holy
Lord, search my heart

646
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:13,098
While I'm singin' I'm holy
Lord, search my heart

647
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:30,324
Gospel's part of our DNA.

648
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:33,827
It's deep in the recesses
of my consciousness.

649
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:37,039
My grandfather was a minister.

650
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:40,959
My father was a chaplain in World War II,
the Korean War.

651
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:45,672
That religious consciousness
kept him and so many others going.

652
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,344
During the civil rights movement,
the church provided sustenance for us...

653
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:52,304
helped us march on...

654
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:58,101
helped generations of people confront
some of the most vicious, violent acts.

655
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:02,898
They took the great Martin Luther King
from us.

656
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:07,027
They took the great John Kennedy from us.

657
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:09,696
They took the great Bobby Kennedy...

658
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:13,742
but most of all from Harlem
they took Malcolm X from us!

659
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:15,661
Now listen! Now wait a minute!

660
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:20,040
God knows a whole lot of generations
of Black folks here.

661
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:22,459
We're gonna make history right here
with the Black and the white...

662
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:26,004
and the Spanish and
the Puerto Rican people right here today.

663
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,508
We'd like to introduce
Reverend Jesse Jackson...

664
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:33,262
and Ben Branch
and Operation Breadbasket band.

665
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:37,474
Brothers and sisters here in Harlem...

666
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:41,395
I want us to prepare
to bow our heads in prayer.

667
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:48,610
It does not really matter
who your God is...

668
00:42:48,777 --> 00:42:51,655
whether you call him Allah...

669
00:42:51,822 --> 00:42:57,953
Zen Buddha, Jehovah, Elohim or Yahweh...

670
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:02,416
Ben Branch was a saxophone player
from Memphis.

671
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:06,420
When Reverend Jackson started
the Operation Breadbasket rallies...

672
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:08,422
Ben put an orchestra together.

673
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:10,966
I was youth director
of Operation Breadbasket...

674
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:15,846
and we put pressure on the private sector
to contract Black businesses...

675
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:19,016
give us shelf space,
put Blacks on corporate boards...

676
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:21,101
or we would boycott
and we would picket them.

677
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:26,857
And so today we will throw up around here
justice pickets.

678
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:33,071
Ben Branch was always revered
by the kids like me...

679
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:37,659
because Doctor King's
last words was to Ben.

680
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:45,334
We want sister Mahalia, Mavis Staples...

681
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:49,880
and all of our groups together
to prepare to do, as our prayer today...

682
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:51,882
Precious Lord.

683
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:57,304
Precious Lord, Take My Hand

684
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:00,807
was Doctor King's favorite song...

685
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:05,395
and sister Mahalia Jackson was my idol.

686
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:09,191
She was my hero. I loved her so much.

687
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:11,902
This day, I sit right next to her...

688
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:15,781
and when came time for her to sing,
she leaned over and told me...

689
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:19,117
"Baby, Halie don't feel too good today.

690
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:21,620
"I need you to help me sing this song."

691
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:23,872
And I said, "Yes, ma'am, I'll help you."

692
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:29,336
Precious Lord is of course
so meaningful to us...

693
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:32,464
who was in Memphis on that fateful day.

694
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:38,762
Memphis, Lorraine Motel. April third,'68.

695
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:40,639
We stayed in the room all day long...

696
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:44,977
playing, throwing pillows on the bed,
we were trying to relax.

697
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:47,396
We went to Mason Temple that night...

698
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:50,190
it was raining, lightning was flashing.

699
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:53,068
Doctor King gave the Mountaintop speech.

700
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:56,947
And he's allowed me to go
up to the mountain.

701
00:44:57,114 --> 00:45:03,203
And I've looked over
and I've seen the promised land.

702
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:04,830
He saw it!

703
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,136
Next day was April fourth...

704
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:22,890
we were prepared to perform
for Doctor King that night at the rally.

705
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:26,351
On that fateful day...

706
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:29,271
Ben Branch and I were walking together.

707
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:33,817
As we walked across the courtyard...

708
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:38,989
Doctor King came to the door
full of glee and joy.

709
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:43,994
And then he said,
"Jesse, it's time to eat."

710
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:49,249
He said, "Jesse,
you don't even have a tie for dinner."

711
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:54,546
And he said to Ben...

712
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:57,382
"You should play my favorite song,
My Precious Lord."

713
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:00,219
He raised up and pow!

714
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:13,440
Doctor King laid there
with his spine severed...

715
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:15,984
and his face blown off...

716
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:19,571
but he didn't die crying and die afraid.

717
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:22,908
He died asking the Lord
to lead his hand...

718
00:46:23,075 --> 00:46:26,745
to help him lead us, all of us.

719
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:31,333
I just wanted to shout.

720
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:34,837
And, Lord, standing there
with sister Mahalia Jackson...

721
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:37,714
I got up and I started that song.

722
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:41,343
It was just an unreal moment for me.

723
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:50,102
Precious Lord

724
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:59,903
Take my hand

725
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:08,704
Lead me on

726
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:11,790
Yeah, oh, yeah

727
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:17,546
Oh yeah, oh, yeah, let me stand

728
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:26,722
I am tired

729
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:29,099
Yes, I am

730
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:35,022
I'm weak

731
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:42,946
Lord, yeah, Lord, yeah

732
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:48,076
I am worn, hey, yeah

733
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:53,624
But through

734
00:47:55,709 --> 00:48:00,964
Through the storm

735
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:06,887
Yeah, yeah, yeah

736
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:11,266
Through the night

737
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:16,188
Lead

738
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:22,027
Lead me on

739
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:25,739
To the light

740
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:30,827
Take

741
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:33,622
Take my hand

742
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:42,339
Precious Lord

743
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:49,721
And lead, lead me home

744
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:04,486
When my way

745
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:14,580
Groweth drear

746
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:24,590
Precious Lord

747
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,139
Lord

748
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:37,769
I want you to linger near

749
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:40,772
Lord, you know, Lord

750
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:48,363
When my light

751
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:57,497
Is almost

752
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:03,212
Gone

753
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:08,634
Oh, Lord

754
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,094
You know, Lord

755
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:13,847
You know, Lord

756
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:18,769
And through the storm

757
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,537
Oh, I will stand

758
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:37,955
Yeah!

759
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:41,834
-Oh, light my feet
-Light my feet

760
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,004
Whoa, yeah

761
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:47,506
-Hold me, Lord
-Hold

762
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:49,091
-Hold me, Lord
-Hold

763
00:50:49,258 --> 00:50:50,843
-I want you to hold me
-Hold

764
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:52,177
-Take me to you
-Hold

765
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:53,679
-Take me to you
-Hold

766
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:55,222
-Hold on to me
-Hold

767
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:56,765
-Hold on to me
-Hold

768
00:50:56,932 --> 00:50:58,475
I need ya

769
00:51:00,853 --> 00:51:05,774
Precious Lord

770
00:51:05,941 --> 00:51:09,152
Take

771
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:27,004
Oh, your child

772
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:30,215
Lead your child home

773
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:32,634
Home

774
00:51:32,801 --> 00:51:37,222
Oh, yeah

775
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:47,566
Man, I'm tellin' you,
that was the time of my life.

776
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:52,487
When she gave me that microphone back,
I said, "Oh, she likes what I'm doin'."

777
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:10,005
And I was honored.

778
00:52:10,172 --> 00:52:13,175
I'm tellin' you,
that is still my biggest honor...

779
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:18,013
to be able to sing on the same microphone
with sister Mahalia Jackson.

780
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,641
She remains the greatest.

781
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,937
And when you talk about music...

782
00:52:25,103 --> 00:52:28,857
this Black festival
is some of every kind...

783
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:31,026
is some of every style.

784
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:35,405
Jazz, blues, gospel, all of it is good.

785
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:37,991
All of it makes you feel good.

786
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:47,209
Ladies and gentlemen...

787
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:52,214
that was only the first 15 minutes
of Black history going on here in Harlem.

788
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:59,847
The festival was such a cross-section of
the music that was happening at the time.

789
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:01,682
We got a few surprises comin' up here.

790
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:05,227
People that you didn't even know
thought about what it's all about.

791
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:09,064
Some people came
because they were truly into the music.

792
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:10,983
Some came for one act.

793
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,235
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

794
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:18,448
Motown moves to Soulville
here in Harlem in Mount Morris Park.

795
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:21,660
My group of friends loved Motown.

796
00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:25,455
One of the greatest song stylists
of our time.

797
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:28,333
He's a superstar.

798
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:34,631
He's tall, dark, handsome...

799
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:40,262
David Ruffin!

800
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,227
I'd like to go back
to the olden days, huh?

801
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:50,939
To the thing I have for you.
Simply goes like this...

802
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:53,859
I've got sunshine

803
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,946
On a cloudy day

804
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:03,619
Whenever it's cold outside

805
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:05,871
I've got the month of May

806
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:08,165
Can I get you to sing along
with me one time?

807
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:10,083
Well, I guess

808
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,545
-I guess you'd say
-I can't hear you.

809
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:17,633
What can make me feel this way

810
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:19,718
It's my girl

811
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,681
Talking about my girl, yeah

812
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:31,647
I've got so much honey

813
00:54:31,813 --> 00:54:35,442
The bees envy me
Yes, darlin'

814
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:39,363
And I've got a sweeter song

815
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,657
Than any bird in any tree

816
00:54:41,823 --> 00:54:43,033
How you doing, brother?

817
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:49,289
Well, I guess you would say

818
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:54,044
What pretty new girl could
Make a man like me feel this way?

819
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:58,549
It's my girl, whoa, baby

820
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:01,593
Talkin' about nobody but my girl

821
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,814
David had just left the Temptations.

822
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:15,399
Hey, hey-hey-hey

823
00:55:15,566 --> 00:55:17,192
The Temptations were my guys.

824
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,569
I wanna hear you sing!

825
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:21,280
My friends and I,
we were suit-and-tie guys.

826
00:55:21,446 --> 00:55:23,407
We thought we were the backups.

827
00:55:23,574 --> 00:55:25,117
We couldn't sing,
we couldn't do anything...

828
00:55:25,284 --> 00:55:27,870
but we thought we could dance,
we had all the moves down.

829
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:33,500
I've got all the riches, baby
One sweet man can claim

830
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,335
I love you, too, darling.

831
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:40,257
At the time, Motown was still one of the
most popular sounds in America.

832
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:43,719
Berry Gordy and his team
of Black showbiz professionals...

833
00:55:43,927 --> 00:55:47,139
created a whole assembly line
to make 'hood R and B palatable...

834
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:49,057
to the Wonder Bread
mainstream white America.

835
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:52,102
To put on wax Black people...

836
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:56,690
so that we can widen
the distribution of the Black ideas.

837
00:55:56,773 --> 00:55:57,941
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day

838
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:00,736
Those artists, they were role models...

839
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:02,112
these were our people...

840
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:05,365
creating things that made us feel good
about ourselves.

841
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:09,661
And to see them break through,
we were so proud.

842
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:10,996
My girl

843
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:33,852
I love to talk about my girl, yeah

844
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:47,741
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
we're gonna bring up some folks...

845
00:56:47,908 --> 00:56:49,076
I was nervous.

846
00:56:49,243 --> 00:56:51,328
We were so excited about being there...

847
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:55,249
we'd join our hands and say prayers
before we went on stage.

848
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:57,000
Gladys Knight.

849
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:02,756
Now, when I stepped on stage,
I was totally, totally taken aback

850
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,634
because I didn't expect a crowd like that.

851
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:07,219
And the Pips!

852
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:12,891
Oh, I bet you're wonderin' how I knew

853
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:17,855
Baby, baby, baby
'Bout your plan to make me blue

854
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:21,358
With some other girl you knew before

855
00:57:21,942 --> 00:57:25,445
Between the two of us girls
Ya know I love you more

856
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:29,783
It took me by surprise, I must say

857
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,952
When I found out yesterday

858
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:34,329
Don't ya know that I heard it
Through the grapevine

859
00:57:34,496 --> 00:57:36,248
Whoa, I heard it through the grapevine

860
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:39,543
-Not much longer would you be mine
-Not much longer would you be mine

861
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:41,712
Oh, don't ya know that I heard it
Through the grapevine

862
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:43,797
Whoa, I heard it through the grapevine

863
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:47,384
And I'm just about, just about,
Just about to lose my mind

864
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:48,552
Whoa, yes I am

865
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:52,139
Whoa, yes I am
Whoa, yes I am

866
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:54,183
Baby what you doin' to me

867
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:58,562
Oh, take a good look
At these tears in my eyes

868
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:03,192
Baby, baby, these tears
I can't hold on inside

869
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:07,196
Losin' you would end my life, you see

870
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:10,866
Because you mean that much to me

871
00:58:11,033 --> 00:58:14,745
You could've told me yourself

872
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:17,748
That you were lovin' somebody else

873
00:58:17,915 --> 00:58:19,291
Instead I heard it through the grapevine

874
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:20,792
Whoa, I heard it through the grapevine

875
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:23,253
Oh, not much longer would you be mine

876
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,757
Gladys Knight was everything to us.

877
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:29,218
She was the queen of soul.

878
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:31,094
She gave it to us good,
and the Pips were workin'.

879
00:58:31,303 --> 00:58:33,514
About to lose my mind
Whoa, yes, I am

880
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,184
Yes, I am
Yes, I am

881
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:44,566
I know you hear me, boy

882
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:48,779
At that time, we were up and coming,
believe it or not.

883
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,407
I was very young.

884
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:54,660
Motown was like our family.

885
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:57,371
In the beginning,
we all lived in the same neighborhood.

886
00:58:57,538 --> 00:59:00,749
Holland-Dozier lived on the corner,
we lived right here...

887
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:03,126
Martha and the Vandellas
lived right there...

888
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:05,379
the Temptations lived right behind us.

889
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:07,381
We were all together.

890
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:10,926
Cholly Atkins was our number-one guy.

891
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:13,929
He was the one
that taught us the routines.

892
00:59:14,096 --> 00:59:15,430
We worked, we worked...

893
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:19,184
we'd go in his basement at 7:00 a.m.
in the morning.

894
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:22,312
He kept us there until five or six o'clock
in the evening...

895
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:24,773
and if you
weren't doing his stuff right...

896
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:33,365
He was a father to us
as well as a choreographer.

897
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:37,327
America had started
to listen to this music...

898
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:40,330
and it took us
to a totally different level...

899
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:42,875
and from there, we went around the world.

900
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,626
Now bring it on down

901
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:50,132
Yes, I heard
Oh, yes, I did

902
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:53,302
Yes, I heard, oh

903
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:54,928
You know, it's strange

904
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:57,431
But the same thing happened
to my three guys

905
00:59:57,598 --> 00:59:58,599
-Hey, fellas
-Hey!

906
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:01,143
Come on and tell 'em
Just how you found out about it

907
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:06,231
Oh, I heard through the grapevine

908
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:09,735
Oh, I heard through the grapevine

909
01:00:09,902 --> 01:00:12,946
And I heard, heard, heard, heard, heard it
Through the grapevine

910
01:00:13,113 --> 01:00:16,408
And I heard, heard, heard, heard, heard it
Through the grapevine

911
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:22,497
Yes, I heard
Oh, yes, I did

912
01:00:22,664 --> 01:00:23,749
Yes, I heard

913
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:27,753
Motown was very interested
in us keeping our integrity.

914
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,756
Having class, being polite.

915
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:36,512
Hey, hey, hey
I heard it through the grapevine

916
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:41,642
But I knew something very, very important
was happening in Harlem that day.

917
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:43,060
I heard it

918
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:48,607
It wasn't just about the music.

919
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:56,782
We wanted progress.

920
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:03,872
We are Black people,
and we should be proud of this.

921
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:08,001
And we want our people,
we want our people lifting us up.

922
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:09,837
Gladys Knight and the Pips.

923
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:17,010
We believed in what we felt in here.

924
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:23,100
So, when we went out,
"Let's go! Let's go do it!"

925
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:36,989
At the Harlem Cultural Festival...

926
01:01:37,155 --> 01:01:40,701
you got a audience that's showing up
who's radicalized.

927
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:44,872
There's just this embrace of
neo-super Blackness.

928
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:46,665
That generation had evolved...

929
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:50,544
and Black music was moving into
this rapidly changing era...

930
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:52,588
of psychedelicized R and B.

931
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:55,507
Ladies and gentlemen...

932
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:59,386
the internationally known...

933
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:02,139
the dynamic...

934
01:02:02,306 --> 01:02:05,809
Sly and the Family Stone.

935
01:02:07,477 --> 01:02:08,854
When you saw a Black group...

936
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:13,192
what you expected to see was,
generally speaking, all men,

937
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:16,069
all dressed in matching suits...

938
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:20,365
ready even before they hit the stage
to perform.

939
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:21,909
He introduced Sly...

940
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:24,661
and the first thing
that happens to the audience...

941
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:27,122
is the feeling of apprehension...

942
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:32,002
because just because they introduced Sly
doesn't mean he's there.

943
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:37,466
It also doesn't mean
he's coming out immediately.

944
01:02:37,633 --> 01:02:39,051
Ladies and gentlemen...

945
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:41,512
we're gonna have to stop the show
if you keep on pushing.

946
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:43,347
We're gonna
have to stop the show right here.

947
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:48,060
So, the group would kind of saunter out.

948
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:51,730
I remember it being
a beautiful, sunny day.

949
01:02:51,897 --> 01:02:54,149
We hit the stage late...

950
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:56,860
and I remember,
"Jeez, there's a big crowd here"

951
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:58,403
and this was Harlem.

952
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:02,908
The instruments weren't tuned.

953
01:03:03,075 --> 01:03:05,619
You're wondering, "What are they doing
with girls in the group?

954
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:07,913
"What is white people doing up there?"

955
01:03:08,622 --> 01:03:10,874
We started tuning up, you know, bam!

956
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:12,960
Hit the snare, kicks, that's good.

957
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:15,838
Almost like a loose tuning jam.

958
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:17,965
And a white guy is the drummer?

959
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:21,385
We couldn't get this thing,
that the white guy is the drummer.

960
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:24,763
You know, he's not supposed to be able
to do that.

961
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,391
They came to check us out.

962
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:29,601
You know, "What you got?"

963
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:32,938
And probably Jerry and I
were the only two white people there.

964
01:03:34,022 --> 01:03:37,192
As soon as everything
was kicking, it was on.

965
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:41,196
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

966
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,574
I'm talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin'

967
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,325
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'

968
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:50,038
I'm livin', livin', livin', livin', hey

969
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:54,543
Time is passin', I grow older
Things are happenin' fast

970
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:58,255
All I have to hold on to
Is a simple song at last

971
01:03:58,422 --> 01:03:59,423
Let me hear you say

972
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:05,429
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya

973
01:04:07,973 --> 01:04:13,937
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya

974
01:04:18,984 --> 01:04:24,114
Sing a simple song

975
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:29,578
Try a little do re mi fa so la ti do

976
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:53,352
Sly and the Family Stone
was such a game changer on so many levels.

977
01:04:54,853 --> 01:04:58,023
They are kind of our first two-tone
soul group.

978
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:01,860
They were bringing gender parity
into the presentation.

979
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:03,946
Everybody sing together

980
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:08,075
To see a Black woman playin' a trumpet
made me feel great.

981
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:13,288
Ya, ya, ya, ya
Sing it in the shower, ya

982
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:16,750
Sly came up in the church,
so he's got all that vernacular.

983
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:20,838
He used to be a DJ in the middle of the
Haight-Ashbury revolution...

984
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,882
so he's coming from the epicenter
of transformative cool...

985
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:26,927
transformative hip,
politically savvy America.

986
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:29,847
He's a conservatory student
and a multi-instrumentalist...

987
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:32,558
so there's
the proto-Prince factor going on.

988
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:37,479
Sly wanted to address
everybody and everything.

989
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,232
Music was the common denominator.

990
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:42,901
And music made you want to challenge

991
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:45,195
social aspects
that needed to be challenged.

992
01:05:45,362 --> 01:05:47,573
Everybody do their thing,
and that's what we did.

993
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:51,702
You're in trouble when you find
It's hard for you to smile

994
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:56,790
A simple song might make it better
For a little while, hey

995
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:06,967
This is clearly a band...

996
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:11,471
with an evangelical sense of their church
of psychedelic soul.

997
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:13,473
It's the ministry of fun.

998
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:21,106
My friend Ethel Beatty,
we loved Sly and the Family Stone.

999
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,191
We loved them.

1000
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:25,777
We said, "Listen,
we can't let this pass up."

1001
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:30,949
But I could not say that we were going
to see a concert to my mother.

1002
01:06:31,116 --> 01:06:32,534
We had to connive.

1003
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:35,037
Maybe I told a fib.

1004
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:37,080
I said I was going to visit my aunt.

1005
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:38,624
We said we were going shopping.

1006
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:43,962
I am everyday people

1007
01:06:44,129 --> 01:06:46,298
We walked to the park.

1008
01:06:46,465 --> 01:06:50,844
I am everyday people

1009
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,222
And we ended up on the front row.

1010
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:59,686
The energy was indescribable.
More than excitement.

1011
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:04,191
Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong

1012
01:07:05,317 --> 01:07:08,612
My own beliefs are in my song

1013
01:07:08,779 --> 01:07:12,324
The butcher, the banker
the drummer and then

1014
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:15,953
Makes no difference what group I'm in

1015
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:22,626
I am everyday people
Yeah, yeah

1016
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:27,840
There is a blue one who can't accept
The green one for living with

1017
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:30,717
A fat one tryin' to be a skinny one

1018
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:34,054
Different strokes for different folks

1019
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:38,308
And so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby

1020
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:45,190
We got to live together

1021
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:49,027
I am no better and neither are you

1022
01:07:49,194 --> 01:07:52,364
We all the same, whatever we do

1023
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:56,243
You love me, you hate me
You know me and then

1024
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:59,705
You can't figure out the bag I'm in

1025
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:04,126
I am everyday people

1026
01:08:04,293 --> 01:08:06,879
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1027
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:10,299
There is a longhair
That doesn't like the shorthair

1028
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:14,178
For being such a rich one
That will not help the poor one

1029
01:08:14,344 --> 01:08:17,598
Different strokes for different folks

1030
01:08:17,764 --> 01:08:21,643
And so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby

1031
01:08:25,147 --> 01:08:28,609
We got to live together

1032
01:08:28,774 --> 01:08:32,404
There is a yellow one that can't
Accept the black one

1033
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:35,823
That won't accept the red one
That won't accept the white one

1034
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:39,536
Different strokes for different folks

1035
01:08:39,703 --> 01:08:43,122
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo

1036
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:49,962
I am everyday people

1037
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:54,176
As I said, my group of four guys,
we were suit-and-tie guys.

1038
01:08:55,511 --> 01:09:00,724
Then we saw Sly,
and we were no longer suit-and-tie guys.

1039
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:05,562
I am everyday people

1040
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:07,564
The change was in effect.

1041
01:09:25,624 --> 01:09:28,085
Watermelon man

1042
01:09:33,756 --> 01:09:35,884
Watermelon man

1043
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:52,067
When you looked at the audience...

1044
01:09:52,234 --> 01:09:56,321
you could see the change in the scene
as it was happening.

1045
01:09:56,488 --> 01:10:00,158
There would still be people
in silk and wool and sharkskin...

1046
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:04,288
but you would see the bell-bottoms,
the cut-off shirts.

1047
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:11,837
You saw platform shoes, hip-huggers,
men wearing no shirt and leather vests.

1048
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:14,548
It was hip, you know. It was real hip.

1049
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:20,304
At that time,
Harlem was a melting pot of Black style.

1050
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:26,560
When we got into the late '60s,
there was a new movement.

1051
01:10:26,643 --> 01:10:28,270
Afrocentric.

1052
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:31,815
It's a revolution, style revolution,
cultural revolution.

1053
01:10:31,982 --> 01:10:34,818
We found that the African styles
just suit us better.

1054
01:10:34,985 --> 01:10:37,404
I could remember dashikis.

1055
01:10:37,571 --> 01:10:40,199
Everybody had a dashiki.
I think I had a dashiki.

1056
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:43,952
Now, the dashiki is an adaptation
of an African piece.

1057
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:46,872
What we mean when we say dashiki,
is freedom.

1058
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,958
So it's a freedom suit.
I can move in any direction.

1059
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:51,251
I never am attacked.

1060
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:53,712
The hair was the biggest change.

1061
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:55,047
Afros.

1062
01:10:55,214 --> 01:10:57,966
My generation say it looks nice.

1063
01:10:58,133 --> 01:11:01,386
The older generation
thinks it's ridiculous.

1064
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:03,430
The three of us, me, Yvonne and Cleety,

1065
01:11:03,722 --> 01:11:07,309
we all had our natural 'dos,
we couldn't wait to get our hair nappy.

1066
01:11:07,476 --> 01:11:10,896
Black people who, unfortunately,
was born in this country...

1067
01:11:11,063 --> 01:11:14,024
are trying to establish our identity.

1068
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:17,319
This is just about all we have left
to identify ourselves as.

1069
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,699
That festival brought in
the different cultures.

1070
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:27,162
Caribbean, Afrocentric,
all the Latin and Cuban.

1071
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:34,461
Mongo Santamaria at this festival,
at this time in Harlem in the '60s

1072
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:38,507
is the nexus of the Black and brown
communities that make up Uptown New York.

1073
01:11:38,674 --> 01:11:40,676
Watermelon man

1074
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:43,595
His first hit, Herbie Hancock's
Watermelon Man...

1075
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:47,516
is where Cuban music meets jazz.

1076
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:53,480
The festival, it's a political statement
of Black and brown communities.

1077
01:12:01,822 --> 01:12:06,034
Ladies and gentlemen,
we bring you Harlem's very own...

1078
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:11,456
the young man who put the soul
into the Latin music, Ray Barretto.

1079
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:46,575
A New Yorican,
it's a New Yorker with Puerto Rican roots.

1080
01:12:46,742 --> 01:12:49,953
Ray Barretto, in particular,
was a New Yorican.

1081
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:55,667
He's a Puerto Rican New Yorker,
born here, raised here in Harlem.

1082
01:12:55,834 --> 01:12:57,002
He's the original New Yorican.

1083
01:12:57,169 --> 01:13:02,674
But has an unbelievable impact
on Puerto Rican music.

1084
01:13:06,428 --> 01:13:11,141
East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem,
was not just Puerto Ricans.

1085
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:14,520
You had Jamaicans,
you had African-American...

1086
01:13:14,686 --> 01:13:17,439
Cuban, Black Panamanian...

1087
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:22,319
and they brought with them
Afro-Cuban, Afro-Puerto Rican music.

1088
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:33,205
In '69, I lived in
El Barrio, East Harlem.

1089
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:38,418
There was music coming off of every
fire escape, out of every social club.

1090
01:13:38,585 --> 01:13:40,629
You hear the sound of drumming.

1091
01:13:40,796 --> 01:13:42,589
They have roosters crowing...

1092
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:45,175
guys that would sit out playing dominoes.

1093
01:13:45,342 --> 01:13:48,554
We all hung out together,
we danced together, we partied together.

1094
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,599
We were speaking a universal language,
the drum.

1095
01:13:56,478 --> 01:14:00,399
It goes back
to making the drum speak to people.

1096
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:07,197
The different rhythms
that each person has in the band,

1097
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:11,368
some of it's up, some of it's down,
but it goes like this.

1098
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:17,583
It comes together and it forms a bond
and a conversation.

1099
01:14:17,749 --> 01:14:20,419
And that conversation reads out
to the audience...

1100
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:23,630
and now they're listening
'cause they understand what you're saying.

1101
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:47,821
I got to perform with Ray
early on in my teens...

1102
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:50,449
and I learned a lot by watching him.

1103
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:56,205
Ray's playing, it's all in the wrist,
and that's what I learned.

1104
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:59,041
That's how I play. More with the wrist.

1105
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:02,836
Mongo's different from Ray Barretto.

1106
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:04,505
He's not just using the tips.

1107
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:08,592
He's using his entire hand to play
and all of his arm.

1108
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:11,136
And the power.

1109
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:13,180
If you ever shook his hand...

1110
01:15:13,347 --> 01:15:15,724
all of his fingers would almost be
the same size.

1111
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:20,270
They were swollen
like a club from playing.

1112
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:30,447
Those artists crossed genres. They're
trying to reunite people with music.

1113
01:15:30,614 --> 01:15:32,616
Bringing people together,
that's what it's about.

1114
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:34,743
Now, I know a beautiful truth.

1115
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:38,413
I know that in my blood...

1116
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:42,167
I got Black and white...

1117
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:46,004
red, Puerto Rican, Indian.

1118
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:50,884
I'm all messed up,
but I got soul, I know it.

1119
01:15:51,885 --> 01:15:56,223
And so, in every face,
in every face I see...

1120
01:15:56,390 --> 01:16:01,311
I see a part of you and you
and you and me...

1121
01:16:01,478 --> 01:16:03,146
Together

1122
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:07,734
The power of music
is to tell our own stories.

1123
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,237
We hold a mirror to ourselves.

1124
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:13,782
We write the music
that comes from inside us.

1125
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:15,409
And other people say, "That's me, too."

1126
01:16:16,535 --> 01:16:18,996
I said, everybody get together

1127
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:21,456
Got to do it all if we gonna live...

1128
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:24,293
not on the moon,
right here on Earth, baby.

1129
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:29,756
We got to do it all together
before it's too goddamn late.

1130
01:16:43,896 --> 01:16:44,938
Go for landing.

1131
01:16:45,105 --> 01:16:46,481
We're a go. Same type. We're a go.

1132
01:16:46,648 --> 01:16:48,483
Come on now, let's go to sing out.

1133
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:49,651
Okay, 75 feet.

1134
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:50,819
Yeah!

1135
01:16:50,986 --> 01:16:52,696
There's looking good.

1136
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,449
-60 seconds.
-Lights on.

1137
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:56,617
Some are pushin' hard

1138
01:16:56,783 --> 01:16:58,076
Drifting to the right a little.

1139
01:16:58,243 --> 01:16:59,620
Some are holdin' back

1140
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:00,996
Kickin' up some dust.

1141
01:17:01,163 --> 01:17:02,372
You know it's a shame

1142
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:03,540
30 seconds.

1143
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:04,875
The way some people act

1144
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:06,293
Three feet and two and a half down.

1145
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,086
The president said

1146
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:09,254
Okay, engine stop.

1147
01:17:09,338 --> 01:17:10,339
That we would overcome

1148
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:11,965
Tranquility Base here.

1149
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:13,425
We gotta keep pushin' a whole lot

1150
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:14,593
The Eagle has landed.

1151
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:15,802
Till the work is done

1152
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:19,056
Man on the moon. Oh, boy, boy.

1153
01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:23,477
It's been a change
It's been a change

1154
01:17:23,644 --> 01:17:25,979
-This whole world has been a change
-Danger!

1155
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:29,441
Sunday, July 20th, 1969...

1156
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:32,819
during the Harlem Cultural Festival...

1157
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:35,531
man landed on the moon.

1158
01:17:35,697 --> 01:17:37,282
Hooray.

1159
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:38,492
Things have been

1160
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:39,743
It's a great thing for this country.

1161
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:40,953
Won't be no more

1162
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:42,496
I can't believe that that just happened.

1163
01:17:42,663 --> 01:17:43,664
It may be late

1164
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:44,873
It was terrific.

1165
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:46,375
Or it may be soon

1166
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,168
It's a great technological achievement.

1167
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:49,336
One of these days

1168
01:17:49,419 --> 01:17:50,462
It's really unbelievable.

1169
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:52,089
There'll be a man on the moon

1170
01:17:52,256 --> 01:17:53,257
I'm very emotional.

1171
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:55,676
I just hope they make it back.

1172
01:17:56,134 --> 01:17:57,427
I felt the world got closer today.

1173
01:17:57,594 --> 01:17:59,930
I felt we all got to know each other
that much more.

1174
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:02,975
This whole world has made a change

1175
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:06,562
Well, there was a large crowd
gathered in Harlem this afternoon.

1176
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:09,565
For some of the reaction there,
correspondent Bill Plante.

1177
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:14,736
There are 40,000, perhaps 50,000 people
at Mount Morris Park in Harlem...

1178
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:17,447
but they are not here
watching the moon landing.

1179
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:19,867
They are here at the soul festival...

1180
01:18:20,033 --> 01:18:23,412
part of the third annual
Harlem Cultural Festival.

1181
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:24,705
And for many of them...

1182
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:28,917
this is far more relevant
than the mission of Apollo 11.

1183
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:30,961
What's your feeling
now that the astronauts

1184
01:18:31,044 --> 01:18:32,754
have landed safely on the moon?

1185
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:33,922
I think it's very important...

1186
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:36,091
but I don't think it's any more relevant
than, you know...

1187
01:18:36,175 --> 01:18:37,593
the Harlem Cultural Festival here.

1188
01:18:37,676 --> 01:18:38,719
I think it's equal.

1189
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:39,887
What are your thoughts?

1190
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:41,054
As far as science goes...

1191
01:18:41,221 --> 01:18:44,600
and everybody that's involved
with the moon landing and astronauts...

1192
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:48,061
it's beautiful, you know.
Like me, I couldn't care less.

1193
01:18:48,228 --> 01:18:49,730
This means more to you than that.

1194
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:50,898
Yeah, much more.

1195
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:52,691
The cash they wasted,
as far as I'm concerned...

1196
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:54,860
in getting to the moon
could have been used

1197
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:56,945
to feed poor Black people in Harlem...

1198
01:18:57,112 --> 01:18:59,823
and all over the place.
All over this country.

1199
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,533
So, like, you know, like,
never mind the moon...

1200
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,785
let's get some of that cash in Harlem.

1201
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:05,454
There's been a change and you might be

1202
01:19:05,537 --> 01:19:06,997
the president
of the United States one day.

1203
01:19:07,164 --> 01:19:09,458
Listen, all of you young people,
this is your verse.

1204
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:12,252
You young people

1205
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:13,837
I think it's a waste of money.

1206
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:15,130
Stay in school

1207
01:19:15,297 --> 01:19:16,965
People are going hungry
all over the United States.

1208
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:18,175
Study hard

1209
01:19:18,383 --> 01:19:19,551
Let's do something about poverty now.

1210
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:20,719
And obey the rules

1211
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:21,970
Straightening out our problems.

1212
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:23,222
You may be young

1213
01:19:23,388 --> 01:19:24,515
There's so many people who need help.

1214
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:26,892
And you may be able

1215
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,602
Haven't got an education

1216
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:30,562
What's up there on the moon? Nothing.

1217
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:31,772
Can't get common labor

1218
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:34,566
It's groovy for certain people
but not for the Black man in America.

1219
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:35,817
It's been a change

1220
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:38,987
Well, here's the way
I look at it. Like that.

1221
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:42,366
Black man wants to go to Africa,
white man's going to the moon.

1222
01:19:42,533 --> 01:19:43,825
I'm gonna stay in Harlem
with the Puerto Ricans...

1223
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:45,452
and have me some fun.

1224
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:49,790
I had a dream last night,
and in it, I went to the moon.

1225
01:19:50,707 --> 01:19:51,750
-You went to the moon?
-Yeah.

1226
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:53,460
Did you go up in the Apollo?

1227
01:19:53,627 --> 01:19:55,420
No, I went up in an Edsel.

1228
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:57,422
Well, look, tell me more about that.

1229
01:19:57,589 --> 01:19:59,299
-What happened? Did you plant the flag?
-No.

1230
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:01,385
-You didn't plant a flag?
-No, man.

1231
01:20:01,552 --> 01:20:03,679
-What did you do?
-Planted a sign.

1232
01:20:03,846 --> 01:20:06,473
-What did the sign say?
-"For sale. Cheap."

1233
01:20:09,059 --> 01:20:12,145
A man done gone to the moon.

1234
01:20:16,567 --> 01:20:20,571
I went as far as Baltimore with them,
then I got off.

1235
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:27,035
In Harlem, people,
they're not focusing on the moon...

1236
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:29,746
they're dealing
with the everyday realities.

1237
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:33,876
'69 was a tough time for Harlem
because of the heroin epidemic.

1238
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:36,170
What do you think is the most
pressing issue for Black folk?

1239
01:20:36,336 --> 01:20:39,548
The number-one thing
is the narcotics addiction in this area.

1240
01:20:39,715 --> 01:20:41,675
I would say the drugs, at this point.

1241
01:20:41,842 --> 01:20:44,178
What do you think is the cause
for this influx of drug use...

1242
01:20:44,344 --> 01:20:45,345
in the Black communities?

1243
01:20:45,512 --> 01:20:48,640
One of the reasons is
because of the great oppression...

1244
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:51,852
which white racists, you know,
places on the Black community.

1245
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:54,396
And this is one way
of alleviating the pain.

1246
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:58,192
I was addicted for 16 years.

1247
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,195
I lost my job, I lost my family,
my wife kicked me out.

1248
01:21:02,821 --> 01:21:04,489
Bad things were happening to Harlem.

1249
01:21:04,656 --> 01:21:07,242
Businesses were closin',
lot of people leavin'...

1250
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:08,911
the buildings became abandoned.

1251
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:12,956
We are living in economic colonialism
based on money...

1252
01:21:13,123 --> 01:21:15,918
where the greedy are exploiting the needy.

1253
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:18,962
Where we are more concerned
about the moon than men.

1254
01:21:19,129 --> 01:21:21,298
Somebody better wake up.

1255
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:24,426
This is a country with a gross national
product of nearly a trillion dollars.

1256
01:21:24,593 --> 01:21:25,636
The money is here.

1257
01:21:25,802 --> 01:21:28,263
Any country that can fight
an unpopular war...

1258
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,807
spend more money on weapons
than any other single item...

1259
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:34,895
and send men to the moon, baby,
that country has really got the bread.

1260
01:21:35,229 --> 01:21:40,192
But what the moon shot proves again
is that what America hasn't got is soul.

1261
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:48,075
Funky, funky, funky, funky
Let's get funky

1262
01:21:54,748 --> 01:21:55,832
Your precious sweetheart

1263
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:58,752
She's so faithful

1264
01:21:58,919 --> 01:22:02,714
She's so true, whoa, yeah

1265
01:22:02,881 --> 01:22:06,134
Her dreams are tumblin'
Her world is crumblin'

1266
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:09,221
Because of you

1267
01:22:10,973 --> 01:22:14,935
One day you'll hurt her
Just once too much

1268
01:22:15,102 --> 01:22:19,189
And when you finally
lose your tender touch

1269
01:22:19,356 --> 01:22:24,111
Oh, oh
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day

1270
01:22:24,278 --> 01:22:26,864
Her feet may wander
Her heart may stray

1271
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:28,407
Oh, yeah

1272
01:22:28,574 --> 01:22:32,202
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-na-nee

1273
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:34,913
You're gonna send your baby straight to me

1274
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:39,001
I'm gonna give her all the lovin'

1275
01:22:39,168 --> 01:22:43,005
Within my heart, oh, yeah

1276
01:22:43,172 --> 01:22:48,177
I'm gonna patch up every single
Little dream you tore apart

1277
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:50,846
I felt very honored to be there.

1278
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:55,309
I could feel the energy of so many people.

1279
01:22:55,475 --> 01:23:00,022
I was 19. I was at a crossroad.

1280
01:23:00,189 --> 01:23:02,524
Obviously, I had some success.

1281
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:07,070
We had done For Once in My Life,
I Was Made to Love Her, and Up-Tight...

1282
01:23:07,237 --> 01:23:08,947
and many songs.

1283
01:23:10,324 --> 01:23:14,286
But I had the feeling
the world was wanting a change.

1284
01:23:14,912 --> 01:23:19,333
We were moving into a whole 'nother
time and space with music and with sound.

1285
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:21,001
Yeah

1286
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:23,962
You better listen to me, yeah, yeah

1287
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:28,800
Heartaches are callin'
Tears are fallin' over you

1288
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:36,683
And when you're gone
I'm the one to go to her rescue

1289
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:38,602
Understand me

1290
01:23:38,769 --> 01:23:42,689
You're gonna leave her
One too many times

1291
01:23:42,856 --> 01:23:47,361
And when you come back
She's gonna be mine, all mine

1292
01:23:47,528 --> 01:23:51,823
In '69, Stevie's bordering on,
is he gonna be like the Temptations...

1293
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:54,743
singing his '60s hits
for the rest of his life,

1294
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:57,412
or is he gonna have this breakthrough?

1295
01:23:57,579 --> 01:24:00,207
It would have been very easy
to sit where he was.

1296
01:24:00,374 --> 01:24:03,502
To be that famous and not lazy,
is amazing.

1297
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:21,121
I enjoyed doing those songs...

1298
01:25:21,288 --> 01:25:23,624
but there was this thing
in my heart that said...

1299
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:26,460
"Okay, there is so much more
that you're writing."

1300
01:25:26,627 --> 01:25:30,714
Where was this going to lead me,
what was my motivation?

1301
01:25:34,676 --> 01:25:35,677
People would say to me...

1302
01:25:35,844 --> 01:25:38,263
"Hey, you shouldn't say this,
you shouldn't talk about that...

1303
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:41,517
"you're gonna mess your career up,
you're gonna mess your records up."

1304
01:25:42,351 --> 01:25:45,103
In my mind, I said,
"I don't give a four-letter word."

1305
01:25:46,772 --> 01:25:50,817
I never wanted to let fear
put my dreams to sleep.

1306
01:25:53,987 --> 01:25:56,406
Stevie is getting
into political involvement.

1307
01:25:56,615 --> 01:25:59,993
I'm definitely for it.
I'm for people registering and voting.

1308
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:04,540
I want people to start doing things.
Action is important, gaining power.

1309
01:26:04,706 --> 01:26:06,250
We know we've got the soul power.

1310
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:07,793
I would like to raise money.

1311
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,586
We've got forty million starving people.

1312
01:26:09,753 --> 01:26:11,213
We are dealing with joblessness.

1313
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:12,840
Racism is in this country.

1314
01:26:13,006 --> 01:26:14,091
We're dealing with homelessness.

1315
01:26:14,258 --> 01:26:16,760
Stevie was performing
for over 10,000 people.

1316
01:26:16,927 --> 01:26:20,722
To demand Doctor Martin Luther King's
birthday become a national holiday.

1317
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:22,391
If something new doesn't happen now...

1318
01:26:22,599 --> 01:26:24,852
We are not African, we are not European...

1319
01:26:25,102 --> 01:26:28,397
we are a new people.
We are a beautiful people.

1320
01:26:28,564 --> 01:26:33,026
I had pride in the fact
that I was a Black man.

1321
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:35,320
-I am Black.
-I am Black.

1322
01:26:35,487 --> 01:26:36,905
-I am beautiful.
-I am beautiful.

1323
01:26:37,072 --> 01:26:38,490
I am proud.

1324
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:42,578
'69 was the pivotal year...

1325
01:26:42,744 --> 01:26:47,416
where the Negro died
and Black was born.

1326
01:27:02,806 --> 01:27:06,310
It was a significant change
calling yourself Black.

1327
01:27:06,602 --> 01:27:10,314
In the early '60s,
if you called someone Black...

1328
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:15,277
it meant you wanted to fight them.
'Cause no one wanted to hear that mess.

1329
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:19,198
Why do we think of Black as bad
and white as good?

1330
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:23,368
White symbolizes purity,
honesty, innocence.

1331
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:27,414
Black represents evil,
wickedness, and gloom.

1332
01:27:27,581 --> 01:27:30,667
Whites gave "Black" its negative meaning.

1333
01:27:34,004 --> 01:27:36,507
In 1969, I was working
at The New York Times...

1334
01:27:36,673 --> 01:27:39,009
and I spent a lot of time in Harlem.

1335
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:44,389
And for the first time, I wrote "Black"
instead of "Negro" in a story...

1336
01:27:44,556 --> 01:27:45,974
because I listened to the community.

1337
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:48,810
I listened to the people
who were calling for the change.

1338
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:51,313
But some white editor...

1339
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:56,026
changed my wording
from "Black" back to "Negro."

1340
01:27:56,193 --> 01:27:58,654
I was so upset.

1341
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:03,408
I dictated an 11-page memo
calling for the change.

1342
01:28:03,575 --> 01:28:06,161
And the editor, Abe Rosenthal, said...

1343
01:28:06,328 --> 01:28:08,247
"Fine, that's what we're gonna do."

1344
01:28:08,413 --> 01:28:10,749
From that point on,
at The New York Times...

1345
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:15,504
people of color, this color,
were referred to as Black.

1346
01:28:17,673 --> 01:28:19,842
We were Black and we were proud.

1347
01:28:20,008 --> 01:28:23,846
When we started singin' freedom songs,
message songs,

1348
01:28:23,929 --> 01:28:26,056
the Black Panthers, Fred Hampton...

1349
01:28:26,223 --> 01:28:28,892
Stokely and his boys
would come hear us sing.

1350
01:28:29,059 --> 01:28:31,270
And they would let
my sister Yvonne and I know...

1351
01:28:31,436 --> 01:28:33,730
"We're watching y'all,
ain't nobody gonna mess with y'all."

1352
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:36,525
Black militancy
and its accent on Black pride...

1353
01:28:36,692 --> 01:28:38,652
is having a growing effect
across the country.

1354
01:28:38,819 --> 01:28:43,532
1969, I was droppin' out of college
to make a revolution.

1355
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:47,286
The people have the power to force some
kind of justice being done in society...

1356
01:28:47,452 --> 01:28:49,079
because only when the power is in
the hands of the people...

1357
01:28:49,246 --> 01:28:50,330
is anything gonna get done.

1358
01:28:50,497 --> 01:28:53,917
When we kicked off the Young Lords Party
in New York.

1359
01:28:54,084 --> 01:28:58,046
Tactics have included a garbage blockade,
the occupation of a neighborhood church.

1360
01:28:58,255 --> 01:29:00,591
They also occupied, for a time,
part of a hospital.

1361
01:29:00,757 --> 01:29:02,759
We're fighting for our own people,
Puerto Ricans...

1362
01:29:03,302 --> 01:29:05,304
but it's a fight that's in the interest
of Black people...

1363
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:07,890
of poor white people in this country,
the Asian-Americans.

1364
01:29:08,098 --> 01:29:11,602
We were in complete harmony
with the Black Panthers.

1365
01:29:11,768 --> 01:29:13,395
We were tired of what was happenin'.

1366
01:29:13,562 --> 01:29:17,191
The police runnin' amok,
beatin' up on all kinds of people.

1367
01:29:17,274 --> 01:29:18,901
Young men is killed by the police.

1368
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:22,529
-Who is this?
-Huey P. Newton.

1369
01:29:22,696 --> 01:29:24,156
And where is Huey?

1370
01:29:24,323 --> 01:29:25,574
In jail.

1371
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:26,867
Who put him there?

1372
01:29:27,034 --> 01:29:28,035
The pigs.

1373
01:29:28,243 --> 01:29:32,873
At the same time as the festival, the
Panther 21 trial was happening downtown.

1374
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,584
I want everybody in Harlem
to get this record down.

1375
01:29:35,792 --> 01:29:38,003
We got some brothers
that are political prisoners.

1376
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:40,881
21 Panthers locked up here in New York.

1377
01:29:41,048 --> 01:29:45,719
As activists, we were making a complete
and total commitment.

1378
01:29:45,886 --> 01:29:47,304
It was like going to war...

1379
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:52,434
and we were propelled on a wave of music.

1380
01:30:05,864 --> 01:30:07,366
With Black musical expression...

1381
01:30:07,533 --> 01:30:09,826
there's a certain kind
of release and catharsis.

1382
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:12,329
There's also rage, there's also trauma.

1383
01:30:15,332 --> 01:30:17,709
This notion of spirit possession
from Africa...

1384
01:30:17,876 --> 01:30:21,713
gets translated
into this horrific American experience.

1385
01:30:27,678 --> 01:30:29,429
The artists connect with the pain.

1386
01:30:29,596 --> 01:30:30,889
It's like, yeah, I want you to feel.

1387
01:30:31,056 --> 01:30:33,809
I want you to feel who Sonny Sharrock
really is right now.

1388
01:30:37,646 --> 01:30:39,857
There is a primal,
therapeutic aspect to it.

1389
01:30:40,023 --> 01:30:43,569
They call it "freedom music"
because it's what freedom feels like.

1390
01:31:03,255 --> 01:31:05,507
These musicians were expressing musically.

1391
01:31:05,674 --> 01:31:09,094
what we were thinking and feeling
politically and culturally.

1392
01:31:12,556 --> 01:31:15,017
When my dad put out a song
called It's Time...

1393
01:31:15,184 --> 01:31:18,061
he was not trying to be slick
and have a message.

1394
01:31:18,145 --> 01:31:19,396
No, that is the message.

1395
01:31:19,563 --> 01:31:23,108
It's our time, it's time, do it now.

1396
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:24,776
We want liberation.

1397
01:31:26,236 --> 01:31:28,113
He wanted to make change.

1398
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,741
An important step
for the Black artist to take...

1399
01:31:30,908 --> 01:31:33,327
is to engage ourselves in ownership...

1400
01:31:33,493 --> 01:31:37,414
of not only artistic properties,
but physical properties.

1401
01:31:37,581 --> 01:31:40,042
The theaters, the clubs,
the record companies.

1402
01:31:41,668 --> 01:31:45,088
But his record company
was not interested in politics.

1403
01:31:45,255 --> 01:31:47,049
It's like what they say
to the basketball players today...

1404
01:31:47,216 --> 01:31:50,594
"Just play basketball."
Well, they were saying, "Just play drums."

1405
01:31:54,848 --> 01:31:57,100
I was coming to hear Max and Abbey.

1406
01:31:57,309 --> 01:32:00,479
They were like our power couple,
but Black power.

1407
01:32:00,646 --> 01:32:03,315
I traveled here and yonder

1408
01:32:03,398 --> 01:32:06,026
I never found a home

1409
01:32:06,193 --> 01:32:10,864
I guess it must be written
All my life to roam

1410
01:32:11,031 --> 01:32:14,159
They were so beautiful,
and young and dynamic.

1411
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:19,498
There's a land of milk and honey

1412
01:32:19,665 --> 01:32:23,085
On the river they call the Nile

1413
01:32:23,252 --> 01:32:25,754
You know this phrase
"unapologetically Black"?

1414
01:32:25,921 --> 01:32:28,674
They lived that phrase every day.

1415
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:33,554
The African woman always worked
to bring home the bread.

1416
01:32:33,804 --> 01:32:35,806
You do whatever is necessary.

1417
01:32:35,973 --> 01:32:38,433
Oh, beautiful, wonderful Africa

1418
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,602
Someday I'm coming

1419
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:44,940
I'm coming for to see the promised land

1420
01:32:45,107 --> 01:32:47,484
I'll stop in

1421
01:32:47,651 --> 01:32:50,696
My dad and Abbey just didn't see
the civil rights struggle...

1422
01:32:50,863 --> 01:32:53,073
as an American thing.

1423
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,825
They saw the struggles in the Caribbean...

1424
01:32:54,992 --> 01:32:56,869
and South America and in Africa...

1425
01:32:57,202 --> 01:32:59,288
all as part of a common struggle.

1426
01:32:59,997 --> 01:33:03,375
South Africa. The problems that face
Black people everywhere...

1427
01:33:03,542 --> 01:33:07,963
are essentially the same, oppressed
by racist institutions created by whites.

1428
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:10,465
You guys can use certain kinds of support.

1429
01:33:10,632 --> 01:33:13,135
We do have to launch an armed struggle.

1430
01:33:13,302 --> 01:33:15,929
From the African continent
to the heart of Harlem...

1431
01:33:16,096 --> 01:33:18,724
Hugh Masekela, doing his thing.

1432
01:33:28,358 --> 01:33:32,362
In Harlem,
we were being exposed to linkages...

1433
01:33:32,529 --> 01:33:36,074
between Latinos, Blackness, Africa.

1434
01:33:36,241 --> 01:33:40,078
And Hugh Masekela brings that together.

1435
01:33:42,581 --> 01:33:46,543
When my dad left South Africa,
it was during the height of apartheid,

1436
01:33:46,793 --> 01:33:48,212
and he's literally escaping apartheid.

1437
01:33:54,718 --> 01:34:00,140
He comes to America and lands straight
into the hotbed of civil rights.

1438
01:34:06,313 --> 01:34:10,526
At the time, Grazing in the Grass was
one of the biggest songs on the planet.

1439
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:12,819
My father realized
there was this real hunger...

1440
01:34:12,986 --> 01:34:15,864
for Black Americans
to feel and see and taste

1441
01:34:15,948 --> 01:34:18,825
what it would be like to be African.

1442
01:34:27,918 --> 01:34:31,588
My father loved Harlem.
He always wanted to be within the people.

1443
01:34:31,922 --> 01:34:34,424
If it was poppin' off somewhere
where people were...

1444
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:37,511
disenfranchised, disempowered,
or needed support...

1445
01:34:37,678 --> 01:34:39,137
it was like a tractor beam for him.

1446
01:34:39,304 --> 01:34:42,224
Like, he had to go and be part of it.

1447
01:35:00,367 --> 01:35:01,410
In general...

1448
01:35:01,577 --> 01:35:04,830
you'll find that musicians come from
the activist part of their populations...

1449
01:35:04,997 --> 01:35:08,750
and they come
usually from the poor side of town...

1450
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:12,880
or represent the opinions of the people
who are exploited.

1451
01:35:13,046 --> 01:35:17,467
An artist's duty, as far as I'm concerned,
is to reflect the times.

1452
01:35:17,634 --> 01:35:21,763
And at this crucial time in our lives,
when everything is so desperate...

1453
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:25,309
when every day is a matter of survival,
I don't think you have a choice.

1454
01:35:25,475 --> 01:35:27,936
How can you be an artist
and not reflect the times?

1455
01:35:28,103 --> 01:35:29,354
Ladies and gentlemen...

1456
01:35:29,521 --> 01:35:32,399
we would like to introduce a young lady...

1457
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:37,070
who tells the story about the troubles
and tribulations of the ghetto.

1458
01:35:37,613 --> 01:35:41,200
The new Black struggle,
the first lady of soul...

1459
01:35:41,366 --> 01:35:42,743
Nina Simone.

1460
01:35:51,293 --> 01:35:53,128
We walked on water to see Nina Simone.

1461
01:35:56,215 --> 01:35:58,217
She looked like a African princess.

1462
01:35:59,551 --> 01:36:02,554
She would bang those piano keys.

1463
01:36:06,767 --> 01:36:10,145
Her fearlessness,
and her control as a woman...

1464
01:36:10,312 --> 01:36:12,981
as a Black woman, was just awesome.

1465
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:14,650
She was sending a message.

1466
01:36:19,821 --> 01:36:23,242
Mr. Backlash, Mr. Backlash

1467
01:36:23,408 --> 01:36:25,494
Who do you think I am?

1468
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:28,956
You raise my taxes and freeze my wages

1469
01:36:29,122 --> 01:36:31,959
Send my only son to Vietnam

1470
01:36:32,876 --> 01:36:38,674
You give me second-class houses
Second-class schools

1471
01:36:38,841 --> 01:36:43,512
I know you think that all colored people
Are just second-class fools

1472
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,931
Mr. Backlash

1473
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:51,103
I'm gonna leave you with the blues
Yes, I am

1474
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:54,648
Yes, I am
Yes, I am

1475
01:36:55,232 --> 01:36:59,570
When I try to find a job

1476
01:36:59,736 --> 01:37:02,573
To earn a little cash

1477
01:37:02,739 --> 01:37:07,244
All you got to offer
Is your mean, old white backlash

1478
01:37:07,411 --> 01:37:09,997
But the world is big

1479
01:37:11,123 --> 01:37:13,834
Big and bright and round

1480
01:37:14,459 --> 01:37:20,048
It's full of other folks like me
Who are Black, yellow, beige and brown

1481
01:37:20,215 --> 01:37:22,968
Mr. Backlash

1482
01:37:23,135 --> 01:37:27,472
I'm gonna leave you with the blues
Yes, I am

1483
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:29,558
Yes, I am

1484
01:37:32,394 --> 01:37:34,354
Hey, now

1485
01:37:39,526 --> 01:37:40,944
Yeah

1486
01:37:46,825 --> 01:37:50,829
Nina Simone was filtering
what was going on in this country...

1487
01:37:50,996 --> 01:37:54,791
through her experience as a Black woman.

1488
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:58,128
She knew what barriers she was breaking...

1489
01:37:58,295 --> 01:38:00,380
and threw them back in people's faces.

1490
01:38:08,388 --> 01:38:11,058
When Langston Hughes died

1491
01:38:11,558 --> 01:38:13,602
He told me many years before

1492
01:38:13,769 --> 01:38:17,731
He said
"Nina, keep on workin'

1493
01:38:17,898 --> 01:38:19,983
"Till they open up the door

1494
01:38:20,150 --> 01:38:22,861
"One of these days when they open the door

1495
01:38:23,028 --> 01:38:26,114
"And it's, you know it's open wide

1496
01:38:26,281 --> 01:38:29,034
"Make sure you sock it to 'em
where they live

1497
01:38:29,201 --> 01:38:31,703
"So they'll have no place to hide"

1498
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:33,664
So I'm tellin' you

1499
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:38,293
Yeah, I got to do it in the hot sun

1500
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:42,005
But, if necessary, got to do it

1501
01:38:42,923 --> 01:38:44,800
Yeah

1502
01:38:44,967 --> 01:38:46,927
Oh, God

1503
01:38:47,511 --> 01:38:51,431
I'm gonna leave you with the blues

1504
01:38:51,598 --> 01:38:54,726
Yes, I am
Yeah

1505
01:39:05,404 --> 01:39:07,322
Hello, hello, hello.

1506
01:39:08,323 --> 01:39:11,869
Remember Lorraine Hansberry
who wrote Raisin in the Sun?

1507
01:39:12,369 --> 01:39:13,871
-Huh?
-Yeah!

1508
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:16,081
Okay, there is an off-Broadway show...

1509
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:20,502
going on downtown right now
called To Be Young, Gifted and Black.

1510
01:39:20,669 --> 01:39:21,962
Some of you have seen it.

1511
01:39:22,129 --> 01:39:25,674
It is not a musical, as you know,
but we have taken...

1512
01:39:25,841 --> 01:39:28,302
Weldon Irvine,
who is my musical director...

1513
01:39:28,468 --> 01:39:32,764
and I have taken the title
and come up with a song...

1514
01:39:32,931 --> 01:39:36,393
To Be Young, Gifted and Black.

1515
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:45,402
To be young, gifted and Black

1516
01:39:47,237 --> 01:39:53,160
Oh, what a lovely, precious dream

1517
01:39:54,703 --> 01:39:59,458
To be young, gifted and Black

1518
01:40:00,459 --> 01:40:06,757
Open your heart to what I mean

1519
01:40:07,716 --> 01:40:12,554
In the whole world you know

1520
01:40:13,514 --> 01:40:19,436
There's a million boys and girls

1521
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:25,234
Who are young, gifted and Black

1522
01:40:26,777 --> 01:40:28,987
And that's a fact

1523
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:33,116
Nina Simone gave us hope.

1524
01:40:33,283 --> 01:40:38,038
You are young, gifted and Black

1525
01:40:38,997 --> 01:40:43,418
We must begin to tell our young

1526
01:40:43,585 --> 01:40:45,003
"There's a world waiting for you.

1527
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:47,714
"The quest has just begun."

1528
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:50,551
There's a world waiting for you

1529
01:40:51,552 --> 01:40:56,974
Yours is the quest that's just begun

1530
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:58,392
In 1961...

1531
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:01,144
my high school classmate
Hamilton Holmes and I...

1532
01:41:01,311 --> 01:41:05,899
became the first two Black students
to desegregate the University of Georgia.

1533
01:41:06,066 --> 01:41:09,778
I wanted to be a journalist
and it had a school of journalism.

1534
01:41:09,945 --> 01:41:13,740
What are your plans now
as far as this quarter is concerned?

1535
01:41:13,907 --> 01:41:16,076
I'll have to think it over.

1536
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:19,204
Many white students didn't want us there.

1537
01:41:19,371 --> 01:41:22,332
Do you think there'd be any trouble
if a Negro entered the university?

1538
01:41:22,499 --> 01:41:24,751
Well, I do if they were gonna put her
in the dormitories.

1539
01:41:24,918 --> 01:41:26,336
How do you yourself feel?

1540
01:41:26,503 --> 01:41:28,881
Well, I wouldn't myself like it.

1541
01:41:29,214 --> 01:41:32,759
The second or third night I was on campus,
there was a riot.

1542
01:41:34,595 --> 01:41:37,723
Oh, how I long to know the truth

1543
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:40,934
They put me in a dormitory
on the first floor.

1544
01:41:41,101 --> 01:41:44,980
All of the girls in my dorm were housed
on the second floor...

1545
01:41:45,147 --> 01:41:48,483
and they used to take turns
beating on the floor...

1546
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:50,903
'cause they knew exactly
where my room was.

1547
01:41:51,403 --> 01:41:54,239
But I had Nina Simone's albums.

1548
01:41:54,406 --> 01:41:57,743
So, while the girls were upstairs
beating on the floor...

1549
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:59,620
trying to make me uncomfortable...

1550
01:41:59,786 --> 01:42:02,372
I was listening to Nina Simone...

1551
01:42:02,539 --> 01:42:05,292
and just being very at peace.

1552
01:42:05,459 --> 01:42:10,214
To be young, gifted and Black

1553
01:42:11,507 --> 01:42:13,842
Is where it's at

1554
01:42:14,384 --> 01:42:16,595
Is where it's at

1555
01:42:17,221 --> 01:42:20,265
Is where it's at

1556
01:42:28,524 --> 01:42:31,401
Nina Simone sung that in her tone...

1557
01:42:31,568 --> 01:42:35,072
that is somewhere
between hope and mourning.

1558
01:42:35,239 --> 01:42:39,785
I mean, nobody could capture both spirits
like Nina.

1559
01:42:39,952 --> 01:42:41,870
It defined a whole generation...

1560
01:42:42,037 --> 01:42:44,706
because you could hear in her voice...

1561
01:42:44,873 --> 01:42:47,876
our pain, but our defiance.

1562
01:42:48,252 --> 01:42:49,294
Okay.

1563
01:42:49,545 --> 01:42:52,673
Okay. Hold it. Hold it.
This is for you.

1564
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:56,510
It is written by David Nelson.
He's not here today.

1565
01:42:56,677 --> 01:43:00,222
There are three Black poets, or six,
or maybe a hundred in this town.

1566
01:43:00,389 --> 01:43:03,600
But he's not here and I didn't
memorize it enough so I have to read it.

1567
01:43:03,767 --> 01:43:05,018
It's for you.

1568
01:43:05,811 --> 01:43:08,313
Are you ready, Black people?

1569
01:43:08,438 --> 01:43:09,982
Yeah!

1570
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:11,650
Are you ready?

1571
01:43:11,817 --> 01:43:13,402
-Are you really ready?
-Yeah!

1572
01:43:15,028 --> 01:43:16,029
Are you ready?

1573
01:43:16,113 --> 01:43:19,283
Ready to do what is necessary?

1574
01:43:19,449 --> 01:43:20,450
Are you ready?

1575
01:43:20,617 --> 01:43:22,536
Are you ready, Black man?

1576
01:43:23,412 --> 01:43:25,789
-Are you ready?
-Black woman, are you ready?

1577
01:43:25,956 --> 01:43:27,457
-Are you ready, ready, ready?
-Yeah!

1578
01:43:27,624 --> 01:43:28,834
Are you ready?

1579
01:43:29,001 --> 01:43:30,836
Hear me good now, hear me good now

1580
01:43:31,003 --> 01:43:32,838
-Hear me good now
-Are you ready?

1581
01:43:33,005 --> 01:43:36,175
-Are you ready to kill if necessary?
-Yeah!

1582
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:37,342
Are you ready?

1583
01:43:37,509 --> 01:43:40,262
-Is your mind ready?
-Yeah!

1584
01:43:40,387 --> 01:43:42,181
Is your body ready?

1585
01:43:42,264 --> 01:43:44,057
Yeah!

1586
01:43:44,641 --> 01:43:45,684
Are you ready?

1587
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:48,812
Are you ready to smash white things?

1588
01:43:48,979 --> 01:43:51,940
-Are you ready?
-Yeah!

1589
01:43:52,357 --> 01:43:54,276
-To burn buildings, are you ready?
-Yeah.

1590
01:43:54,443 --> 01:43:57,821
On one side of 125th Street,
an angry crowd of young people.

1591
01:43:57,988 --> 01:44:00,699
Across the street,
plans for a state office building.

1592
01:44:00,866 --> 01:44:03,702
This whole section of town here
will be destroyed...

1593
01:44:03,869 --> 01:44:05,454
if a school don't go out there.

1594
01:44:05,621 --> 01:44:07,789
They got plenty land downtown
to build a state building.

1595
01:44:07,956 --> 01:44:09,124
Why they come up here and pick Harlem...

1596
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:11,418
where all the colored people
and the Puerto Ricans are?

1597
01:44:11,585 --> 01:44:12,586
Black everybody

1598
01:44:12,669 --> 01:44:15,672
Are you really, really, really ready?

1599
01:44:17,799 --> 01:44:20,844
Are you ready to listen
to all the beautiful Black voices?

1600
01:44:21,011 --> 01:44:22,721
The beautiful Black feeling?

1601
01:44:22,888 --> 01:44:26,016
The beautiful Black waves
moving in beautiful air?

1602
01:44:26,183 --> 01:44:27,851
Are you ready to love Black?

1603
01:44:28,018 --> 01:44:29,311
Always loving Black?

1604
01:44:29,478 --> 01:44:32,272
Are you ready, Black people?
Are you ready?

1605
01:44:34,775 --> 01:44:35,984
Are you ready?

1606
01:44:36,151 --> 01:44:38,320
Are you ready to change?

1607
01:44:38,487 --> 01:44:42,449
Into a groovy, groovy Black person?

1608
01:44:42,616 --> 01:44:45,160
Are you really ready to change yourself?

1609
01:44:45,327 --> 01:44:48,497
Turn yourself inside out
Through and through

1610
01:44:48,664 --> 01:44:52,668
And make yourself a through and through
and through and through

1611
01:44:52,835 --> 01:44:56,380
And through and through and through

1612
01:44:56,547 --> 01:44:58,173
Real Black person?

1613
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:00,843
I say, are you ready?

1614
01:45:04,513 --> 01:45:06,181
Ladies and gentlemen...

1615
01:45:06,348 --> 01:45:08,517
brothers and sisters...

1616
01:45:08,684 --> 01:45:11,228
Nina Simone.

1617
01:45:11,812 --> 01:45:13,313
Are you ready?

1618
01:45:14,022 --> 01:45:15,607
That concert...

1619
01:45:15,774 --> 01:45:19,736
was like a rose comin' through cement.

1620
01:45:20,529 --> 01:45:22,114
It was a good thing for Harlem...

1621
01:45:22,281 --> 01:45:25,784
because as much as Harlem
has been maligned over the years...

1622
01:45:25,951 --> 01:45:27,494
for the crime and the drugs...

1623
01:45:27,661 --> 01:45:29,621
there was a bunch of folk...

1624
01:45:29,788 --> 01:45:34,626
law-abiding, productive citizens, never
used drugs, went to work every day...

1625
01:45:34,793 --> 01:45:39,298
took care of business,
very community-oriented and loved Harlem.

1626
01:45:39,464 --> 01:45:42,092
Loved where they lived,
loved their community.

1627
01:45:44,761 --> 01:45:47,556
It was like nothing I'd ever felt before
in my life.

1628
01:45:48,307 --> 01:45:52,060
Before that,
the world was like black and white.

1629
01:45:52,227 --> 01:45:54,980
The concert took my life into color.

1630
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:04,489
But then, the festival was forgotten.

1631
01:46:16,335 --> 01:46:19,838
It did not register to me
until we were leaving...

1632
01:46:20,214 --> 01:46:22,925
when we realized the magnitude of it.

1633
01:46:23,342 --> 01:46:25,385
But I never turned around and looked.

1634
01:46:29,598 --> 01:46:33,101
Even though the shows were recorded
all summer...

1635
01:46:33,268 --> 01:46:37,606
it feels like it happened
and then they threw it away.

1636
01:46:40,776 --> 01:46:44,238
I shot the festival, tried to sell it.

1637
01:46:44,404 --> 01:46:46,323
Woodstock was the same year...

1638
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:49,952
and Woodstock got all of the publicity.

1639
01:46:50,118 --> 01:46:53,580
So, in selling it,
I started to call it the Black Woodstock.

1640
01:46:54,122 --> 01:46:55,499
It didn't help.

1641
01:46:55,958 --> 01:46:58,168
Nobody was interested in a Black show.

1642
01:46:58,335 --> 01:46:59,628
Nobody.

1643
01:47:00,546 --> 01:47:03,090
Nobody cared about Harlem.

1644
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:08,762
As we all know,
this has happened to Black people.

1645
01:47:08,929 --> 01:47:10,472
A lot of our history is forgotten.

1646
01:47:10,848 --> 01:47:14,101
I mean, it's not like that festival
is an anomaly.

1647
01:47:14,768 --> 01:47:20,440
We hold these truths to be self-evident
that Black history is gonna be erased.

1648
01:47:21,817 --> 01:47:24,945
The so-called powers that are or were...

1649
01:47:25,112 --> 01:47:30,200
didn't find it significant enough
to keep it as a part of history.

1650
01:47:30,367 --> 01:47:32,661
Because it is a part of history.

1651
01:47:33,996 --> 01:47:38,333
We were comin' together
to say this was our world.

1652
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:40,377
The Black world.

1653
01:47:40,544 --> 01:47:42,337
This is ours.

1654
01:47:44,506 --> 01:47:46,216
We, as a people...

1655
01:47:46,383 --> 01:47:48,343
especially today...

1656
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:52,264
need to feel like family.

1657
01:47:52,931 --> 01:47:55,058
Holdin' up for each other...

1658
01:47:55,225 --> 01:47:57,102
fighting for each other...

1659
01:47:57,269 --> 01:47:59,396
liftin' each other up.

1660
01:47:59,563 --> 01:48:01,773
We're gonna try to sing a song together
if we can.

1661
01:48:03,901 --> 01:48:05,652
Now, the song is called Higher.

1662
01:48:07,404 --> 01:48:10,282
We'd like to ask everybody to join in.

1663
01:48:10,449 --> 01:48:13,035
Don't wait for approval
from your neighbor...

1664
01:48:13,202 --> 01:48:15,037
'cause your neighbor
might be waiting for you.

1665
01:48:15,913 --> 01:48:17,581
Now, it goes like this.

1666
01:48:18,749 --> 01:48:22,002
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1667
01:48:25,464 --> 01:48:28,592
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1668
01:48:32,262 --> 01:48:34,806
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1669
01:48:34,973 --> 01:48:36,433
-Higher
-Higher

1670
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,310
-Higher
-Higher

1671
01:48:38,477 --> 01:48:40,896
Higher, yeah, yeah

1672
01:48:44,608 --> 01:48:46,985
Hey, now

1673
01:48:53,283 --> 01:48:56,203
Hey
Take you higher

1674
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:59,248
Hey
Hey, hey

1675
01:49:11,385 --> 01:49:14,429
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1676
01:49:14,596 --> 01:49:17,975
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1677
01:49:18,141 --> 01:49:20,060
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1678
01:49:21,103 --> 01:49:24,147
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1679
01:49:24,314 --> 01:49:27,484
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1680
01:49:27,651 --> 01:49:30,737
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1681
01:49:30,904 --> 01:49:33,949
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1682
01:49:34,116 --> 01:49:37,035
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1683
01:49:37,411 --> 01:49:39,663
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1684
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:41,248
-Higher
-Higher

1685
01:49:41,415 --> 01:49:43,584
-Higher
-Higher

1686
01:49:46,128 --> 01:49:47,838
Higher

1687
01:49:48,797 --> 01:49:50,632
Yeah

1688
01:49:57,055 --> 01:49:58,599
Feel it take over

1689
01:50:00,225 --> 01:50:01,894
Feel it take over

1690
01:50:02,936 --> 01:50:05,939
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1691
01:50:06,106 --> 01:50:09,109
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1692
01:50:09,276 --> 01:50:12,404
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1693
01:50:12,571 --> 01:50:15,741
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1694
01:50:15,949 --> 01:50:18,285
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1695
01:50:19,077 --> 01:50:21,747
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1696
01:50:22,372 --> 01:50:25,292
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1697
01:50:25,501 --> 01:50:28,629
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1698
01:50:28,837 --> 01:50:31,840
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1699
01:50:32,049 --> 01:50:34,635
-Wanna take you higher
-Higher

1700
01:50:36,887 --> 01:50:38,138
Higher

1701
01:50:40,057 --> 01:50:41,183
Higher

1702
01:50:43,268 --> 01:50:44,561
Higher

1703
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:52,736
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sly and the Family Stone.

1704
01:50:52,903 --> 01:50:54,363
Yeah.

1705
01:50:59,952 --> 01:51:01,119
I'm sorry.

1706
01:51:05,082 --> 01:51:06,667
It's like...

1707
01:51:08,919 --> 01:51:10,295
You know, it's funny.

1708
01:51:11,046 --> 01:51:13,131
You put memories away...

1709
01:51:13,924 --> 01:51:15,634
and you don't realize...

1710
01:51:16,009 --> 01:51:17,469
Sometimes you don't even know
if they're real.

1711
01:51:18,679 --> 01:51:24,017
So, it's almost confirmation
that what I knew is real.

1712
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,061
Yeah, so,
you know you're not crazy, like...

1713
01:51:26,228 --> 01:51:27,896
I'm not crazy!

1714
01:51:28,689 --> 01:51:30,399
Thank you!

1715
01:51:30,566 --> 01:51:33,318
So, watching you watch this...

1716
01:51:34,111 --> 01:51:35,779
is making me overwhelmed now.

1717
01:51:35,946 --> 01:51:36,989
I thought I was the only person that...

1718
01:51:37,155 --> 01:51:41,410
I knew I wasn't crazy, brother,
I knew I was not crazy.

1719
01:51:41,577 --> 01:51:43,996
But now I know I'm not.

1720
01:51:44,162 --> 01:51:46,665
And this is just confirmation.

1721
01:51:47,416 --> 01:51:50,127
And not only that...

1722
01:51:51,795 --> 01:51:56,175
how beautiful it was.

1723
01:51:58,927 --> 01:52:03,098
Have a little faith

1724
01:52:03,265 --> 01:52:07,019
In the one you love, yeah

1725
01:52:07,186 --> 01:52:10,522
Have a little faith

1726
01:52:10,689 --> 01:52:15,485
In the one you love

1727
01:52:17,321 --> 01:52:19,489
Nights are cold

1728
01:52:21,241 --> 01:52:23,744
And the days are so long, yeah

1729
01:52:23,911 --> 01:52:25,495
Yeah

1730
01:52:25,662 --> 01:52:28,540
And though I thought I had a little woman

1731
01:52:29,875 --> 01:52:33,128
That I could call my very own, yeah

1732
01:52:34,296 --> 01:52:36,757
But some of her friends

1733
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:42,262
Told her bad things about me, yeah

1734
01:52:42,763 --> 01:52:45,724
And I tried to tell that little woman

1735
01:52:47,059 --> 01:52:48,894
To believe in me

1736
01:52:49,061 --> 01:52:53,398
I told her, have a little faith

1737
01:52:53,565 --> 01:52:56,818
In the one you love

1738
01:52:56,985 --> 01:52:58,320
Keep the faith, baby

1739
01:52:58,487 --> 01:53:01,782
Have a little faith

1740
01:53:01,949 --> 01:53:06,453
In the one you love

1741
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:10,082
You know, I went to her house

1742
01:53:12,584 --> 01:53:16,046
On a Sunday afternoon, yeah

1743
01:53:16,338 --> 01:53:20,008
I took one look in that woman's face

1744
01:53:20,175 --> 01:53:22,719
And don't you know, everything was gloom

1745
01:53:22,928 --> 01:53:24,596
Yeah

1746
01:53:24,763 --> 01:53:26,974
She said she had a call

1747
01:53:28,767 --> 01:53:32,104
From someone she knew, hey

1748
01:53:33,146 --> 01:53:36,024
They told her bad things about me

1749
01:53:36,525 --> 01:53:38,652
Things I knew just couldn't be true

1750
01:53:38,819 --> 01:53:43,448
I told her to have a little faith
Oh, Lord

1751
01:53:43,615 --> 01:53:46,660
In the one you love

1752
01:53:46,827 --> 01:53:48,495
Keep the faith, keep the faith

1753
01:53:48,662 --> 01:53:51,915
Have a little faith

1754
01:53:52,082 --> 01:53:55,836
In the one you love

1755
01:53:59,715 --> 01:54:01,216
Oh, Lord

1756
01:54:04,428 --> 01:54:08,640
I don't ever wanna see
A tear fallin' from your eyes

1757
01:54:12,728 --> 01:54:16,607
Honey, I love ya and you know I need ya

1758
01:54:19,902 --> 01:54:25,532
I want you always here by my side
Oh, Lord

1759
01:54:28,202 --> 01:54:30,078
Say it again
Oh, Lord

1760
01:54:30,245 --> 01:54:33,457
Have a little faith

1761
01:54:33,624 --> 01:54:37,794
In the one you love

1762
01:54:38,253 --> 01:54:41,465
Have a little faith

1763
01:54:41,632 --> 01:54:44,510
In the one you love

1764
01:54:44,676 --> 01:54:46,220
Say it again

1765
01:54:46,386 --> 01:54:49,598
Have a little faith

1766
01:54:49,765 --> 01:54:52,434
In the one you love

1767
01:54:52,601 --> 01:54:54,144
Say it again

1768
01:54:54,311 --> 01:54:57,022
Have a little faith

1769
01:54:57,606 --> 01:55:02,611
In the one you love

1770
01:56:57,893 --> 01:56:59,686
Y'all be cool for a minute.

1771
01:57:03,065 --> 01:57:04,691
Hey.

1772
01:57:04,858 --> 01:57:06,151
What are you doing?

1773
01:57:07,444 --> 01:57:10,405
Fellas, silence.

1774
01:57:11,782 --> 01:57:13,116
You done?

1775
01:57:15,369 --> 01:57:16,495
Hey, dig.

1776
01:57:18,372 --> 01:57:20,791
Stevie, I mean, the rain on my clothes
is bad enough...

1777
01:57:20,958 --> 01:57:23,669
but you got your hands on my clothes,
you dig it?

1778
01:57:24,169 --> 01:57:26,171
Why you gotta cross me
in front of these people?

1779
01:57:26,338 --> 01:57:28,423
Hey, man,
take your hands off my clothes.

1780
01:57:29,550 --> 01:57:31,176
Man, take your hands off 'em.

1781
01:57:31,343 --> 01:57:33,720
What you mean, your clothes? I bought 'em.

1782
01:57:34,221 --> 01:57:35,389
You ain't bought 'em.

1783
01:57:37,057 --> 01:57:38,225
I'm goin' now.
