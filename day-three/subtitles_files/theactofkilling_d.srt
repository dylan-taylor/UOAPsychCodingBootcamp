1
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:30,791
<i>Peace! Happiness! Smile!</i>

2
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:35,838
<i>1, 234!
Smile! More teeth!</i>

3
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:41,760
<i>Don't let the camera
catch you looking bad!</i>

4
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:47,557
<i>Smile! 1, 2, 3, 4!</i>

5
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:50,852
<i>Real joy, not just pleasure!</i>

6
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:57,776
<i>And natural beauty!
This isn’t fake!</i>

7
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:02,989
<i>Okay, peace! Peace! Peace!</i>

8
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:20,706
I'm looking for an actress...

9
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:23,751
...an actress to play a mother.

10
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,045
Old ladies like you...

11
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:29,548
When you see
movie stars on TV-

12
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:33,510
- you must dream of becoming one.

13
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:36,889
- No, I don't.
- Why not?

14
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:40,184
- You have nothing else to do.
- No, I'm busy.

15
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:47,024
These women won't agree
to play communists like this.

16
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:54,406
It might work if we
invite them to your house first...

17
00:04:54,614 --> 00:04:58,201
But if we ask them right here,
they'll be afraid.

18
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,830
People might think
they really are communists.

19
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:07,043
I disagree... In my neighborhood
everybody would do it.

20
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:10,463
Then let's go there instead.
It's impossible here.

21
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:14,801
This whole area was communist.

22
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:22,850
We're looking for
women with children -

23
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:27,271
-to play communist wives.

24
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:32,568
You try to prevent us
from burning down your house.

25
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:35,154
But in the end
we burn it down.

26
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:40,367
'Mother, they burned
our house down!'

27
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,419
Like that.

28
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:55,048
And don't worry if you touch
her breasts. You're still a kid.

29
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:57,426
Ready?

30
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,806
Kill them!

31
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:04,849
No!

32
00:06:05,058 --> 00:06:09,604
- Destroy their house!
- No, please don't!

33
00:06:11,064 --> 00:06:14,692
Burn it!

34
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:16,236
Kill!

35
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:21,324
Cry! Weep!

36
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:24,452
Don't burn my house.

37
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,333
Keep crying!

38
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,294
Okay cut, cut!

39
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:46,015
Whether this ends up
on the big screen -

40
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:52,187
- or only on TV
it doesn't matter.

41
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:57,442
- But we have to show...
- That this is the history!

42
00:06:57,693 --> 00:07:01,613
This is who we are!

43
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:05,325
So in the future
people will remember!

44
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:08,995
It doesn't have to be a big film -

45
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:15,376
- like Rank Organization,
Paramount Pictures, MGM...

46
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:22,884
We, in our simple way
step by step -

47
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:27,346
- will tell the story-

48
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:32,226
- of what we did
when we were young!

49
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:37,606
Excuse me...

50
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:50,035
There's many ghosts here, because
many people were killed here.

51
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:54,498
- They died unnatural deaths.
- Unnatural deaths.

52
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:57,417
They arrived perfectly healthy.

53
00:07:57,626 --> 00:08:01,588
When they got here
they were beaten up... and died.

54
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:07,844
At first, we beat them to death...
But there was too much blood.

55
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:12,515
There was so much blood here...

56
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:19,481
So when we cleaned it up,
it smelled awful.

57
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:25,278
To avoid the blood,
I used this system.

58
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:28,656
Can I show you?

59
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:38,457
Sit there.

60
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:42,211
Face that way.

61
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,631
We have to re-enact this properly.

62
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:53,931
This is how to do it -

63
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:59,228
- without too much blood.

64
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:08,904
I've tried to forget all this
with good music... Dancing...

65
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,698
Feeling happy..

66
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:15,618
A little alcohol...

67
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:18,955
A little marijuana...

68
00:09:19,164 --> 00:09:23,960
A little... what do you call it?
Ecstasy..

69
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:29,132
Once I'd get drunk,
I'd 'fly' and feel happy.

70
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,135
Cha cha.

71
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:52,738
He's a happy man.

72
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:27,438
Anwar Congo,
from the paramilitary group.

73
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:31,734
You've heard of him?
From the Medan Cinema.

74
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:36,614
Now that I'm governor,
I stab him if he threatens me.

75
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:46,040
Everyone was scared of him.

76
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:47,917
The only one not scared was me-

77
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,921
- because he looked after me
when I was a kid.

78
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:55,924
When I was in high school -

79
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:59,344
- I was the only one
not scared of him -

80
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:04,266
- because I didn't think of him
as a big gangster.

81
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:07,936
But when people heard his name,
they'd be terrified.

82
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:12,649
- Why?
- Because he's one of the killers.

83
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:17,571
Now, the communists' children
are starting to speak out -

84
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:21,366
- trying to reverse the history.

85
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:26,079
One of them wrote, 'I’m Proud to be
the Child of a Communist.'

86
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:29,374
But this won't last long -

87
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,168
- because the people won't accept it.

88
00:11:32,377 --> 00:11:35,963
Communism will never be
accepted here, because -

89
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:42,845
- we have so many gangsters,
and that's a good thing.

90
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:48,225
The word 'gangster' comes
from English. 'Free men'.

91
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:52,438
Thugs want freedom to do things,
even if they're wrong...

92
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:57,318
But if we know
how to work with them -

93
00:11:57,526 --> 00:12:00,988
- all we have to do is direct them.

94
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:19,422
We were gangsters.
We didn't have real jobs.

95
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:26,596
So we'd do anything for money..

96
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:30,517
...just to buy nice clothes.

97
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,853
This was the cinema -

98
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,856
- where I worked.

99
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:41,986
I'd stand here,
scalping tickets and showing off.

100
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:45,656
When films were popular,
we'd scalp tickets.

101
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:52,455
But when the communists
were strong -

102
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:58,836
- they demanded
a ban on American films.

103
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:05,092
They wanted fewer
American films.

104
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:11,640
- So we gangsters made less money.
- Because there was no audience.

105
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:16,269
Hollywood films were popular.

106
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:21,566
Without them the gangsters
didn't make as much money.

107
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:25,737
As we say:
'Dinner missed the belly'

108
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:33,077
When we'd watch happy movies,
like Elvis movies -

109
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:39,459
- we'd leave the cinema smiling,
dancing to the music.

110
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:43,546
Our hands...

111
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:49,468
Still dancing...

112
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:52,596
Still in the mood of the film...

113
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:58,853
if girls passed,
we'd whistle.

114
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:03,983
We loved it.
We didn't care what people thought.

115
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:10,906
Here was the paramilitary office,
where I always killed people.

116
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:15,744
I'd see the guy
being interrogated...

117
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:21,208
I'd give him a cigarette.
I'd still be dancing, laughing...

118
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:26,463
it was like we were killing...

119
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:28,548
...happily!

120
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:55,866
When my mom was alive -

121
00:14:56,075 --> 00:15:02,623
- sometimes,
when I was screaming...

122
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:09,505
...my mom would rush in
and wake me up.

123
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:13,092
'Before you sleep, wash your feet!'

124
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:18,055
'Pray properly Don't just sleep.'

125
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:26,897
I know my bad dreams
come from what I did...

126
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:31,943
...killing people
who didn't want to die.

127
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,195
I forced them to die.

128
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:44,789
<i>Why are you daydreaming,
my love?</i>

129
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:50,128
<i>Are you so uncertain?</i>

130
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:11,774
You're a star now!

131
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,027
Amazing!

132
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,196
This guy's a star!

133
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:23,660
Joshua, film the photos!

134
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:28,832
That's the president's father-in-law,
Sarwo Edhie.

135
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,253
- I'll introduce them one-by-one.
- That’s the president.

136
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,215
That's him with the president.

137
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:43,972
Ibrahim Sinik is famous
all across the country!

138
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:50,436
We gangsters keep him
well protected.

139
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:53,648
We wish him
a long, prosperous life.

140
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:56,526
But don't forget
to share your money!

141
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:59,111
Ask Joshua for money.

142
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,906
After all, he’s from London!

143
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:05,743
You interrogated communists
in your newsroom?

144
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:09,997
He was always
gathering information.

145
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:15,002
When he had the information -

146
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:20,466
- he'd say: 'Guilty!' and we'd
take them away and kill them.

147
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,555
When you interrogated
communists in your office -

148
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:30,684
- what questions did you ask?

149
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:34,437
Whatever we asked,
we'd change their answers -

150
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:37,399
- to make them look bad.

151
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:40,443
As a newspaper man -

152
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:46,658
- my job was to make
the public hate them.

153
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:50,536
And your relationship
with the army?

154
00:17:50,745 --> 00:17:54,374
- The army.
- We had no formal relationship.

155
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,169
But after we captured
the communist youth -

156
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:01,672
- and beat them to a pulp -

157
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:05,259
- we gave them to the army
but the army wouldn't take them.

158
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:09,096
They said,
'Just dump them in the river.'

159
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:13,726
Do you remember
exactly what the army said?

160
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,812
I didn't bring the victims.
I had men for that.

161
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:21,150
Why would I do such grunt work?
Why would I kill people?

162
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:25,654
I didn't have to! One wink from me
and they're dead!

163
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:08,571
Pancasila Youth!

164
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:23,419
How you doing, Anwar?

165
00:19:24,086 --> 00:19:27,131
This is the real Anwar Congo!

166
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:39,893
<i>Pancasila Youth,
servants of the nation...</i>

167
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,271
<i>Once our sails go up</i> -

168
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,276
- <i>we never turn back!</i>

169
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:08,045
- Pancasila!
- Forever!

170
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:18,889
All Pancasila Youth members
are heroes.

171
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:21,725
From exterminating
the communists -

172
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:26,772
- to fighting neo-communists
and left-wing extremists-

173
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,946
- and those who want
to destroy our country..

174
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:37,157
This isn't only the duty
of the army and police.

175
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:41,912
We, Pancasila Youth,
must take a stand.

176
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,668
These are threats to the nation,
and we must take action.

177
00:20:50,337 --> 00:20:55,216
They say Pancasila Youth
is a gangster organization.

178
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:57,635
If we're gangsters-

179
00:20:57,844 --> 00:21:01,472
- I'm the biggest
gangster of all.

180
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:08,396
Oh, shit!

181
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:17,113
How did Pancasila Youth
exterminate the communists?

182
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:19,407
We killed them all.

183
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:22,993
That's what happened.

184
00:21:23,953 --> 00:21:26,747
May I hit the ball now?

185
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,885
<i>We have too much democracy
it's chaos.</i>

186
00:21:40,093 --> 00:21:43,346
<i>What is this 'democracy'?</i>

187
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:47,851
<i>Things were better under
the military dictatorship.</i>

188
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:51,104
<i>Better economy More security .</i>

189
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:55,775
<i>Gangsters are free men.</i>

190
00:21:55,984 --> 00:22:01,698
<i>They want to enjoy, life
in their style.</i>

191
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,160
<i>Relax and Rolex.</i>

192
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:14,085
You definitely have a mole
on your pussy.

193
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:17,463
Definitely.

194
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:26,847
That was great.

195
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:36,148
If I get a strike,
I get a massage!

196
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:59,462
<i>There must be many ghosts here.</i>

197
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:02,715
<i>They arrived perfectly healthy.</i>

198
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,635
<i>Then they were beaten up.</i>

199
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,971
<i>And died.</i>

200
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,891
<i>Sit here.</i>

201
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,773
<i>We have to re-enact this properly</i>

202
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:34,580
I never would have
worn white pants.

203
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,292
I never wore white.

204
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,712
I always wore dark colors.

205
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,633
I look like I'm dressed for a picnic.

206
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,475
My acting has to be violent.

207
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:04,609
And maybe I should dye
my hair black.

208
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:09,280
<i>And now he's dead.</i>

209
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:15,953
But how do you feel
watching this?

210
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:21,876
How do I feel?
Back then I felt more free.

211
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:28,799
Older men are gentle,
but young men...

212
00:24:29,008 --> 00:24:33,804
Especially me, because I watched
so many sadistic movies.

213
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:38,434
We were influenced by them.
So we...

214
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,273
We were more cruel
than the movies.

215
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:51,947
I know a good location
for a torture scene.

216
00:24:52,155 --> 00:25:00,121
Behind the school,
in the old toilets...

217
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:05,210
- But the neighbors will hear..
- They know me.

218
00:25:05,418 --> 00:25:09,422
If I look at them,
they run away.

219
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:15,511
Look, I'm laughing.
I did it wrong, didn't I?

220
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,597
It's my mistake.

221
00:25:22,351 --> 00:25:27,023
<i>I was influenced</i>
by films starring -

222
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:31,694
- <i>Marlon Brando, Al Pacino...</i>

223
00:25:31,902 --> 00:25:39,910
<i>Those were my favorites.
And westerns with John Wayne.</i>

224
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:47,125
I brought these clothes
from home.

225
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:51,672
Hopefully they express my vision.

226
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:58,970
Hey you have to change your shirt.
Put on a white one.

227
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:06,019
You'll look lovely in this!
Perfect!

228
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:11,900
- What the fuck is this?
- Just a little decoration.

229
00:26:12,692 --> 00:26:16,404
It matches your body shape.

230
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:19,824
It's perfect!

231
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:25,413
- This one's for the 'Big Boss'.
- Yep. It's perfect for me.

232
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:33,254
And you know where I got
the inspiration for it?

233
00:26:33,462 --> 00:26:38,592
I always watched gangsterfilms -

234
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:42,972
- where they always kill with wire.

235
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,766
It's faster with wire.

236
00:26:45,974 --> 00:26:52,439
Because when you pull the wire
hard, the victim can't grab it...

237
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:57,277
He can't, because it cuts in...

238
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,097
it's great to be
a communist, huh?

239
00:27:26,305 --> 00:27:31,602
Don't just nod. Say 'Yes sir!'

240
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:37,817
- Wanna smoke, Pang?
- No.

241
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:44,865
Try this 'neo-colonialist' cigar.

242
00:27:45,074 --> 00:27:47,993
Have a puff.

243
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:52,498
Just stick it in your nose
if you don't want to smoke it.

244
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:55,751
- Look at him!
- Look at me.

245
00:27:55,918 --> 00:27:58,837
Look him in the eye!

246
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,531
Hold on, Joshua.
It's evening prayers.

247
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:35,122
- Don't tie the blindfold so tight.
- I didn't.

248
00:28:35,331 --> 00:28:38,959
The way I pull it
just looks tight.

249
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:43,839
Even by the window it's hot.

250
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:07,779
'Human rights!'

251
00:29:07,988 --> 00:29:14,244
All this talk about 'human rights'
pisses me off.

252
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:19,249
'We want a little human rights!'

253
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:23,795
Back then
there was no human rights.

254
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:28,216
- Because you made a revolution.
- That's no excuse.

255
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:34,347
For example, in Argentina
some generals launch a coup d'état-

256
00:29:34,514 --> 00:29:38,935
- and then they're convicted
of human rights violations.

257
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:44,482
But I'm a gangster

258
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:51,322
I'm a gangster A free man.

259
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,907
A movietheater gangster.

260
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:56,660
Not much education.

261
00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:01,582
- A human drop out.
- A drop out.

262
00:30:02,624 --> 00:30:08,171
There are people like me
everywhere in the world.

263
00:30:29,984 --> 00:30:32,403
They still look great.

264
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:39,535
There were many
Chinese communists!

265
00:30:39,744 --> 00:30:44,957
I got a thick book
with all their names.

266
00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:48,752
I'd visit them,
'How much you gonna pay?'

267
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:54,174
They'd say
'Please, Sir don't! I'm old.'

268
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:59,805
We used them for their money
We didn't kill them.

269
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:05,394
But if they didn't pay we killed
them. They can't have it both ways.

270
00:31:05,602 --> 00:31:09,106
If they didn't pay..

271
00:31:09,272 --> 00:31:11,942
...we killed them.

272
00:31:22,577 --> 00:31:27,874
These Chinese are diff cult.
Sometimes they piss me off.

273
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:38,301
That's it...
You sure speak good Chinese.

274
00:31:40,094 --> 00:31:45,308
When I need money
there's nothing like an old friend.

275
00:31:45,474 --> 00:31:50,271
With others, if it's not enough,
I won't accept it.

276
00:31:51,564 --> 00:31:57,152
Hi Lung. C'mon, shake my hand.
It's been a long time.

277
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:01,448
- I need money.
- Why me?

278
00:32:01,657 --> 00:32:05,828
I'm asking you nicely

279
00:32:05,994 --> 00:32:10,874
I don't even ask the others.
I just punch them...

280
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:14,252
An uppercut right in the stomach.

281
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:21,426
You give this sincerely?
Then thank you very much.

282
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:31,352
Our organization is planning
a big meeting. We need money.

283
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:35,356
We need more than normal.

284
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:40,028
We need a huge amount.

285
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:43,698
Don't give the usual amount.

286
00:32:44,157 --> 00:32:46,617
What’s this shit?

287
00:32:46,826 --> 00:32:49,120
Give more
or I won't accept it.

288
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:54,417
- Please...
- I'd never accept so little.

289
00:32:55,793 --> 00:32:57,837
Here.

290
00:32:58,045 --> 00:33:01,090
That's not enough.

291
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:04,051
What's wrong with you, Cik?

292
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:07,638
We consider you our father Cik.

293
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:13,477
So throw in more, and we'll take it,
because this isn’t for just anybody.

294
00:33:13,685 --> 00:33:17,898
Count it up and put it in.

295
00:33:35,206 --> 00:33:40,295
The spirit of Pancasila Youth -

296
00:33:40,503 --> 00:33:44,632
- which people accuse
of being gangsters...

297
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:49,554
Gangsters are people
who work outside the system -

298
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:53,849
- not for the government.

299
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:59,063
The word 'gangster'
comes from 'free men'.

300
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:03,275
This nation needs 'free men'!

301
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:10,157
If everyone worked for
the government-

302
00:34:10,365 --> 00:34:14,620
- we'd be a nation of bureaucrats.
We'd get nothing done.

303
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:18,165
We need gangsters
to get things done.

304
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:21,960
Free, private men
who get things done.

305
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,133
Use your muscles!

306
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:31,469
Muscles aren't
for beating people up -

307
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:36,808
- although beating people up
is sometimes needed.

308
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,730
- Once more, Pancasila!
- Forever!

309
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:45,525
- Pancasila!
- Freedom!

310
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:53,616
<i>While you wait for this train,
we wish to inform you -</i>

311
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:59,622
<i>- that the traffic laws are there
to protect you and your family.</i>

312
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:04,376
<i>We also inform you,
that in accordance with the law...</i>

313
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:13,218
- This is me, Anwar Congo.
- Oh, that's you!

314
00:35:13,385 --> 00:35:16,263
Look, I'm rolling a joint.

315
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,558
You're smoking pot.

316
00:35:19,766 --> 00:35:26,022
That's me. I'm wearing a plaid shirt,
camouflage pants, saddle shoes...

317
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:28,942
See how 'elite' I am?

318
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:32,737
This is what you should wear
in the studio scene.

319
00:35:32,904 --> 00:35:39,452
And for the killing scene... Jeans.
I wore jeans for killing.

320
00:35:39,661 --> 00:35:45,833
When you kill people, you should
wear thick pants. Like this...

321
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:51,380
- How about a checkered pattern?
- That'd be great, but small ones.

322
00:35:51,547 --> 00:35:57,428
To look cool,
I imitated movie stars.

323
00:35:57,595 --> 00:36:01,974
But I didn't copy Elvis Presley

324
00:36:02,183 --> 00:36:07,354
Herman, I'll make you
a gorgeous dress!

325
00:36:08,272 --> 00:36:12,568
- More energy!
- We're ready boss!

326
00:36:12,776 --> 00:36:15,904
Burn them all!

327
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:17,865
Finally you got it!

328
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:25,247
Cry 'What's going on, mom?'
'Leave us alone!'

329
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:32,087
Wait everybody!
Anwar show us how to kill.

330
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:37,676
You! Come here!

331
00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:43,640
What's going on?

332
00:36:43,848 --> 00:36:51,439
Who says I'm a communist?

333
00:36:56,569 --> 00:37:01,866
Hold him down!

334
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:04,410
Torture him! Kill him!

335
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:07,538
Are you listening?

336
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:11,834
Stop denying
you're a communist!

337
00:37:16,213 --> 00:37:18,841
- Okay fine!
- Leave our grandfather alone!

338
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:23,095
You take him, I'll take the kids!

339
00:37:25,389 --> 00:37:28,558
- You love these kids?
- Please stop.

340
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:31,144
Sit!

341
00:37:31,353 --> 00:37:35,857
- Or I'll smash this kid!
- Let me go!

342
00:37:36,024 --> 00:37:41,905
If you love these kids,
you better stop lying.

343
00:37:42,072 --> 00:37:44,616
It's your choice!

344
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:49,287
Cut!

345
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:54,208
Amazing!

346
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:09,890
Why do people watch James Bond?

347
00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:13,185
To see action.

348
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:19,650
Why do people watch films about
Nazis? To see power and sadism!

349
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:22,027
We can do that!

350
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:27,741
We can make something
even more sadistic than...

351
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:35,332
...more sadistic than what
you see in movies about Nazis.

352
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:37,667
Sure I can!

353
00:38:37,876 --> 00:38:43,048
Because there's never been a movie
where heads get chopped off-

354
00:38:43,256 --> 00:38:47,343
- except in fiction,
but that’s different -

355
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,514
- because I did it in real life!

356
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:06,404
<i>What's clear is no film
has ever used our method.</i>

357
00:39:09,198 --> 00:39:13,577
<i>We can attract a huge audience!</i>

358
00:39:13,744 --> 00:39:17,748
<i>Humor... it's a must.</i>

359
00:39:17,957 --> 00:39:21,418
<i>- Romance?
- We've got it!</i>

360
00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:26,006
Fuck this umbrella!

361
00:39:26,215 --> 00:39:29,218
Herman’s trapped.

362
00:39:29,384 --> 00:39:33,055
He should scream,
'Leave me alone! Stop! Stop!'

363
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:38,185
Meanwhile, the three of us scream,
'You communist bitch!'

364
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:43,440
Keep attacking her!

365
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:52,282
I'm gonna rape you!
I'm gonna kill you!

366
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:59,414
How long have you been pregnant?
You'll give birth to a communist!

367
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,625
But if the audience is
tense the whole time -

368
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:06,087
- with nothing to entertain them,
it will never work!

369
00:40:09,423 --> 00:40:14,512
On Saturday night,
I went to the movies.

370
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,226
Oh, I'm not gonna
shake my ass or anything.

371
00:40:20,434 --> 00:40:27,274
I watched the movie
alone with my girlfriend.

372
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:35,490
<i>The film was sold out</i> -

373
00:40:35,657 --> 00:40:42,456
- so I bought tickets from
the movie theater gangsters.

374
00:40:42,622 --> 00:40:46,084
<i>Oh how lovely..</i>

375
00:41:05,645 --> 00:41:13,402
- Adi! How’s the family?
- We're all fine.

376
00:41:15,154 --> 00:41:19,742
Was it a good flight?

377
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:24,163
- How've you been, Anwar?
- I'm fine.

378
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:28,917
- The city has changed a lot.
- Really?

379
00:41:29,126 --> 00:41:33,464
I've tried to call you many times.

380
00:41:33,672 --> 00:41:37,843
But you never answer my calls.

381
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:08,790
Your nose needs more.

382
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:15,838
- Do you remember Soaduon?
- Yes, where is he?

383
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:20,926
Over there. Soaduon Siregar.

384
00:42:21,093 --> 00:42:26,932
Now he takes credit for everything,
but back then he was nobody

385
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:30,602
I remember him.

386
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,906
- Adi, this is Soaduon Siregar.
- I remember you.

387
00:42:43,115 --> 00:42:47,327
He's one of Ibrahim's Sinik's
journalists.

388
00:42:47,494 --> 00:42:49,830
As they say:

389
00:42:50,038 --> 00:42:55,001
'Although camels live in Arabia,
they never get to visit Mecca.'

390
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:59,631
Being close to a rich boss
didn't make him rich.

391
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,760
Just like me.
Have a seat.

392
00:43:03,968 --> 00:43:07,680
Interrogation of Communist, Take 2

393
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:16,772
We give land to the farmers.

394
00:43:16,939 --> 00:43:21,902
We give them fertilizer, seeds,
farming equipment...

395
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:28,200
In order to spread
communism, right?

396
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:35,916
Indeed, we want to show that
the Communists are the best party.

397
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:43,131
Why do you recruit people
to join an illegal party?

398
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:48,679
But back then, it wasn't illegal.

399
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:53,475
- It wasn't?
- Before 1965? Of course not!

400
00:43:53,850 --> 00:44:01,107
It's easy to make the communists
look bad after we destroyed them.

401
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:06,738
So, the communists were not
more cruel than us.

402
00:44:06,946 --> 00:44:11,326
We were the cruel ones!

403
00:44:11,492 --> 00:44:15,371
'Cruel' is totally
different from sadistic.

404
00:44:15,538 --> 00:44:20,251
- No, it isn't. They're synonyms.
- No.

405
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:23,045
Sadism is different.

406
00:44:23,212 --> 00:44:26,507
- You're playing with words!
- No, I'm not.

407
00:44:26,716 --> 00:44:28,968
You're playing with words.

408
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:37,267
It bumped its head.

409
00:44:42,689 --> 00:44:49,321
Sometimes I think... if my dad
was a communist and was killed -

410
00:44:49,488 --> 00:44:53,825
- I'd be upset. That's normal, right?

411
00:44:57,329 --> 00:45:03,335
For example, if you killed my father
I'd be upset with you.

412
00:45:03,543 --> 00:45:05,837
Why'd you kill my father?

413
00:45:06,046 --> 00:45:10,884
Then, you don't let me go to school.
You don't let me work.

414
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:16,305
You don't even let me marry
This needs to be changed.

415
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:19,517
There's been no official apology -

416
00:45:19,725 --> 00:45:23,312
- but what's so hard
about apologizing?

417
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:27,316
The government would apologize,
not us.

418
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:31,654
It would be like medicine.
It would reduce the pain.

419
00:45:31,821 --> 00:45:36,992
- Forgiveness.
- Wouldn't they curse us secretly?

420
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:43,957
They curse us secretly..
Because if they cursed us openly..

421
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:49,296
They'd be arrested!
So they whisper their curses?

422
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:55,010
For me, Adi, in the end...

423
00:45:55,218 --> 00:46:00,307
I'm disturbed in my sleep.
Maybe because-

424
00:46:00,515 --> 00:46:05,979
- when I strangled people with wire
I watched them die...

425
00:46:06,187 --> 00:46:10,316
But when you used other methods,
you also watched.

426
00:46:10,525 --> 00:46:14,445
Yes, but when I'm falling asleep,
it comes back to me.

427
00:46:14,612 --> 00:46:17,365
That's what gives me nightmares.

428
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:26,040
You feel haunted
because your mind is weak.

429
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:29,627
Have you ever been
to a neurologist?

430
00:46:29,835 --> 00:46:35,758
If I went to a neurologist,
it would mean I'm crazy.

431
00:46:35,966 --> 00:46:40,888
No! Psychiatrists are not
for crazy people.

432
00:46:41,055 --> 00:46:47,644
Psychiatrists aren't for crazy
people. They're nerve experts.

433
00:46:47,811 --> 00:46:54,818
Even I've been to a nerve expert...
But for a mild stroke.

434
00:46:55,652 --> 00:47:02,617
See, your nightmares are just
a nerve disturbance.

435
00:47:02,909 --> 00:47:05,787
Come on, give it a try!

436
00:47:05,996 --> 00:47:12,085
If you see a shrink,
you talk, he talks.

437
00:47:12,293 --> 00:47:15,755
Then he gives you nerve vitamins.

438
00:47:27,308 --> 00:47:30,770
Remember the 'Crush
the Chinese' campaign in 1966?

439
00:47:30,978 --> 00:47:33,314
All along Sudirman Street -

440
00:47:33,522 --> 00:47:38,027
- I killed every Chinese
person I met. I stabbed them!

441
00:47:38,235 --> 00:47:45,701
I don't remember how many
but it was dozens.

442
00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:49,413
If I met them, I stabbed them.

443
00:47:49,621 --> 00:47:54,543
All the way to Asia Street,
where I met my girlfriend's dad.

444
00:47:54,751 --> 00:47:59,214
Remember my girlfriend
was Chinese?

445
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:03,969
'Crush the Chinese' became
'Crush my Girlfriend's Dad'!

446
00:48:04,177 --> 00:48:07,973
So I stabbed him, too!
Because he was Chinese!

447
00:48:08,181 --> 00:48:13,186
He fell into a ditch.
I hit him with a brick. He sank.

448
00:48:19,817 --> 00:48:24,906
Killing is the worst crime
you can do.

449
00:48:25,114 --> 00:48:28,534
So the key is to find a way -

450
00:48:28,743 --> 00:48:33,080
- not to feel guilty

451
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:36,626
it's all about finding
the right excuse.

452
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:42,715
For example, if I'm asked
to kill someone...

453
00:48:43,883 --> 00:48:50,806
If the compensation is right...

454
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:57,229
...then of course I'll do it, and
from one perspective it's not wrong.

455
00:48:57,437 --> 00:49:01,942
That’s the perspective
we must make ourselves believe.

456
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:08,657
At first, I was scared...
These are top gangsters!

457
00:49:08,865 --> 00:49:15,038
Like you and Anwar...

458
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:20,210
Terrifying!
And making a film! It's shocking!

459
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:23,880
But if you want a true story
I have one.

460
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:29,344
Tell us. Because everything
in this film should be true.

461
00:49:29,552 --> 00:49:34,348
There was a shopkeeper.

462
00:49:34,557 --> 00:49:38,936
He was the only Chinese person
in the area.

463
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:43,315
To be honest,
he was my stepfather.

464
00:49:43,482 --> 00:49:46,569
He was my stepfather..

465
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:50,489
But although
he was my stepfather-

466
00:49:50,698 --> 00:49:54,785
- I lived with him
since I was a baby..

467
00:49:54,993 --> 00:50:01,083
At 3 AM,
someone knocked on our door.

468
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:07,881
They called my dad. Mom said,
'It's dangerous! Don't go out.'

469
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:10,675
But he went out.

470
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:14,179
We heard him shout, 'Help!'
Then, silence.

471
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:18,892
They took him away
We couldn't sleep until morning.

472
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,521
- How old were you?
- 11 or 12...

473
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,482
I remember it well.

474
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:30,194
And it's impossible to forget!

475
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:34,907
We found his body
under an oil drum.

476
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:39,996
The drum was cut in half-

477
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,582
- and the body was under it,
like this...

478
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:47,002
His head and feet were
covered by sacks -

479
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,214
- but one foot poked out like this.

480
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:54,426
That same morning,
nobody dared help us...

481
00:50:54,635 --> 00:51:02,017
We buried him like a goat
next to the main road.

482
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:06,605
Just me and my grandfather
carrying the body-

483
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:11,693
- digging the grave... No one
helped us. I was so small.

484
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:20,076
Then, all the communist families
were exiled...

485
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:25,707
We were dumped in a shantytown
at the edge of the jungle.

486
00:51:25,915 --> 00:51:30,587
That's why to be honest,
I've never been to school.

487
00:51:30,795 --> 00:51:34,674
I had to teach myself
to read and write.

488
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:39,262
Why should I hide this from you?

489
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:45,643
I promise I'm not
criticizing what we're doing.

490
00:51:45,851 --> 00:51:51,107
It's only input for the film.
I promise I'm not criticizing you.

491
00:51:51,315 --> 00:51:54,652
Look, everything's
already been planned.

492
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:58,530
We can't include every story
or the film will never end.

493
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:05,746
And your story is too complicated.
It would take days to shoot.

494
00:52:05,954 --> 00:52:11,501
- Maybe we can work it in...
- Or it can motivate the actors.

495
00:52:13,587 --> 00:52:16,798
We believe this man's a communist.

496
00:52:17,924 --> 00:52:24,681
After we decided to kill him, there
were many reactions. Some prayed.

497
00:52:24,848 --> 00:52:30,270
- Come on, pray.
- 'God help me!'

498
00:52:30,436 --> 00:52:34,190
How do you tell him he's going
to die? Angrily or softly?

499
00:52:34,357 --> 00:52:41,572
I tried to make them accept
that they were going to die.

500
00:52:41,781 --> 00:52:46,160
Anwar teach us how to torture.

501
00:52:46,327 --> 00:52:50,581
'You want me to use this?'

502
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:55,085
- Should I scare him?
- Yes.

503
00:52:55,252 --> 00:52:59,882
You want me to use this?

504
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:05,596
Then, beg him not to.

505
00:53:05,763 --> 00:53:12,144
Now, take the cloth
and blindfold him.

506
00:53:12,352 --> 00:53:18,900
Josh always asks me,
'You worked in the same office -

507
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:23,029
- how could you not have known?'

508
00:53:23,196 --> 00:53:29,285
I declare: I never saw anything.

509
00:53:30,245 --> 00:53:37,669
Now, seeing your re-enactment,
I realize you were so smooth -

510
00:53:37,835 --> 00:53:43,341
- that even me, a journalist
with such sharp senses...

511
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:45,551
I never knew!

512
00:53:45,718 --> 00:53:53,726
I'm surprised. Because we didn't
hide what we were doing.

513
00:53:54,685 --> 00:53:59,648
- If you didn't know, I'd be shocked.
- I didn't.

514
00:53:59,857 --> 00:54:02,526
We were in the same office...

515
00:54:02,735 --> 00:54:07,656
- And we didn't hide it.
- I never knew.

516
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:16,832
You were so smooth, and I rarely
went upstairs to your office.

517
00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:22,879
- Your publisher directed the torture.
- No!

518
00:54:23,088 --> 00:54:26,424
- He says so himself.
- That's not true!

519
00:54:26,633 --> 00:54:33,765
He and the other leaders
decided who we killed.

520
00:54:34,557 --> 00:54:39,229
Look, I'm not calling you a liar,
but logically..

521
00:54:39,395 --> 00:54:44,567
- Continue, Adi.
- I'm not calling him a liar Joshua.

522
00:54:44,776 --> 00:54:52,783
But this man, a journalist distancing
himself from these things...

523
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:59,331
That's predictable. But logically
something we didn't hide...

524
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:04,920
How could he not know?
Even the neighbors knew!

525
00:55:05,087 --> 00:55:10,634
Hundreds were killed.
It was an open secret.

526
00:55:11,802 --> 00:55:17,432
- Drink!
- Have some water.

527
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,812
- Drink!
- It's not poison!

528
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:26,858
Drink! Just drink it.

529
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:33,907
- Drink it. It will refresh you.
- Give him a cigarette.

530
00:55:35,658 --> 00:55:38,745
Let him smoke.

531
00:55:38,912 --> 00:55:43,041
It's sadistic, Adi.

532
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:49,922
Ask him again about his activities.

533
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:56,220
Have mercy on me.

534
00:56:01,767 --> 00:56:05,771
Please, sir.

535
00:56:16,949 --> 00:56:19,993
Should we kill him?

536
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,374
Wait. Would you give a
message to my family?

537
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:28,001
Sure.

538
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:34,841
Or could I speak to them
one last time?

539
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,511
No way.

540
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:45,435
Okay pull.

541
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:57,238
Lower your head.

542
00:56:58,447 --> 00:57:00,783
He's dead.

543
00:57:04,578 --> 00:57:07,540
Wrap him up.

544
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:32,814
Listen, if we succeed
in making this film -

545
00:57:33,023 --> 00:57:38,320
- it will disprove all the propaganda
about the communists being cruel.

546
00:57:38,486 --> 00:57:42,032
- And show that we were cruel!
- We're the cruel ones.

547
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:48,788
If this film is a success! We must
understand every step we take here.

548
00:57:48,955 --> 00:57:53,126
It's not about fear
it's 40 years ago...

549
00:57:53,334 --> 00:57:57,255
...so any criminal case has expired.

550
00:57:57,463 --> 00:58:02,385
It's not about fear it's about
image. The whole society will say:

551
00:58:02,552 --> 00:58:09,350
'We always suspected it. They lied
about the communists being cruel.'

552
00:58:09,517 --> 00:58:13,812
it's not a problem for us.
It's a problem for history.

553
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:21,737
The whole story will be reversed.
Not 180 degrees... 360 degrees!

554
00:58:21,945 --> 00:58:25,073
If we succeed with this scene!

555
00:58:25,282 --> 00:58:33,290
But why should we always hide
our history if that's the truth?

556
00:58:34,416 --> 00:58:37,669
No, the consequence is...

557
00:58:37,836 --> 00:58:41,840
...that everything Anwar
and I have always said is false.

558
00:58:42,048 --> 00:58:44,718
It's not the communists
who were cruel.

559
00:58:44,884 --> 00:58:48,930
- But that’s true!
- I completely agree.

560
00:58:49,681 --> 00:58:54,686
But not everything true
should be made public.

561
00:58:54,978 --> 00:58:58,398
I believe even God has secrets.

562
00:58:59,857 --> 00:59:03,778
I'm absolutely aware
that we were cruel.

563
00:59:05,821 --> 00:59:09,575
That's all I have to say

564
00:59:09,784 --> 00:59:14,288
it's up to you what to do about it.

565
00:59:50,448 --> 00:59:56,537
I don't mean to make you
uncomfortable, but I have to ask...

566
00:59:56,704 --> 01:00:01,793
By telling yourself it was 'war',
you're not haunted like Anwar.

567
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:06,631
But the Geneva Conventions
define what you did as 'war crimes'.

568
01:00:06,797 --> 01:00:11,093
I don't necessarily agree
with those international laws.

569
01:00:11,302 --> 01:00:16,140
When Bush was in power
Guantanamo was right.

570
01:00:16,307 --> 01:00:21,812
Saddam Hussein had
weapons of mass destruction.

571
01:00:22,021 --> 01:00:28,777
That was right according to Bush,
but now it's wrong.

572
01:00:29,778 --> 01:00:34,783
The Geneva Conventions may be
today's morality but tomorrow -

573
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:39,413
- we'll have the Jakarta Conventions
and dump the Geneva Conventions.

574
01:00:40,664 --> 01:00:45,460
'War crimes' are defined
by the winners.

575
01:00:45,627 --> 01:00:49,547
I'm a winner So I can make
my own definition.

576
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:53,134
I needn't follow
the international definitions.

577
01:00:53,343 --> 01:00:59,515
And more important,
not everything true is good.

578
01:00:59,724 --> 01:01:05,188
Some truths are not good.
Like re-opening this case.

579
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:09,150
Even if everything you're finding out
is true, it's not good.

580
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:14,572
But for millions of victims'
families-

581
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:19,869
- if the truth comes out, it's good.

582
01:01:20,035 --> 01:01:25,457
Fine, but start with the first
murder Cain and Abel.

583
01:01:25,624 --> 01:01:30,003
Why focus on killing
the communists?

584
01:01:30,212 --> 01:01:32,756
Americans killed the Indians.

585
01:01:32,965 --> 01:01:36,802
Has anybody been
punished for that? Punish them!

586
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:41,139
For me, re-opening this case
is a provocation to fight.

587
01:01:41,306 --> 01:01:45,727
I'm ready! If the world wants
continuous war, I'm ready

588
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:49,940
if you wanna make
us fight, I'm ready!

589
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:56,696
What if you were brought to the
international court in the Hague?

590
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,866
- Now?
- Yes.

591
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:05,580
I'd go! I don't feel guilty
so why would I go?

592
01:02:05,747 --> 01:02:10,543
Because I'd be famous.
I'm ready!

593
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:16,257
Please, get me called
to the Hague!

594
01:02:21,595 --> 01:02:24,265
More hot!

595
01:02:27,851 --> 01:02:30,396
More hot!

596
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:37,027
I like this... Eye candy.

597
01:02:44,034 --> 01:02:48,413
This is healthy for a guy like me.

598
01:02:54,419 --> 01:02:56,880
Enjoy the scenery Ma'am.
Okay.

599
01:02:57,088 --> 01:03:00,592
- One, two, three.
- Ah!

600
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,553
- Again! One, two, three.
- Ah!

601
01:03:05,763 --> 01:03:09,225
<i>I was asked to run for parliament.</i>

602
01:03:09,434 --> 01:03:13,771
<i>'Why me?' 'Don't worry!
You can do it!' they said.</i>

603
01:03:20,278 --> 01:03:25,908
<i>Then I thought,
'Why not?'.</i>

604
01:03:26,075 --> 01:03:31,622
<i>In fact, I'm a perfect candidate
because I'm well known!</i>

605
01:03:47,512 --> 01:03:50,348
Don't clench your fist.

606
01:03:50,557 --> 01:03:53,101
Be quiet!
I've almost got it!

607
01:03:53,268 --> 01:03:56,813
- OK, but don't make a fist.
- You're ruining the sound!

608
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:59,858
- But...
- Stop it!

609
01:04:00,025 --> 01:04:05,155
Be quiet!
You're a real pain! Just shut up!

610
01:04:05,363 --> 01:04:09,742
Long live the Businessmen and
Workers Party! I am Herman...

611
01:04:09,951 --> 01:04:14,664
...ready to fight
for workers' rights.

612
01:04:14,872 --> 01:04:18,876
Remember to vote
for me on election day!

613
01:04:20,586 --> 01:04:26,634
<i>If I get elected and get
on the Building Commission -</i>

614
01:04:26,842 --> 01:04:32,306
<i>- I can get money from everyone.</i>

615
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:38,103
<i>For example, if a building
is 10 cm too small...</i>

616
01:04:39,563 --> 01:04:42,900
<i>I can demand
'Tear down the building!'.</i>

617
01:04:43,066 --> 01:04:47,237
<i>They'll say, 'Please don't report us.
Here's your money'.</i>

618
01:04:48,322 --> 01:04:52,617
<i>Even if nothing's
wrong with the building -</i>

619
01:04:52,826 --> 01:04:56,872
<i>- if I threaten them,
they'll give me money anyway.</i>

620
01:04:58,582 --> 01:05:03,545
<i>Not just a little money
In a block of 10 buildings...</i>

621
01:05:03,753 --> 01:05:07,298
<i>if each pays $10000,
just do the math!</i>

622
01:05:07,465 --> 01:05:10,885
That's already $100,000.

623
01:05:12,929 --> 01:05:15,223
That's only one neighborhood!

624
01:05:17,225 --> 01:05:24,023
Actually parliament should
bethe most noble place in society.

625
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:27,443
But if we see
what they do there...

626
01:05:27,652 --> 01:05:35,493
They're really just
robbers with ties.

627
01:05:37,703 --> 01:05:42,499
What illegal businesses are
Pancasila Youth involved in?

628
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:45,669
Gambling.

629
01:05:45,878 --> 01:05:49,923
Gambling, night clubs.

630
01:05:50,132 --> 01:05:52,342
Supermarkets.

631
01:05:52,551 --> 01:05:56,972
But that’s not illegal.
They just hire us as security.

632
01:05:57,139 --> 01:06:00,851
- The illegal ones?
- Gambling.

633
01:06:01,017 --> 01:06:03,770
- Any others?
- Smuggling.

634
01:06:03,937 --> 01:06:10,193
Illegal fishing, illegal logging,
illegal gambling...

635
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:14,364
...and if they don't pay
we blackmail them.

636
01:06:16,324 --> 01:06:18,826
Let's welcome our candidate,
Marzuki!

637
01:06:19,035 --> 01:06:22,163
Long live our party!

638
01:06:22,371 --> 01:06:24,081
Pancasila!

639
01:06:25,374 --> 01:06:28,711
Ready!

640
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,715
What am I supposed to say?
How does it begin?

641
01:06:32,923 --> 01:06:36,927
- What's the first sentence?
- I'm Herman.

642
01:06:37,094 --> 01:06:40,180
- I'm Herman!
- Stand up, you'll look better.

643
01:06:40,472 --> 01:06:43,726
Ladies and gentlemen... What
comes next? I can't remember

644
01:06:43,934 --> 01:06:51,191
I'm Herman, from the Businessmen
and Workers' Party!

645
01:06:56,279 --> 01:07:01,159
- Any free T-shirts?
- Nope... Ma'am, here's my card.

646
01:07:01,368 --> 01:07:03,829
T-shirts! We want presents!

647
01:07:04,037 --> 01:07:09,042
Don't worry about money or presents.
We'll come back with gifts.

648
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:12,253
Pray for us, hopefully he'll win.

649
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:15,173
Tell people
who ask for presents...

650
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,468
'We'll come back with gifts
if we win.'

651
01:07:18,676 --> 01:07:22,430
Tell them, 'We're filming today'

652
01:07:23,514 --> 01:07:26,976
- Don't forget.
- Just a card?

653
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:29,228
Where's 'the bonus'?
Don't we get anything else?

654
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:32,398
- 'The bonus' comes later.
- Once you're elected?

655
01:07:32,607 --> 01:07:37,903
- Honey where do you think you are?
- Yes, but...

656
01:07:38,696 --> 01:07:45,828
<i>Many of the parties
bribe people to vote for them.</i>

657
01:07:46,036 --> 01:07:49,081
<i>In fact, they all do.</i>

658
01:07:49,289 --> 01:07:53,418
<i>And when you see thousands
of people at a rally -</i>

659
01:07:53,585 --> 01:07:57,631
<i>- all of them
were paid to be there.</i>

660
01:08:01,134 --> 01:08:05,388
<i>They consider it going to work.</i>

661
01:08:06,932 --> 01:08:09,017
<i>Without money they won't come.</i>

662
01:08:09,226 --> 01:08:13,313
<i>They'll ask each other,
'how much did you get?'.</i>

663
01:08:16,441 --> 01:08:21,112
<i>And leaders just get paid more!</i>

664
01:08:26,534 --> 01:08:34,458
<i>Nowadays, nobody believes
in what they're campaigning for.</i>

665
01:08:38,379 --> 01:08:42,174
<i>We've all become
like soap opera actors.</i>

666
01:08:45,177 --> 01:08:49,056
<i>Our souls have become
like soap opera actors.</i>

667
01:08:49,223 --> 01:08:52,810
<i>They look happy,
but inside they’re pissed off!</i>

668
01:08:52,976 --> 01:08:56,772
<i>Fuck this shit, they're thinking.</i>

669
01:09:22,297 --> 01:09:24,799
Where's the injured one?

670
01:09:30,263 --> 01:09:33,474
Where’s the crippled one?

671
01:09:33,683 --> 01:09:36,769
- Which?
- The injured one.

672
01:09:36,936 --> 01:09:40,356
There she is.

673
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:44,860
- Sweet little duck.
- Don't! You'll hurt her again.

674
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:51,951
She's weak
because you broke her leg.

675
01:09:55,162 --> 01:09:59,833
Don't do that.
She's a baby!

676
01:10:00,876 --> 01:10:04,504
Say 'I’m sorry Duck.'

677
01:10:04,713 --> 01:10:06,923
- I'm sorry Duck.
- That's it.

678
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:11,636
Now say 'lt was an accident.
I was scared, so I hit you.'

679
01:10:11,928 --> 01:10:15,056
Say 'lt was an accident.'
Speak loudly.

680
01:10:15,223 --> 01:10:19,978
- Sorry Duck.
- And pet her a little.

681
01:10:27,694 --> 01:10:32,365
Now the communist
has become a ghost.

682
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:40,498
He was killed and became a ghost.

683
01:10:40,706 --> 01:10:43,376
- Haunting you.
- Haunting me.

684
01:10:43,626 --> 01:10:46,921
Do you feel trauma seeing this?

685
01:10:47,171 --> 01:10:53,594
If he came to me at night,
I'd be terrified.

686
01:10:53,802 --> 01:10:58,640
It's like the ghosts hate me.

687
01:10:58,807 --> 01:11:02,895
Because in my dreams they
have threatening voices...

688
01:11:03,061 --> 01:11:08,859
- They laugh, but frighteningly!
- Try to laugh.

689
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:16,783
Anwar's nightmare, take 2.

690
01:11:17,742 --> 01:11:18,827
Standby.

691
01:11:19,035 --> 01:11:20,245
Record.

692
01:11:32,966 --> 01:11:37,095
I thought I killed you!

693
01:11:40,223 --> 01:11:44,852
- What did I do wrong?
- Just get up, surprised.

694
01:11:45,061 --> 01:11:51,358
And ask, 'Why are you alive?'
What's so hard about it?

695
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:02,411
I... I thought I killed you!

696
01:12:27,894 --> 01:12:31,147
Why am I coming to this place?

697
01:12:33,191 --> 01:12:39,739
Because it affected me so deeply.

698
01:12:42,492 --> 01:12:46,495
Because the method of killing...

699
01:12:48,623 --> 01:12:52,001
...was very different.

700
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:59,008
And that's why I always
have nightmares.

701
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:04,179
Is it because I've been
telling you my story so honestly?

702
01:13:12,104 --> 01:13:19,277
Or maybe
the vengeance of the dead?

703
01:13:23,615 --> 01:13:28,119
<i>I remember... I said
'Get out of the car'.</i>

704
01:13:28,286 --> 01:13:32,123
<i>He asked,
'Where are you taking me?'.</i>

705
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:37,629
<i>Soon, he refused to keep walking...</i>

706
01:13:38,755 --> 01:13:43,593
<i>I saw Roshiman bringing me
a machete.</i>

707
01:13:45,803 --> 01:13:53,185
Spontaneously I walked over to him
and cut his head off.

708
01:13:53,394 --> 01:13:59,400
My friends didn't want to look.

709
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:03,737
They ran back to the car.

710
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:07,866
And I heard this sound...

711
01:14:12,162 --> 01:14:16,291
His body had fallen down...

712
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:21,797
And the eyes in his head
were still...

713
01:14:34,309 --> 01:14:39,105
</i>On the way home, I kept thinking,
why didn't I close his eyes?</i>

714
01:14:39,314 --> 01:14:44,610
</i>All I could think about was
why didn't I close his eyes?</i>

715
01:14:44,777 --> 01:14:50,575
And that is the source
of all my nightmares...

716
01:14:50,783 --> 01:14:57,248
I'm always gazed at by those
eyes that I didn't close.

717
01:14:57,415 --> 01:15:03,671
That's what always
disturbs me so very much.

718
01:16:13,781 --> 01:16:16,575
Slit his throat!

719
01:16:16,784 --> 01:16:20,495
Cut off his head!

720
01:16:25,876 --> 01:16:28,295
Hooray!

721
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:50,733
Did you take it?
Is it good?

722
01:16:50,942 --> 01:16:52,777
- Thank you.
- No, thank you, Sir.

723
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:57,198
No. With such a beautiful girl?
I should thank you.

724
01:17:00,076 --> 01:17:05,039
Too bad she bleaches her hair...
Makes her look like a whore.

725
01:17:10,002 --> 01:17:12,588
- Tell him about the car!
- What happened?

726
01:17:12,796 --> 01:17:15,382
There was this girl...

727
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:17,676
She sucked off six men -

728
01:17:17,843 --> 01:17:20,429
- and not a drop of cum on the floor.

729
01:17:20,637 --> 01:17:23,599
- Six men?
- She swallowed it all.

730
01:17:23,765 --> 01:17:27,769
And after the last guy finishes,
she's still sucking -

731
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:32,149
- like she wanted more!

732
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:46,996
Dear God, make our great
organization a pillar of this nation.

733
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:55,088
You know the price of the land?
200 million dollars.

734
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:59,300
I gave it to the birds.

735
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:05,389
So they have a happy life.
I'm also happy.

736
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:11,061
Everybody's terrified of
the paramilitaries.

737
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:16,900
So, when a businessman wants
land where people are living...

738
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:20,779
if he just pays for it,
it's expensive.

739
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:26,577
But we can solve his problem.

740
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:32,958
Because people are terrified of us,
when we show up -

741
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:37,629
- they say 'Just take the land.
Pay what you like.'

742
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:44,052
This is a rose.

743
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,846
Very very limited.

744
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:55,104
Elephant.
This is very very limited.

745
01:18:57,482 --> 01:19:01,569
I buy these
from every country I visit.

746
01:19:02,945 --> 01:19:06,240
Hungary
2,250 dollars.

747
01:19:40,732 --> 01:19:44,736
You've cut off my head...

748
01:19:44,945 --> 01:19:50,325
You have to be furious,
but also sad.

749
01:19:50,533 --> 01:19:55,580
You have to be angry sad.
Sadistic.

750
01:19:55,788 --> 01:19:58,791
Look at your blood!

751
01:20:02,587 --> 01:20:06,382
Look what I found
in your stomach!

752
01:20:12,763 --> 01:20:17,893
Look at this!
Your liver.

753
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:28,529
It's rotten!

754
01:21:18,327 --> 01:21:23,040
Even in make-up he looks like
he's from Ethiopia!

755
01:21:23,249 --> 01:21:29,088
- Tanzania. Like Idi Amin.
- Idi Amin Dada.

756
01:21:33,967 --> 01:21:40,098
Camera 3 on Citra!
Close up on Citra for the opening.

757
01:21:40,307 --> 01:21:44,436
Everybody ready?
Roll the leader!

758
01:21:48,732 --> 01:21:53,153
Indonesian National Television
'Special Dialogue'

759
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:58,032
Welcome back to Indonesian
Television's Special Dialogue.

760
01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:01,870
Today we meet movie theater
gangsters who are making a film -

761
01:22:02,036 --> 01:22:04,163
-to commemorate the
crushing of the communists.

762
01:22:04,372 --> 01:22:08,251
We go straight to the perpetrator
and star of the film, Anwar Congo!

763
01:22:08,459 --> 01:22:11,754
Let's welcome Anwar Congo!

764
01:22:12,964 --> 01:22:16,884
In those days movie theater
gangsters were very well known.

765
01:22:17,093 --> 01:22:20,471
What's the origin of
the word 'gangster'?

766
01:22:20,679 --> 01:22:24,767
Actually gangster comes
from 'free men'.

767
01:22:24,975 --> 01:22:30,147
That's why we use
a special song in our movie.

768
01:22:30,314 --> 01:22:36,028
A song called 'Born Free.'

769
01:22:36,195 --> 01:22:39,823
So you brought the communists
straight to your office?

770
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:47,539
Yes, and after we interrogated them,
and decided they shouldn't be alive-

771
01:22:47,748 --> 01:22:51,918
- we had to kill them.

772
01:22:52,127 --> 01:22:56,506
And was your method of killing
inspired by gangsterfilms?

773
01:22:56,673 --> 01:22:58,883
Sometimes!

774
01:22:59,092 --> 01:23:00,844
It's like...

775
01:23:01,052 --> 01:23:04,264
Amazing!
He was inspired by films!

776
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:09,936
Each genre had its own method.
Like in mafia movies...

777
01:23:10,144 --> 01:23:16,567
...they strangle the guy in
the car and dump the body.

778
01:23:16,776 --> 01:23:18,945
So we did that too.

779
01:23:19,111 --> 01:23:23,199
Which means Anwar
and his friends developed -

780
01:23:23,407 --> 01:23:27,328
- a new, more efficient system
for exterminating communists.

781
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:32,916
It was more humane, less sadistic,
and avoided excessive violence...

782
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:37,421
But you also just wiped them out!

783
01:23:40,632 --> 01:23:47,097
- How many people did he kill?
- About 1000.

784
01:23:47,305 --> 01:23:51,435
How can he sleep?
Isn't he haunted?

785
01:23:51,601 --> 01:23:54,855
- A lot of them went crazy.
- Yeah.

786
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:58,275
- No, they got rich.
- Yeah.

787
01:23:58,483 --> 01:24:02,195
Rich from stealing.

788
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:07,158
But killing all those people
made them crazy too.

789
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:13,873
But what’s the special meaning
of this film for young people?

790
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:19,921
Young people must remember
their history.

791
01:24:20,129 --> 01:24:23,924
They must never forget.
What's more...

792
01:24:24,133 --> 01:24:26,802
God must be against communists.

793
01:24:27,011 --> 01:24:29,472
Yes. God hates communists!

794
01:24:29,638 --> 01:24:32,975
That's why he's made
this film so beautiful!

795
01:24:33,183 --> 01:24:39,314
According to General Sarwo Edhie
2.5 million communists were killed.

796
01:24:39,523 --> 01:24:44,862
Why haven’t the victims'
children ever tried to take revenge?

797
01:24:45,070 --> 01:24:51,868
It's not that they don't want
to take revenge. They can't!

798
01:24:52,035 --> 01:24:56,164
Because we'd exterminate them all!

799
01:25:11,179 --> 01:25:17,810
This is the only film shoot to be
visited by a government minister.

800
01:25:18,019 --> 01:25:25,109
He's coming here just for you,
to motivate and support you!

801
01:25:25,276 --> 01:25:27,820
You should be proud!

802
01:25:35,494 --> 01:25:38,998
The whole world will see this.
London, England!

803
01:25:39,206 --> 01:25:42,084
Forget Jakarta.
Jakarta is nothing!

804
01:25:47,464 --> 01:25:51,593
Wow! All the killers are here!

805
01:25:56,973 --> 01:26:00,769
Just improvise
and express your anger.

806
01:26:00,977 --> 01:26:03,104
Scream, 'Crush the communists!'

807
01:26:03,271 --> 01:26:08,568
- Crush the communists!
- Wipe them out!

808
01:26:08,777 --> 01:26:11,279
Okay let’s try it.

809
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:16,326
Attack on Kampung Kolam. Take 1.

810
01:26:17,535 --> 01:26:21,497
Don't let any communists escape!

811
01:26:23,624 --> 01:26:27,920
Kill! Kill!
Kill the communists!

812
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:32,425
Slaughterthem!

813
01:26:32,591 --> 01:26:35,052
Are you ready to attack?

814
01:26:35,261 --> 01:26:41,183
Take no prisoners!
Destroy them all!

815
01:26:42,851 --> 01:26:46,105
Burn down their houses!

816
01:26:46,271 --> 01:26:52,444
Kill the communists!
Chop them up!

817
01:26:52,653 --> 01:26:57,366
Exterminate them to their roots!

818
01:26:58,742 --> 01:27:06,041
Chop off their heads
Burn them! Kill them all!

819
01:27:06,249 --> 01:27:10,003
Kill! Kill!

820
01:27:16,593 --> 01:27:21,806
Cut! Cut! Cut!

821
01:27:22,015 --> 01:27:29,063
Joshua and crew, now I'm speaking
as a leader of Pancasila Youth.

822
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:35,778
What we’ve just shown is not
characteristic of our organization.

823
01:27:35,945 --> 01:27:40,950
We shouldn't look brutal,
like we want to drink people's blood.

824
01:27:46,413 --> 01:27:53,462
That's dangerous
for our organization's image.

825
01:27:53,629 --> 01:27:58,133
But we must exterminate
the communists.

826
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:01,136
We must totally
wipe them out-

827
01:28:01,303 --> 01:28:06,266
- but in a more humane way.

828
01:28:06,474 --> 01:28:11,229
What we just filmed,
I felt awful...

829
01:28:11,438 --> 01:28:14,232
Especially with my image
right in the middle of it!

830
01:28:14,441 --> 01:28:16,860
OK, Joshua?

831
01:28:17,026 --> 01:28:21,489
This is the true story
That's what we all want, right?

832
01:28:21,698 --> 01:28:24,367
Sure. Sure.

833
01:28:24,575 --> 01:28:26,786
You know, what we just filmed...

834
01:28:26,994 --> 01:28:32,375
Don't erase it! Use it to show
how ferocious we can be!

835
01:28:32,542 --> 01:28:37,922
In fact, we can even be worse!

836
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:44,345
So, think of it as
a simulation of our rage -

837
01:28:44,553 --> 01:28:49,391
- if anyone disturbs our country

838
01:28:56,315 --> 01:28:59,818
If they're pretty I'd rape them all.

839
01:28:59,985 --> 01:29:06,950
Especially back then,
when we were the law.

840
01:29:07,159 --> 01:29:08,577
Fuck 'em!

841
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:12,539
Fuck the shit
out of everyone I meet.

842
01:29:12,706 --> 01:29:17,419
Are you a communist woman?

843
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:21,214
What are you hiding there?

844
01:29:21,381 --> 01:29:24,050
That’s the spirit!

845
01:29:24,259 --> 01:29:29,180
Especially if you get one
who's only 14 years old.

846
01:29:29,389 --> 01:29:30,973
Delicious!

847
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:37,230
I'd say it's gonna be hell for you
but heaven on earth for me.

848
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:40,107
Keep struggling.

849
01:29:40,316 --> 01:29:43,110
No one wants to be tortured, right?

850
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:46,280
If you can save yourself,
you should.

851
01:29:46,489 --> 01:29:50,784
And if you can
run away go ahead!

852
01:29:50,993 --> 01:29:53,120
Attention everybody!

853
01:29:53,329 --> 01:29:56,999
While you're acting,
remember the cameras!

854
01:29:59,084 --> 01:30:02,879
Ladies, think positively

855
01:30:03,088 --> 01:30:05,924
if you think positively -

856
01:30:06,133 --> 01:30:12,013
- your acting will be great
and the scene will succeed.

857
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:14,224
Positive! Think positive!

858
01:30:52,344 --> 01:30:55,139
Kill them all!

859
01:30:57,599 --> 01:31:01,145
Catch him!

860
01:31:52,862 --> 01:31:57,324
Cut! Cut! Cut!

861
01:32:01,453 --> 01:32:04,456
Bakti! Bring water!

862
01:32:23,141 --> 01:32:27,145
Let her rest.

863
01:32:53,421 --> 01:32:59,593
Febby your acting was great.
But stop crying.

864
01:33:00,844 --> 01:33:07,392
You're embarassing me.
Film stars only cry for a moment.

865
01:33:14,524 --> 01:33:19,529
What I regret... Honestly I never
expected it would look this awful.

866
01:33:27,078 --> 01:33:32,125
My friends kept telling me
to act more sadistic -

867
01:33:32,292 --> 01:33:37,797
- but then I saw
the women and children.

868
01:33:40,049 --> 01:33:43,094
Imagine those children's future.

869
01:33:43,302 --> 01:33:45,680
They've been tortured...

870
01:33:45,888 --> 01:33:48,975
Now their houses
will be burned down...

871
01:33:49,141 --> 01:33:52,853
What future do they have?

872
01:33:53,896 --> 01:33:58,859
They will curse us
for the rest of their lives.

873
01:33:59,068 --> 01:34:02,613
This was so very very very..

874
01:35:06,842 --> 01:35:09,386
When you say 'karma'...

875
01:35:09,595 --> 01:35:14,099
What does it mean for you?
What are you afraid of?

876
01:35:15,601 --> 01:35:23,608
Karma is like a law of nature.

877
01:35:27,487 --> 01:35:32,200
A law straight from God.

878
01:35:38,915 --> 01:35:42,043
Imagine, in all this darkness -

879
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:49,050
- it's like we're living
at the end of the world.

880
01:35:50,218 --> 01:35:54,639
We look around...
There's only darkness.

881
01:35:58,309 --> 01:36:01,645
It's so very terrifying.

882
01:36:29,923 --> 01:36:35,553
Hit the table.
To frighten me.

883
01:36:35,762 --> 01:36:39,891
Start by hitting the table. Hard.

884
01:36:54,405 --> 01:36:58,534
Trying to ban American films
in Indonesia?

885
01:36:58,701 --> 01:37:01,912
What are you trying to do?

886
01:37:03,748 --> 01:37:05,666
Shut up!

887
01:37:05,875 --> 01:37:09,962
- What are you trying to do?
- Please, sir..

888
01:37:10,129 --> 01:37:14,633
Don't get friendly with me!
We're not friends!

889
01:37:14,842 --> 01:37:17,052
Answer the questions!

890
01:37:17,219 --> 01:37:22,182
Hurry up
or I'll break your legs!

891
01:37:22,391 --> 01:37:25,727
Dana, ask!

892
01:37:25,894 --> 01:37:29,898
Besides Titi Kuning,
where else are you active?

893
01:37:30,107 --> 01:37:34,486
- Hamparan Perak.
- A real big communist.

894
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:39,240
Quick! Don't waste our time!

895
01:37:41,117 --> 01:37:44,454
Lift up your hand
or I'll cut it off.

896
01:37:44,662 --> 01:37:49,000
Hey look! Gold!

897
01:37:49,167 --> 01:37:53,546
Take off your watch.

898
01:37:53,755 --> 01:37:57,967
Put it on the table.
What else do you have?

899
01:37:58,134 --> 01:38:01,596
A ring? Gold?

900
01:38:01,804 --> 01:38:05,725
Talk or I cut your face.

901
01:38:05,891 --> 01:38:09,895
- Talk.
- Tell us everything!

902
01:38:10,062 --> 01:38:15,609
- Please, don't...
- I won't, but you talk!

903
01:38:15,776 --> 01:38:18,821
Talk...

904
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:22,074
Cut.

905
01:38:38,298 --> 01:38:40,967
Okay let's do it.

906
01:38:54,105 --> 01:39:02,113
I place this medal
around your neck.

907
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:52,996
- Are you alright?
- I can't do that again.

908
01:40:16,435 --> 01:40:20,397
Get him some water.

909
01:40:24,234 --> 01:40:28,322
Have some water.

910
01:41:07,026 --> 01:41:12,406
<i>We shoved wood in their anus
until they died.</i>

911
01:41:13,658 --> 01:41:17,578
<i>We crushed their necks
with wood. We hung them.</i>

912
01:41:17,787 --> 01:41:22,500
<i>We strangled them with wire.
We cut off their heads.</i>

913
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:25,669
<i>We ran them over with cars.</i>

914
01:41:29,423 --> 01:41:31,592
<i>We were allowed to do it.</i>

915
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:36,889
<i>And the proof is, we murdered
people and were never punished.</i>

916
01:41:43,019 --> 01:41:46,815
<i>The people we killed... There's
nothing to be done about it.</i>

917
01:41:47,023 --> 01:41:50,110
<i>They have to accept it.</i>

918
01:41:50,527 --> 01:41:55,532
<i>Maybel Im just trying to make
myself feel better but it works:</i>

919
01:41:55,740 --> 01:42:00,828
<i>I've never felt guilty, never been
depressed, never had nightmares.</i>

920
01:43:19,322 --> 01:43:27,329
For executing me
and sending me to heaven.

921
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:33,585
I thank you a thousand
times, for everything.

922
01:44:04,908 --> 01:44:08,661
This is great, Joshua.
This is very good.

923
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:14,709
I never imagined
I could make something so great.

924
01:44:16,544 --> 01:44:19,964
One thing that makes me
so proud -

925
01:44:20,172 --> 01:44:24,302
- is how the waterfall
expresses such deep feelings!

926
01:44:28,431 --> 01:44:36,105
You know the scene
where I'm strangled with wire?

927
01:44:38,482 --> 01:44:41,777
- Do you have it here?
- Where you're strangled?

928
01:44:41,985 --> 01:44:44,613
Please put it on.

929
01:44:49,993 --> 01:44:51,995
Yan?

930
01:44:52,162 --> 01:44:55,874
I want him to watch this...

931
01:45:02,088 --> 01:45:05,967
- Yan?
- He's in bed.

932
01:45:07,469 --> 01:45:12,181
Yan, watch the scene
where grandpa is tortured and killed.

933
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:17,020
Ami, come see grandpa beaten up
and bleeding.

934
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:19,272
But this is too violent.

935
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:23,234
Watch this.
Grandpa gets beaten up.

936
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:27,113
Turn up the volume.

937
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,825
But this is too violent, Anwar
Are you sure?

938
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:33,619
Yes, it's fine.
Will you be scared, Yan?

939
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:43,879
This is only a film...
Look at that.

940
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:49,551
Grandpa looks so sad,
doesn't he, Yan?

941
01:45:49,718 --> 01:45:52,095
So scary

942
01:45:53,138 --> 01:45:58,018
it's so sad, isn't it?
That's your grandpa.

943
01:45:59,102 --> 01:46:04,524
That's grandpa being
beaten up by the fat guy.

944
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:07,777
Grandpa's head is smashed.

945
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:50,235
Did the people I tortured feel
the way I do here?

946
01:47:00,912 --> 01:47:05,208
I can feel what the people
I tortured felt.

947
01:47:05,417 --> 01:47:13,425
Because here my dignity
has been destroyed...

948
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:18,304
...and then fear comes,
right there and then.

949
01:47:18,471 --> 01:47:23,559
All the terror suddenly
possessed my body

950
01:47:23,768 --> 01:47:28,439
it surrounded me,
and possessed me.

951
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:35,738
Actually the people you tortured
felt far worse-

952
01:47:35,946 --> 01:47:40,951
- because you know it's only a film.
They knew they were being killed.

953
01:47:44,330 --> 01:47:48,333
But I can feel it, Josh.
Really I feel it.

954
01:47:48,542 --> 01:47:54,006
Or have I sinned?

955
01:47:58,677 --> 01:48:03,265
I did this to so many people, Josh.

956
01:48:04,975 --> 01:48:08,895
Is it all coming back to me?

957
01:48:15,068 --> 01:48:21,950
I really hope it won't.
I don't want it to, Josh.

958
01:49:31,267 --> 01:49:36,272
This is where we tortured and
killed the people we captured.

959
01:49:59,503 --> 01:50:02,339
I know it was wrong -

960
01:50:02,965 --> 01:50:06,677
- but I had to do it.

961
01:51:16,119 --> 01:51:19,247
This is...

962
01:51:22,709 --> 01:51:27,797
This is one of the easiest
ways to take a human life.

963
01:51:31,759 --> 01:51:34,220
And this...

964
01:51:35,638 --> 01:51:40,601
This was used to take away..

965
01:51:43,854 --> 01:51:47,274
...the human beings we killed.

966
01:51:47,483 --> 01:51:50,319
Because without this...

967
01:51:51,737 --> 01:51:55,699
...maybe people would know.
